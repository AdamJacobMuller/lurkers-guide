<h1>If pages won't load...</h1>
<p>
Almost everyone who has complained of partially-loading pages has reported
that they're running Trumpet Winsock 2.0 revision B.  I believe the problem
doesn't occur with more recent versions of Trumpet, so if you're seeing partial
pages, you should probably upgrade.

<p>
Trumpet Winsock is available from
<a href="ftp://ftp.trumpet.com.au/winsock/">ftp.trumpet.com.au.</a>
As of this writing, the latest version was 2.1F; it's shareware, but version
<a href="ftp://ftp.trumpet.com.au/winsock/old-vers/">2.0E</a>
is also available and is free.  Either ought to fix the problem.

<p>
If you're seeing partially-loaded pages and you're <em>not</em> running
Trumpet Winsock, please <a href="mailto:koreth@midwinter.com">send me mail</a>
and tell me which network software you're using, including the version number.
(I'm not talking about Web browsers here; I want to know what you're using to
actually send data out over the net.)
