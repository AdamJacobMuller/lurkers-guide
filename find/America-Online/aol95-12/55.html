<PRE>{CJ Cherryh deals with similar themes.  Will scripts be made available?}

      Actually haven't read much if any of CJ's work, though I really should
have.  The notion of hard choices, and responsibility, of course goes way
back through early literature and into myth.  
      Re: scripts...we do hope to make a limited number of them available
through the fan club, once that gets going, but that's about it.
