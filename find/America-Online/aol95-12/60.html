<PRE>     Blacnight...this is really becoming pointless.  For one thing, you're
not listening to anyone else.  You come on here, and point to A...people
answer you, and explain or respond to some of your concerns about A, but then
you've moved on, you don't even deal with the question of A anymore, you've
moved on to B...and people try to respond to B, and now you point over there
to C.  You plainly have no interest in a conversation or a discussion, you
haven't answered any of the objections to your prior messages, you just come
in here to state and restate your position.  You're all over the place.
First you bring up Baywatch, then you say you don't care about Baywatch, you
flip all over the place.

     My bottom line, frankly, is that yes, of course there's racism in
society, nobody's debating that.  If that's the point you're trying to
communicate, then nobody here is going to dispute it.  But by speaking of all
caucasian people the same way, accusing them of all having the same behavior,
you are every bit as racist as those you complain about, and that's another
issue you've danced away from.  If I came on here and said about african
americans the kinds of things you've said about caucasians I'd be branded a
racist, and they'd be right.  

     In an early episode of season one (at risk of actually mentioning B5 in
this conversation), Sinclair makes the comment that "when you become obsessed
with the enemy, you become the enemy."  You have become obsessed with the
enemy.

     Anyway, this is the last response you'll get from me.  It's painfully
apparent by now, having given you every opportunity to show otherwise, that
you are not interested in a conversation, only in stating and restating your
position.  So the exercise becomes pointless.
