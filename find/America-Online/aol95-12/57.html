<PRE>      I think that in the larger scope, many things are going to happen
regardless...World War One would've almost certainly happened even without
the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand, but it might have happened later,
might have taken on a different form....

     But there's a great deal over which we *do* have free will.  Things
*can* be changed; if they can't, then there's not much point to living.  The
characters like to think they have no choice to comfort themselves with the
decisions they've already made.
