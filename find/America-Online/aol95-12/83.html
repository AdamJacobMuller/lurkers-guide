<PRE>{Is Ellison still working on his Dream Corridor books?  Did his story "Kadak"
inspire Ivanova's Chanukah celebration?}

     Last I heard, the Dream Corridor books will be coming out in a different
form, in larger trade editions, with new stuff.

     No, "Kadak" had nothing to do with Ivanova celebrating Chanakuh on B5;
the ceremony far predates Harlan's story....
