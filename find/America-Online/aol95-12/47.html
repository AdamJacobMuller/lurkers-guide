<PRE>     Lisala: Thanks.  We try to emphasize the voice of the storyteller as
much as possible, that we are creating...well, I don't want to say creating
new mythologies, because I don't think they are really created, they stretch
back to the foundations of civilization, and show up repeatedly in works of
literature...but reinterpreting and reinventing and clarifying the structure
of myth for a new generation.
