<PRE>      Mythopile: okay, maybe you don't care about keeping topics to their
intended use.  That's fine.  I have received mail from people who stress that
they are on limited incomes, and when they come in here, they only go into
specific forums because they can't afford to spend a lot of time on AOL.  And
they like to be able to know that when the click into a topic on Clams In B5
that they won't have to wade through a bunch of messages on other subjects to
find what they're looking for.  

     I have never, at any time, "thrown some guy" out of a folder.  I have
asked, simply, and only in a very few cases, that people try the folders
where their comments will reach the widest audience, since someone interested
in religion will go there first, and someone interested in ratings will go to
tha topic first, as a courtesy to the other users here.  Nobody here is going
to force you to be courteous.  I cannot do anything about it.  I can only
suggest courtesy.
