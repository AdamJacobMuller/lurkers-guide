<PRE>      The issue at hand is courtesy.  I know that a lot of people here want
to discuss other areas than religion; there is a religion topic that is where
religion messages should go, just as notes on merchandising go in
merchandising, and items on ratings go in ratings...it makes it easier to
find the topics that interest you, and keeps the conversation from being
monopolized across various folders.  

     As I told you in private mail, very often your messages on religion
really have *nothing* whatsoever to do with B5, but rather with the issues
that are of importance to you about religion, gays, whathaveyou...and you
thus shoehorn them in...you do it here, you've done it over in the B5 folders
in the SF-Television areas...and what happens is that the religion wars that
erupt, due in some measure to some of the rather inflammatory tone you use,
tend to keep other users away who just don't want to see it One More Time.

     But there are religious elements in the show that can be
discussed...hence I made it a point to open such an area.  Use it.  That's
what it's there for.  If someone were to put up a long note on ratings, I'd
point them to the ratings folder, simple as that.  Yes, it is your right to
say anything you so choose...and it is the right of myself and others to ask
you to show courtesy to your fellow users by doing so in the appropriate
forums.  Is not courtesy usually considered the christian thing to do?
