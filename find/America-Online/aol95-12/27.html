<PRE>{Similarity to La Morte D'artur: Arthur's and Mordred's armies are poised
for battle but make one last attempt to negotiate, but a soldier raises
his sword to kill a snake and everyone attacks.  Compare this to the
emperor's peace overture in "The Coming of Shadows."}

      There's another applicable metaphor for the sword story; you'll see it
a little later this season.  Very good catch, btw.
