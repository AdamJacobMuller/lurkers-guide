<PRE>     Generally speaking, very few actors are online; Pat Tallman is over on
Compuserve here and there, Stephen Furst and one or two others come online
here from time to time...bits and pieces here and there.  Mainly, if there's
a message of interest, cast members find out by its being posted on the News
