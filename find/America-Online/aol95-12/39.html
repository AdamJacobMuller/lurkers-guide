<PRE>{White Star related to DS9's Defiant?}

      The White Star was always in the plans for the series; it's an
outgrowth of everything that has gone before.  We've seen big warships,
dreadnoughts, smaller ships, and personal fighters.  This fits right in.  If
you're going to have a war over a long distance, you kinda need something to
get in and out with.

      I actually don't watch DS9 as a rule, so I really can't comment on its
current storylines.
