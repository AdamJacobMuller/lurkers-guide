<PRE>{Re. "The Gathering," you said the person standing outside a door in one
scene would turn out to be important.  How?}

      I'm not entirely sure what this refers to; the only possibility that
comes to mind is that when the assassin finds Del Varner, he gets access via
a panel outside the door, and we either hear or see "Laurel Takashima,
Cleared To Enter."
