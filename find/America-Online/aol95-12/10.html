<PRE>     Hogan: thanks.  And at this point, we're in no particular jeapordy of
being canceled; the ratings keep improving, slowly, but it's there, and the
folks at WB have openly discussed the notion of our fourth season long before
those words would usually ever come out of their mouths, so we'll probably be
okay.
