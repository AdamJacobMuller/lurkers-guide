<PRE>{Was Garibaldi at Lyta's ship because the Rangers told him she was coming?}

     No, Garibaldi was there because the ship's ID# didn't check out, as he
stated, and it could've been in the process of smuggling or who knows what.
The "soldier/diplomat" comment came more from shaping where this season is
going.
