<PRE>{B5 reference in the X Files?}

       Don't know if the beacon reference was toward us or not; but it's
still a great show, though it's getting a little convoluted even by their
standards lately.  Still, I'll keep watching....

      Re: elevators...at risk of repeating stuff I've said elsewhere...every
so often, I'll see a note from somebody saying that this show only gets by
because of its effects, that without that part it ain't nothin'...and just to
honk 'em off I'll sit down and write a killer scene with just one or two
characters in a room, no EFX, sometimes not even any music...and I often go
for the smallest room in the station...and that happens to be the transport
tube.
