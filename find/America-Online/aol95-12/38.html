<PRE>{how often are actors paid?}

     In the case of the regular actors, and the producers, you are paid a
certain fee per episode contracted for (22 episodes for regulars, 13 or 8 for
recurring cast members, 22 for producers).  That amount is then broken up
into about 50 weeks (I think maybe 40 or so weeks for actors, John Copeland
can probably be more specific on this), and you thus get a weekly check based
upon that.
