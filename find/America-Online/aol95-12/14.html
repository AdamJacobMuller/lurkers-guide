<PRE>{"Passing Through Gethsemane" -- the interrogation scene was disquieting.}

      Yes, that's definitely the sense I was going for.  That scene frankly
unsettles and scares me a little, because it does show our characters
skirting the line...yes, it's absolutely necessary, every moment is precious
if they're going to try to save Edward's life...but it's still a bit creepy.
