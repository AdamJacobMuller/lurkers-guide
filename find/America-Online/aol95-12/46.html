<PRE>{Don't call Star Trek a franchise.  They take big risks.}

     AcDec...all I can say is that you should talk sometime behind closed
doors, as I have, with many of the writers and producers who have worked, and
still work, on the various ST versions, who WANT to tell stories with teeth,
that challenge, but who are prevented from doing so by the suits eager to
preserve ST as an inoffensive franchise.  Sorry, but the logic still parses.
