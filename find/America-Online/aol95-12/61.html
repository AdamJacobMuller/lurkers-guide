<PRE>{About the B5 presentation at Westercon in Phoenix, 1992}

     I remember that presentation, and it shares something special with
LosCon right before that.  At the time of the convention, all I had was my
word on the kind of show I wanted to do, my rep, and about 30 seconds of a
clip showing a ship docking at a beta version of B5.  That's it.  And even
though producers for TeeVee series are always coming in proclaiming that
their new show is the best thing since sliced bread, even though time and
time again we (speaking as a fan myself) it ends up being just another awful
show with genius kids and cute robots...even with all that, and so little to
show for what I had in mind...fans both in Phoenix and at LosCon sidled up to
the video clip, considered it, and the few other elements I brought to the
table...and said, basically, "Let's give the kid a chance."  It speaks
volumes of the willingness of SF fans to extend themselves, despite getting
repeatedly burned, when most needed.

     I've always been very moved by that, and whenever I've gone back (though
I forgot this last time), I've always asked, "Did I keep the promises I made
back then?"  The answer has always been yes.
