<PRE>{Who won the sixth game of the "59 series?}

     Mars won the sixth game, but it was a squeaker, 5-4.  That tied it up
going into the seventh game, which Earth won on an RBI that Mars is still
challenging on the belief that the guy was really out at home, but that the
umpire was catering to pressure.
