<PRE>{about writing plays}

     The play format varies a little here and there; I'm addressing this in a
rewrite I'm finishing now of the writing book.

     Re: the number of episodes I write...basically, it's just the number I
feel is right to communicate the sense of the show in that season.  One of
the main reasons I *created* B5 in the first place was to make a show I'd
like to watch, and to write for.  So now that it's here, I'm following up.
