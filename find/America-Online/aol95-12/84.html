<PRE>       We've finally received the paperwork on the fan club, and one of the
things we plan to do is sell replica communication Links manufactured by the
same sub-contractor company that produces the actual props, so they're 100%
authentic; same with the EA pins and patches and some other stuff.  So hang
tight, you may get your wish.
