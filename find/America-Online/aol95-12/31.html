<PRE>{this is the B5 themes topic; religion is a theme in B5.}

      Yes, religion is a theme in B5, Filops...unfortunately, you never
*address* it...you only use this as a pretext to get into one of your long
diatribes about what you consider acceptable behavior, acceptable social and
sexual mores.  You use this only as a way to springboard into those
discussions.  I've seen you do it repeatedly over on the SFTV forums, and it
troubles me to see you doing it again here.
