<PRE>{Will there be more female leads?  Will we see the Talia/Ivanova relationship
mentioned again?}

     I do see Lyta's role growing in the show, in the hopes of her becoming a
recurring character (main title) in time, and there are a couple of other
female characters I'm thinking about, but I don't generally think in terms of
quotas, 4 to 2 or 5 to 3 or whatever...you have to decide what works best for
the show and the story.  

     As for Talia/Ivanova...there's some closure to that right around
mid-season, which definitely clarifies their relationship.  Suffice to say I
think you'll be pleased.
