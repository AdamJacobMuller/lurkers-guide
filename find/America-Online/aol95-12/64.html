<PRE>{Who's your SO?  Has she written for B5?}

     Her name is Kathryn M. Drennan, and yes, she wrote "By Any Means
Necessary" for B5.  She has written for other shows, mainly in the animation
area, and has worked as a journalist or feature reporter for newspapers and
magazines, including Twilight Zone Magazine, Women's World, and others.

     It was difficult at times with her doing a B5 script because I kept
second-guessing myself too much on my reactions, and I ended up making her
jump through a lot of hoops that nobody else had to go through because I have
a real problem with even the *appearance* of nepotism, so she ended up
working twice as hard as was probably necessary.  So far this season she
hasn't come across a story she'd like to write, so it's a moot point.
