<PRE>     Just a note to mention that due to the lengthy lead times required by
national magazines, espeically those with an entertainment bent, that some
pieces are considered evergreens, and can be published anytime.  You build up
material until you're ready to go.  The piece in EW with Bruce came via an
interview conducted toward the end of the long summer slump caused by reruns.
Hence his comments.  They improved once the new episodes came back on again.
