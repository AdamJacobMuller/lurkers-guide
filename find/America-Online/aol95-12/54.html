<PRE>      Basically, any attempt to break down the B5 story into pure good vs.
pure evil is going to fall apart sooner or later.  The thematic elements
point to greyer areas: will you lead, or will you be led by others?  What is
your responsibility to the world around you, and how far will you go before
you do something drastically wrong?  The key themes in this show are choice,
and responsibility.

     How different would this story be if Londo had simply chosen *not* to go
the easy way and go to Mr. Morden?  We are here because he made certain
choices, and now he has to live with them.  Actions have consequences.
