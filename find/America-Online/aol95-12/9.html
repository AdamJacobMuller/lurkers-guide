<PRE>{you're letting Creation do B5 merchandise?}

     We're aware of the rep that Creation has, and I've been very open in my
criticism of them when they've done something dumb, both in my talks with
them privately, and on the nets.  They know that if they do a Dumb of Bad
Thing, I'm going to call them on it.  I'll also note when they do things
right.  And thus far, for the most part, they've done okay by B5.  I've
worked closely with them on the licensing aspects, and some of it is really
quite cool, and the rest is fine.  (They have come out with two recent items,
a B5 leather jacket (a bit over-priced, I think, but extremely cool
nonetheless), and B5 mugs with the logo on one side, and the silhouette on
the other in silver against black that's just *killer*.)

     I don't feel sufficiently comfortable at this time to do a B5 convention
with them; but I have made an occasional personal appearance, and found that
they are genuinely interested in trying to straighten out their rep.  A great
deal of the problem stems from the fact that they often work with local folks
in the area as hosts who often don't know what they're talking about.  So now
they're cutting back a little, trying to do fewer, better, than a lot, less
efficiently.
