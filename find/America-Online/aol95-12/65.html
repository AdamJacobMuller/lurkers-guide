<PRE>     Only a very few stations have dropped B5, mainly because there isn't
room any longer on their schedules due to an influx of UPN and FOX shows to
which they have prior commitments.  These number less than about 5 or so out
of something like 198 stations, and in several cases other stations have
jumped in and happily picked up the contract.
