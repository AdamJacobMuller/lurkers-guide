<PRE>{If Ivanova is with a man, she'll be perceived as straight instead of bi.}

      Which, of course, is exactly *why* one cannot write to the current
political agendas on any side of the issue, because they're transitory,
they'll change in two weeks.  If you start saying, "Well, this kind of person
is *now* perceived THIS way this week, so I should change the story," you'll
end up chasing your tail (also chasing your tale) and soon you lose all sense
of direction.  So you do what's right for the story, and let the chips fall
where they may.
