<PRE>     In general, I've really had to stay away from anything even resembling a
story idea on the nets, so I don't use them, and haven't.  As for other
shows, my sense as a fan myself is that the more quality SF on the air, the
better; we've actually given tours and provided information on how we make
this show to other producers so that they can use the "Babylon 5 Model" in
helping to bring more SF to television.  The more the merrier.
