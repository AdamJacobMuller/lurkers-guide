<PRE>      How Sheridan and Garibaldi got away with it?

      "Telepath?  What telepath?  Never happened.  Can you describe her?  No?
I see.  Well, I don't remember seeing anyone in there, Mr. Garibaldi, do you?
We'd check the logs to be absolutely sure, because we'd hate for this sort of
thing to happen, but we had a small glitch in the software, and the recorders
didn't work...still, we're working on it, and we hope to have it taken care
of in the next few months.  Would you like some more tea, Ambassador?"
