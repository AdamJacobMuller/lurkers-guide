<PRE>      The reason Laurel Takashima/Tamlyn Tomita is not currently on the show
is because the actress didn't feel really comfortable in the role of a
military commander, and felt she might do better in other kinds of roles,
such as that which came along about the same time in a major motion picture;
she is now a highly-sought-after film performer.  When she opted out, I went
instantly after Julie Nickson, an asian actress to play Catherine Sakai,
Sinclair's love interest, a recurring role in the show.

      And check my message uptopic...there's a racist here, all right, and
it's you.
