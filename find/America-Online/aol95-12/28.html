<PRE>{God is the core of Christianity, not an emotion or a moment.}

      Filops: take it to the religion topic.  That's what it's there for.  If
you wish to write long polemics on religion, that's fine, but do it in the
appropriate place.  I really don't want bunches of topics to get filled up
with rehashings of this stuff.  Thanks.
