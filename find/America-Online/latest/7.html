<PRE>This is one of those questions that's kind of like asking the magician to
tell you where that rabbit REALLY came from...and to look at the alternate
universe possibiliities of the story, and I'm just barely adequate to keep
THIS story going without looking at all the permutations, which would just
make me get confused and fall down....
