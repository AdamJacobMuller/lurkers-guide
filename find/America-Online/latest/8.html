<PRE>"I just heard a Rumour from one fan; he mentioned that **you** were
interested in continuing development of Space: Above and Beyond on the WB
Network (Fox just cancelled it), and that you were going to tie in the Chigs
with one of the secondary races of B5...in an "alternate" fashion."

Funniest thing I've heard all day.....
