<PRE>"As a cure for the creative souls among us, may I humbly offer the following
suggestion: create a new folder strictly for B5 Fan Fiction"

Absolutely positively no way.  

Yes, the B5 storyline is set.  Could we win any case in court?  Yes.  Do I
want to spend three years of my life or thereabouts giving depositions,
talking to lawyers, and spending hundreds of thousands of dollars and the
aggravation involved in all this?  No.  Not because somebody wants to toss
out a story idea and later decide he wants to sue.  

No fan fiction, no story ideas.  Or I'm outta here.  That's tough to say, and
to hear, but that's the only request I make in exchange for being here.
