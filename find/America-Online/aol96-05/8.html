<PRE>The story kind of came in all at once; and yes, in a way, it's the story I've
been preparing to write from day one.  The eclectic, weird background I have
is what enables me to tell this story this way.  This is, I think, my seminal
work in the field.  To invoke greater names for a moment, Heinlein wrote lots
of books, but he's known for Stranger in a Strange Land; Frank Herbert wrote
lots of books, but he's known for Dune.  I've done a lot before this, and
hope to do a lot after, but I suspect that this is what I'll be most known
for when it's all said and done.
