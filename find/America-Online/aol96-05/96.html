<PRE>Thanks, and I remain happy to be here.

On the writing and the scenes you cite...a story, *any* story, should be
designed not just to take you through the mechanics of a plot, but to make
you *feel* something.  Those, for me, are the elements I look for when I
watch something, and when I write something.  If I'm not on the verge or
tears in writing Kosh's fate, you won't be that way watching it.
