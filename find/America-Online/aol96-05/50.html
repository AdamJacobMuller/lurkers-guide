<PRE>Actually, both those questions are answered in the next installment, so I'll
let that answer for me.

Yeah, I lov language, the way it can snake around behind you and turn into
something else when you're not looking.  The alchemy of metaphor and the
well-chosen allusion.  Banging words together is half the fun.
