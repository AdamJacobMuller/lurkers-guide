<PRE>When they shot the scene itself...no, not a lot of emotion in the Kosh
sequence in his quarters, because it was all very technical, bits and pieces.
But in the hallway scene with Sheridan, and the later scene with Delenn and
the others...yes, very much so.

It was *extremely* difficult to write.  As a writer, the only way to evoke a
feeling in your audience is to feel it yourself and communicate that honestly
in the text.  It was just awful.
