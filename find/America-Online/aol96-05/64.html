<PRE>"1.  In the unthinkable, will you wrap up the storyline this season, or is
that too late?"

After the conclusion of this season, there are basically 3 major movements
remaining in the symphony (for lack of a better description).  They fit
comfortably in 2 seasons, leaving room to do the usual routine of starting
each season with 4-5 standalones, and layering in other standalones along the
way, some non-arc personal stories, and so on.

If they came to me, put a gun to my head and said, "Okay, year four is it,
wrap it up," yes, it could be done.  You just yank out the standalones and
interstitial stuff I put between major movements, and shove the three pieces
together.  It's not what I'd *prefer*, obviously, but it could be done.
