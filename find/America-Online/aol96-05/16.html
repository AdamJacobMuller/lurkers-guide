<PRE>Well, remember that we never defined what those feelings were between
Sinclair and Delenn; she had a great deal of respect and admiration for him,
yes.  And she had a fair measure of faith in him as well.  Question is,
what's the root of that?  We'll learn some of that in the two-parter.  As for
Sinclair, he was mainly involved with Sakai.
