<PRE>I already answered your question posted here in email.  To repeat what I said
then....

The fan club will be selling only a very few items, most of it designated as
fan club stuff (i.e., "Babylon 5 Fan Club" t-shirts or posters), on a limited
scale.  It won't be producing nearly enough to cause even a blip in the
direct marketplace arena.
