<PRE>"Sitting here reading the spoilers, questions, comments and answers with my
husband.  He doesn't believe its you answering these comments.  I, on the
other hand, never thought about it."

If the message has my initials on it, assuming it's not an imposter like the
jerk who wandered into an IRC the other day...it's me, and ONLY me.  You'll
note the writing style is always the same in every message, and elsewhere.
I'd never entrust this to an assistant or anything similar, because I'd get
the rap if something incorrect were said..and nobody else knows the show as I
do.

It's me.

Whether that's good or bad remains to be seen.
