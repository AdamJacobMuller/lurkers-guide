<PRE>There will be models...in the fullness of time.

As to sitting back and looking at the show...right now, I'm still way too
close to it to do that.  When I look at any of the episodes, all I see are
the flaws.  The things that could've been better.  Stuff nobody else notices,
but I know it's there.  In time, I'll be able to look at them objectively,
but not this soon.
