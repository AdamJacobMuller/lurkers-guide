<PRE>If I can make a suggestion....

Please try to avoid packing a message with 5, 7 or 10 questions or more; the
odds are that I won't be able to answer all of them, or even most of them.
The problem with the AOL interface is that if I use the Read New command,
once it pops up, if I log off the point where I came in is lost.  If I take a
long time to answer 7 questions in one message, the odds are good that I'll
either get bumped or have to go do B5 stuff and won't get to the other
messages/questions, and it's hard to backtrack afterward.  It's also a bit
more than I find manageable, given that when you combine all the services I'm
on, about 500 messages per day flit in front of my corneas.

So if we could keep the questions down to just a couple per message, it'd
help me a lot.
