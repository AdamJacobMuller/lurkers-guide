<PRE>1.  How far will Delenn and sheridans relationship go?

You'll find out in the two parter, to a large extent.

2.  Why are the shadows attacking everyone?

Good question.  We'll get that by season's end.

3.  Is B4 going to become a big part of the storyline?

In a sense.

4.  Do the vorlons have a large amount of ships?

Depends on your perspective.

5.  Is B5 going to be renewed?

We remain cautiously optimistic.
