<PRE>"In WWE(1)I noticed a larger than usual group of offhand lines (ethel
&amp;.../wait in car.../cool-you know what I'm talking about).  Was this
scripted?  Or was someone just ad libbing?"

There's almost NO ad-libbing allowed on the show.  You can't change a word
unless someone comes to my office and approves it, and it can't change the
meaning.  (I.e., the actor is having a hard time saying "shibboleth" or
something.)  Everything said in this show is scripted, offhand comments
included.
