<PRE>Stuff will start going out soon.  For one thing, we're getting a crush of
memberships, and rather than keep sending out dribs and drabs, we're trying
to do stuff all at once to make it simpler for mailing, copying, printing and
the like.  The first newsletter is finished, and should be going out shortly,
and the poster is being somewhat redesigned 'cause I wasn't quite happy with
what we had, it could be improved, and that's what we're doing.
