<PRE>No, I don't laugh about it...it's always an interesting, sometimes
fascinating process.  If there were any consistent error I've seen, it's the
tendency to focus on the little tiny things, and thus miss the big things
I've just wheeled onto the stage in full view.  If you're going to do this
show right, you have to play fair; so the person standing way in the
background of a scene, just passing by, an extra, isn't likely to be very
important, for instance...but people seem to leap after that one.  I
sometimes get cute in my foreshadowing, but I try not to be obscure.
