<PRE>"Would YOU categorize Babylon 5 as a Science Fiction show, or a Drama?  I
know that it is set in a Science Fiction setting, but the storylines and such
are really, I think, in the Drama category.  What do you think?"

I have no problem calling it a science fiction, or SF (which also includes
speculative fiction) show.  I know a number of writers in TV who hate the
term, deny that what they're doing is SF, but I'm proud that it's SF, and
would definitely classify it as such.
