<PRE>I followed Harlan as host.  After Mike passed away, he gave it to Harlan, who
did it for a year, then Harlan passed it to me, and I managed to stick with
it for five years.  I'm trying to remember when I finally left...I think it
was around 1992-ish.  I opted out for many reasons, among them that I felt it
was a conflict of interest to be making an SF series at the same time that I
was hosting a radio show that covered stuff like SF TV series.  I enjoyed
doing the show -- a 2-hour weekly gig on a high-power radio station in LA, no
commercials, doing anything I wanted -- but ethically I had a real problem
continuing when B5 became a reality.
