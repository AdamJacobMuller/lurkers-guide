<PRE>The figures have come in for our first non-rerun episode, "Voices of
Authority."  The numbers of any show always drop in reruns; something that
some folks tend to avoid mentioning when they just post figures without
noting these things.  But moving on....

While KUNG FU, in its new episode, went from #50 to #61 for the week in
syndicated shows (this is out of 257 syndicated shows total, btw), B5 surged
from #54 to #41, with a 3.5 rating, well above that which is guaranteed to
advertisers.  

(DS9 continues to wobble; #16 last week, and #15 this week; they haven't been
in the top ten for a while now.  This in reply to some who asked for a
relative positioning.)

At #41 out of 257 shows, B5 is in the top 1/6th of all syndicated shows
overall, about the top 16% or thereabouts.  In terms of drama shows, B5 is in
the top 10 of all drama shows for that period, at #8.  

So far, so good.
