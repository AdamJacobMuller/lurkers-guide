<PRE>Just one thing to bear in mind in all this, referring to ST bashing...you
don't have a situation here of B5 fans "bashing" ST.  What you tend to have
are ST fans who've *always* had some concerns with the shows expressing their
concerns here, because they also watch B5, and because to express some of
this in other forums gets them yelled at.

While there are many ST fans who have not seen B5, there are no B5 fans who
have not seen ST.  What you have here is an internal ST situation, not a case
of B5 fans hitting a show they don't know about or watch.  I'd venture to
suggest that most of the concerns voiced here are ones they had long, long
before there WAS a B5.

That said, I've noted from the beginning that there was no reason to hold the
shows up side by side; they're different series, and that just puts ST at the
center of the fictional universe.  Let this show be its own creature.
