<PRE>1) Who writes the blurbs each week in TV Guide?  Is it someone involved with
the show, or someone at PTEN, or just some shadow somewhere?

If by this you mean the actual listings themselves...they're written by TV
Guide staffers, as I understand it.

2) Is there a timeline that lists the approximate day/month/year that each
episode takes place?  If so, could you post it?

I don't have one available outside the show, since it's very detailed and
has, well, EVERYthing in it, past and future...but there's one at the
hyperion website (available here via the www jumpgate) that's pretty darned
thorough.

3) You say that after B5 ends, there is a possible "spin off" that _could_
happen, but probably won't be made into a TV series.  Have you considered
either a novel or a series of novels?

Considered and considering...but for now, I have to focus on this.
