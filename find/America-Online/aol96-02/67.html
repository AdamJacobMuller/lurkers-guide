<PRE>"Was the "package" mentioned in Exo the blonde woman giving us the Mars
Shadow info? Or was it the eggs and bacon?  Or have we not seen it yet?  

Yes, the package referred to Kirkish.

"It seems Sheridan is destroying his Shadow ships by using tricks - not a
straight up battle.  At some point won't he be one on one with a Shadow and
have to deal with it?"

Sooner or later.  Right now he's outgunned hideously.  He'll have to find a
way.

"At some point won't Sheridan have to fight Earth? (I really don't expect an
answer to this one)"

Stick around.
