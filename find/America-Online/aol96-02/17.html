<PRE>The episode is in the halfway mark, and that IS its significance, because it
signals a major change.

When we were midway through that episode, the halfway mark of the whole
series, John, Doug and I were given these spiffy leather script books with
silver inlaid initials by the crew, to commemmorate the event.  It was really
nifty.
