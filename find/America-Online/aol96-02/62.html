<PRE>I've been over all this a hundred times with others, on other forums.  Or
forii.  Yes, all of the reasons that you cite could be used in winning a
lawsuit.  But I have no desire to spend the two years of my life fighting
such a lawsuit.  If story ideas get posted, I turn to vapor, it's that
simple.
