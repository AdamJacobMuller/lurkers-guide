<PRE>Because it takes a certain amount of power, effort and skill to get detailed
information about someone.  A P5-P7 can get strong emotions, some details, in
brief bursts, but they're not always  as good on the big picture.  A P10 is
needed for strong scans, particularly if the person is resisting.  That means
a psi cop, and they're all registered.
