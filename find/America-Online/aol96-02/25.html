<PRE>{Here is a question I've been thinking about for a while. If the Icarus was
sent to Z'Ha'Dum about 3 years ago, and the Vorlons and Minbari have known
about the Shadows return now for over 4 years, and it was also suggested
somewhere else that Earth Gov may be involved as far back as 5 years ago, is
it possible that Interplanetary Expeditions knew what would be found when
they sent the Icarus to that planet?}

The crew of the Icarus may not have known as much as they could've about
their mission.
