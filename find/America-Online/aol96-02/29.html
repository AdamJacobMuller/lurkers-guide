<PRE>Thanks.  We have heard that more shows are starting to adopt both our
production methods, and doing more arc stuff, so that's a good thing.

Personally, I thought "Exogenesis" was okay, but not one of our best, mainly
for writing reasons (i.e., my fault).  But from here on out, they're spiffy.
You're in for a real treat in a few more days when "Messages" airs.
