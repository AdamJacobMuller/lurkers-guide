<PRE>{Did I miss an episode?  (I can never get our stations right out here)  Last I
saw, Steven was getting hooked on stims, than last week he's happy go lucky
chattin with Marcus and being a lovable goof.}

It hasn't come to a head yet.  Any abuser of substances has moments when he's
up, and moments when he's down, moments when he seems fine, moments when he's
not.
