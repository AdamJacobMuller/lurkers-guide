<PRE>What's being lost here, though, is that this show operates on the level of
metaphor as much as it operates out in the open.  The shadow war is also the
war within ourselves as much as it is Out There.  So Nightwatch, the
political situation back home, are shadow wars of their own.  

That said, however, there's shooting aplenty in the course of this season.
