<PRE>Here's an example of this, btw.  On another service, someone without
considering what he was saying (not his fault, it just happened) said, in
essence, "What if somebody on B5 found out that he had been mind-wiped, and
used to be something awful previously?"

Well, I'd had "Passing Through Gethsemane" on the wire at that time, but when
I saw this, I had to scuttle the story.  It lay there, untouched, for over a
year, until I could finally meet the fellow and get a signed release
indicating what'd happened.  If that fan had not been fair and reasonable,
that episode -- which many consider one of our best -- would never have been
made.
