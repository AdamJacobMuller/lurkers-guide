<PRE>{Why noy free ourselves from syndicators and go for the big screen?}

At the moment, that's not my choice, you need a big studio backing you for a
big movie.  Also, B5 was primarily *designed* for TV, this is the venue I'd
prefer to work in for this.  You'd have to do 55 movies to tell the whole
story, and you couldn't do much arc stuff in it, because it would have to be
fairly self-contained.  The good wishes are appreciated, though.
