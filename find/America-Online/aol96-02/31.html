<H2>Eating Crow...</H2>

<PRE>{A few weeks ago I posted a message stating that it would be nice to have a
few skirmishes before the final showdown with the Shadows.  At the time I
feared you were saving too much for the end of the season. 

I just watched MESSAGE FROM EARTH.}

Like we said, we know what we're doing.  You just gotta trust us.  Sometimes
we get cranky because someone says "nothing's happening this season with the
shadows," and we're looking at an episode like "Messages" or others
forthcoming, and we know what IS coming.

A little patience is a good thing.

But you need not eat crow over it; just nibbling at the feathers will
suffice.
