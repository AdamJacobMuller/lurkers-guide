<PRE>{2) With six appendages for the males and six slots for the females, I kinda
wonder if the Centauri are capable of multiple births on a regular basis.
Care to comment on that?}

No multiple births, in that sense, not any different than humans.

{1) Although the capital of the Earth Alliance (Earthdome) is located in
Geneva, it seems to me the basic legislative structure is like the United
States, albeit in a unicameral setting (I see only the Senate). Did you plan
it this way, and have you ever thought about doing a historical
article/presentation on Earth history until the Babylon 5 setting?}

Your analysis on the governmental situation is pretty accurate; the Senate in
this case comprised of member nation/states, with smaller ones having less
voice than the bigger ones (like the Russian Consortium, the North American
Federation, and so on).
