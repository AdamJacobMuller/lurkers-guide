<PRE>1) There was an outsider, Kirkish, in the room.  Yes, she's helped him, but
he's still going to hold back some info because he doesn't know what impact
it might have on Sinclair.  He's protective of him.

2) Yes, Kosh should've been there.  Kosh wasn't.  Kosh hasn't been carrying
his weight, if you ask me.  I hope this doesn't cause a problem somewhere....
