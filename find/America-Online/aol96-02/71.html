<PRE>{The real reason Sinclair is gone? RATINGS! WB didn't feel he was helping the
ratings. They wanted a better known actor. An old story, but true.}

There were only the following people in the room when Michael and I discussed
the prospect of his leaving the show to return in another capacity at a later
date: me, Michael, Doug Netter and John Copeland.  You are none of these.

Further, at the time we had this conversation, the ratings were on one of
their usual upswings after reruns.  

You know *nothing* of this situation.  You're just going off what you assume
to be true.  But assuming it and saying it doesn't make it true.
