<PRE>DLyulkin...exactly.  You don't just take something and transplant it
wholecloth...you change and modify it.  Nightwatch was never meant to be on a
one-to-one corrolation to the SS, or Stasi, or McCarthy...the whole POINT is
that this kind of mentality crops up in new forms from time to time, in
different names, different approaches, but at its heartmeat core the same
thing.  By saying it's "That over there," we can relax, since that specific
incident can't recur...making us vulnerable to the next version.
