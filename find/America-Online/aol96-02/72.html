<PRE>{I am interested in your thoughts as to whether the will be a life
for the surviving B5 charcters after the 5yr story arc.   You have created a
universe that is rich and varied, and it would be a shame to see it just end
after this much creative talent has been lent to it's birth }

There's always been a side-story that could go off after the 5 years, though
the odds are slim and none.
