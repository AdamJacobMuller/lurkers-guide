<PRE>{Joe,   Do you take into account the ability of the SPFX crew to realize a
shot when you are writing an episode ?}

Generally, I write whatever the scene requires; most times, I find out that
the efx folks can deliver *more* than what I had in mind.  I don't think I've
had to pull back once yet.
