<PRE>{Just curious, but what was with all the MacBeth references in "Exogenesis?"}

Just figured I'd use that description of it rather than Macbeth, to make it a
bit more obscure, but also some actors do have a problem saying the name
Macbeth or being around it when it's said (note: Jason isn't one of them). so
it was also a courtesy.  (Later on, while shooting "A Late Delivery From
Avalon," one of the hair dressers made the error of referring to Macbeth out
loud in front of Michael York, and had to go through the whole undo-the-curse
routine, walking around the stages three times, etc.)
