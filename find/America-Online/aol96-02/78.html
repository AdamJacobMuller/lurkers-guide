<H2>Messages from Mars?</H2>

<PRE>{6.  And isn't Sheridan the least bit upset that Kosh wants him to do
everything without help, even if it costs him his life?
7.  Can you tell me the dimensions of a Shadow ship or the WhiteStar?  I'm
guessing that a Shadow Mother-Symbiotic-Terror Ship has a 'spine-span' of
about 2 kilometers at least, maybe even two miles; is this close?}

Don't have the shadow dimensions offhand; and yes, you'd think Sheridan might
begin to wonder about Kosh's level of involvement.
