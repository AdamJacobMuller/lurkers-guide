<PRE>I think it came out of the fact that Garibaldi doesn't trust ANYthing about
Bester, and that it's not out of the realm of possibility for Bester to find
some way to defeat the drug.  If not, then his line was basically another way
of stating "What the ___ are you pulling and why are you doing it and why the
hell didn't you TELL me you were going to do this before pulling it?"
