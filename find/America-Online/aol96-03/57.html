<PRE>I enjoyed the Equalizer, though I didn't see all the episodes, and it wasn't
anywhere in my head when I was coming up with the show.  

The key to *any* good character is to make them real.  You have to invest a
lot of yourself into that process, differentiating how they move, walk, talk,
think, believe.  It's a lot of work, but the result is worth it.
