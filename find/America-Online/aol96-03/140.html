<PRE>Exactly.  I think the process of transcending is much more interesting than
*having* transcended.  The struggle is what's dramatic.  

Re: n'grath...while that didn't work as well as I'd've liked, I'm still
looking to explore some alternate ways of showing alien (non-humanoid) life
forms.  We'll get there.

BTW, I note that you use semi-colons correctly in your messages...it's a tiny
thing, but it's the sort of thing rarely done anymore; the semi-colon seems
to have become a form of vestigal punctuation.
