<PRE>"...you're doing the same thing without the pain of two "bad" records."

Hrmmm...I dunno about that.  There are a number of things I've done in the
course of learning my craft that I wouldn't necessarily want to put back on
the air just now.  It's like the first time you learn carpentry; eventually
you can make swell stuff, but you know that hidden in the other room is the
napkin holder you made where the angles don't come together, the glue is
visible, the dowels don't quite fit properly....

Any form of art is trial and error.  You make the same mistake 999 times, so
the 1,000th time you don't make that mistake anymore.
