<PRE>Sometimes things slip through; the on-screen writing was done at Foundation,
since we don't have that capability, and they did it left to right.  I wasn't
able to be on set at the moment we shot that to check (and, likely, wouldn't
have been able to change it if I had been there, since we had to go and it
takes time to re-do that stuff).  Normally, however, Narns write right to
left.
