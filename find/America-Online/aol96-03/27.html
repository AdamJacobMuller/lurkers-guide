<PRE>We could've easily played the EFX full-screen, as WB used them in the promos,
after all.  But it's a slow tease, a reveal.  You do it big in Messages, hold
it back just a bit, at arm's length, in PoNR, then bring it all REAL close
again in the next episode.  By putting it at some remove in PoNR, it makes
the viewer almost like one of those in the Zocalo, fighting for a better
look, stranded out far away, trying to figure out what's going on.
