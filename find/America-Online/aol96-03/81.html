<H2>What type of Government E</H2>

<PRE>Each nation/state on Earth has its own government internally, and its own
leader, who is part of the EA Senate.  One senator per nation/state.  (Mars
is treated as a colony rather than an independent entity, same with the more
important colonies, while other, less valuable ones are more loosely
attached.)  Clark has full military control as Commander of Chief of
Earthforce, though the military is funded jointly by all participants.
