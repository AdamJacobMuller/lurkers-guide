<PRE>At this point, we're still assuming we'll be renewed, so it's a moot
question.

The larger issue comes down to commercials, though.  To get national
advertisers, you need X number of stations, in Y markets, carrying Z
commercials, preferably on two nights (first run and rerun).  If you can't
get national sponsors, paying enough money, it doesn't matter if the show is
over, on, or under budget...you're a dead duck.
