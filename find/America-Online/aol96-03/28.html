<PRE>We hope to have Harlan's script for next season.

"I hope that perhaps you have done some searching in areas of your faith as a
result of that episode."

No.  Don't see any reason to do so.  I wasn't *exposed* to that episode, I
*wrote* it, the same way I'd write a convincing show about Minbari...I don't
have to believe they exist to write convincingly about them.

I keep being astounded that others are astounded that an atheist can write
well about religion without being religious.  Writing is writing.  Characters
is characters.  Either you're honest as a writer, or you ain't; either you're
telling a story, or you're using the medium for propaganda.
