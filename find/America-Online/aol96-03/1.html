<PRE>{how about giving us fans one of those infamous cryptic
previews of the things we can expect in April and March....Please!!!!!}

How do you like your crow?  Medium?  Well-done?  It can't be rare because
crows are hardly ever rare.

What's coming up?  Hmmm...the world is turned upside down, other people turn
their backs on everything they think they believe in, a voice comes from the
distant past, there's a change in fashion sense, there's romance (intended
and unintended), heroics, the return (as it were) of Babylon 4, revelations,
revolutions, treaties and a whole lotta gunfire.
