<PRE>I won't know until April/May.  The main issue, I think, is going to be the
second-runs in most markets.  It wasn't a problem the first two years, but
now with so much new syndicated product on the market, the logical and
understandable reaction is, "Why should I rerun an episode of one show when I
can put on a *new* episode of *another* show and make *more money*?"  But the
advertising is sold based on double-runs in some cases, or at least a certain
percentage of double runs.  So we'll have to see.  I am, for now, cautiously
optimistic.
