<PRE>Thanks...and yes, soldiers are soldiers, female or male.  I see no reason,
barring some small differences in upper body strength, which can be
compensated for, to make female characters any less active physically than
male characters.  

Frankly, in watching the Tyson/Bruno match on Showtime the other night, the
best fight of the whole evening was the pre-fight with the two femal boxers
who went the distance and showed incredible heart and determination.
