<PRE>Cristine: thanks.  For what it's worth, I have always admired/been attracted
to strong, capable, intelligent and witty women.  I like independence of
thought, and nothing delights me more than being surprised, or topped in a
verbal exchange.  And I've seen some women police officers and soldiers who
could clear out a bar without even breaking a sweat.  Several women friends
of mine are very much into the martial arts.

Wimmin iz peoples too.  I don't understand why some folks have such a hard
time with that concept.
