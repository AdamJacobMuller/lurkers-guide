<PRE>G'Quan was the greatest of the Narns, a prophet, a religious figure of great
proportions; G'Lan was one of those second-tier types who showed up
afterward.  (The comparable human analog would be if G'Quan -&gt; Mohammed,
G'Lan -&gt; Angel.

(And yes, I know I've crossed religious structures there.)
