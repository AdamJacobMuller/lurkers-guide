<H2>Renewal Process</H2>

<PRE>The renewal process for B5 is a little different than the norm, due to the
PTEN structure.  It works in two parts, as I understand it.  (If I'm
incorrect on any of this, I hope that any of the onlooking WB folks will set
me straight.)

Part one comes from the stations.  Each market looks at the show, and how
it's doing in their area, which is a combination of ratings and demographics,
and sometimes audience support for a show, though the first two always take
precedence over the third.  They then decide whether or not to offer to take
the show for another season.

Part two comes from WB and the national advertisers.  As the stations line up
yea or nay, you keep a running tally of how *many* stations, when they want
to air it, and if they want to do a double run or not.  You need a certain
percentage of major markets, national coverage, to get national sponsors; and
you need to guarantee them a certain number of viewers.  Best if you can
deliver a certain *kind* of viewer, the kind advertisers look for.

The last part of WB's decision is if the show is profitable for the company
given all of these elements.  (WB gets the advertising money for national
spots in general, while local stations can sell other spots for local
sponsors, generating their income.)  Unlike most TV shows, which can run at a
deficit for a number of years, on the theory that they'll make it up in
long-term syndication, our show and Kung Fu have to show a profit *from the
word go*.  So the bear is much closer to us at all times.

The problem that all syndicated shows are currently running into is that of
diminishing berths for their programs.  Most communities have, at most, 1 or
2 local independent stations.  When B5 went on the air, these were all
available to us.  Since then, the Warners Network and UPN have come into
existence, with contractual requirements mandating x-hours per week for their
programs.  And Fox stations have grown, expanded their range of programming.
So now you find that there are fewer and fewer available timeslots for
syndicated shows not affiliated with one of these weblets.  A number of new
syndicated shows announced recently have been pulled for the simple reason
that they can't find enough stations that have available slots.

It's a noose around our neck that we're definitely aware of, particularly
given the importance of double runs for the national sponsors, which is even
*more* difficult given the current glut of programs and the few slots
remaining.  The game is trying to finish the story and get out before the
noose closes around our neck.  

It's going to be tight....
