<PRE>I'm involved in the comics and novels, but the problem with the novels is
that I get only a few days to review the manuscript before it has to go back,
and given everything else I'm doing, sometimes I miss things.  I try to keep
it as close to the show as I can, but there are always going to be glitches
when you let it out of your direct supervision and into the hands of others.
