<PRE>I suggest you go to the opening menu here in the B5 area, for the www
jumpgate; then go to the Lurker's Guide, which has info on every episode of
the series to date, well presented.  That should bring you up to speed on
year one, since they don't plan on rerunning anything from year one until
we've finished our run.
