<PRE>The impact of other alien races on contemporary religions is a good question,
and one that I hope to carve out some time to examine down the road a bit.
The Foundation was a way of saying, in essence, that there aren't various
religions, there's just *human* religion as opposed to what has been
developed on other worlds...that every human religion is an aspect of the
whole, like blind men describing an elephant by each holding onto a piece of
it.  They looked to the foundation of all religions, and combined them, so
there's aspects of nearly every major and minor belief in them.
