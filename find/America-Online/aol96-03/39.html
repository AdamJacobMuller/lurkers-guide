<H2>marcus and the link</H2>

<PRE>I just summoned up Marcus in my head.  Here's what he said: "Because I won't
wear the bloody thing, that's why.  Bad enough you've got those pagers you
wear in 1996, no privacy, no chance to get away, always at somebody's beck
and call.  Why not just put a leash around your neck and get it over with?
It'd be faster and a good deal more honest.  I'm down in the bar trying to be
inconspicuous, dangerous characters on all sides, trying not to be
noticed...and the link goes off, and I'm dead.  Or at minimum seriously
thumped.  No, absolutely not.  You'll never get me to wear one of those."

(This is btw the reason why I absolutely *refuse* to wear a pager myself.)
