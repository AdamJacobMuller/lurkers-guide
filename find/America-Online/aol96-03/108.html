<PRE>Every line an actor speaks is written down in a script; the actor's task is
to find the character in that, and breathe life into it via the performance.
So when someone asks, "who creates the character?" one can say the writer
creates, and the actor interprets...but at the same time, that really isn't
indicative of the vast contribution brought by the performer.  Londo in the
hands of any other actor but Peter wouldn't be *Londo*.
