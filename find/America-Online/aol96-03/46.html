<PRE>I was the Supervising Producer brought on under Executive Producer David
Moessinger when "Walker, Texas Ranger" was first being produced for CBS.  I
left in fairly short order to do B5, which had already been commissioned
prior to doing Walker, but David asked for some help, and I never decline a
friend.  Unfortunately, the studio was Cannon TV, which is not exactly known
for its sterling rep, so after a while I was driven mad and ran screaming out
into the night.  "WTR" was eventually transferred to a different, better
studio.
