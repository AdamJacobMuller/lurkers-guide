<PRE>"Since Warner Brothers does not seem to have an understanding of what they
have on their hands,   (Don't they realize the cash potential they have?!)
Would you object to us, (loyal following) writing to them (Snail or E-Mail)
and expressing more promotions or recognition be given the show?   If so, can
you publish the CEO's name and address here? (preferably, E-Mail address)"

That would be Robert Daly, at WB in New York; don't have his address at hand.
