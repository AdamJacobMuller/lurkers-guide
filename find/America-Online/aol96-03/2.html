<PRE>{I read somewhere that Lyta is deaf.}

No, the novelist didn't blow it, Joe blew it, because in proofreading the
manuscript, Joe missed that line somehow, and didn't catch it.  It's my job
to catch these things.  (Just spent a whole week going over the A-Z of
Babylon 5 coming out from Boxtree Books in the UK to keep it as accurate as
possible.)
