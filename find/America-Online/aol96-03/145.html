<PRE>Well, I suppose he could've said six-point-one kilometers (or whatever the
figure would be, I'm too tired and it's too late in the evening to do the
math), but it'd kinda spoil the flow of the sentence; and if it's total
length works out to five miles, give or take a bit, that seems the way to go.
