<PRE>No, the whole point of a mystery done *right* is that some folks won't ever
figure it out, a majority of them will have some vague ideas, and some *will*
figure it out.  That's the only outcome -- a bell-shaped curve -- if you're
playing fair with the audience.  The clues have to be out there, and if they
are, some will notice.  If nobody gets it, you didn't play fair.  This was
one of the lessons I learned working on MURDER, SHE WROTE.
