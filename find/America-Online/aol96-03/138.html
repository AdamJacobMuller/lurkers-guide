<PRE>The Ranger colony was financially supported by the Minbari; the Drazi allowed
them to use one of their colony worlds as a base.

If humans are special, and in some measure we are or we wouldn't be in the
story, I should think it's more for what we *do* than what we *are*.  There
is something very unique about us which comes in handily in the series.
Delenn's already pointed this out.
