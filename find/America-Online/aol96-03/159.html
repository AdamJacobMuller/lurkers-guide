<PRE>Thanks.  The elements you cite are the reasons why it took us 5 years to get
this thing on the air; it's something a bit different, for the US at least.
We could've sold it a lot faster, and easier, if we'd taken some different
approaches -- dumbed it down a little, dropped the ongoing story, made it a
bit less ambitious -- but then it wouldn't be the story I wanted to tell.

And yes, the bits and pieces add up, and gain further weight by seeing how
they relate to different parts of the story.  It's a very careful, elegant
little dance which I think will be seen even more clearly once we go to daily
syndication.
