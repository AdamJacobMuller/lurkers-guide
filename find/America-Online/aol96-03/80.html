<H2>Name that tune</H2>

<PRE>I listen to just about every kind of music there is, except for hard country
music.  It just grates; not to say it's bad, lots of folks like it, it just
gets my teeth grinding like tectonic plates.  (The closest I get is bluegrass
and folk, with the Red Clay Ramblers being a favorite there.)

When I work, I tend to listen to different things as the mood strikes me.
Everything from rock to jazz to big band to "new age" to classical to Irish
music to Japanese music to Australian aboriginal music to Gregorian
chants...you name it.  I was heavily into Japanese KODO music for a while,
but because I was playing it all the time I kinda got KODO'd out after a
while.

Among the stuff that turns up most often on the stereo while I'm working
these days: Meatloaf, Slade, Enya, Alice Cooper, Melissa Etheridge, Sarah
MacLachlan, Benny Goodman, Artie Shaw, Red Clay Ramblers.  I'll probably
cycle through into more orchestral/instrumental stuff soon.
