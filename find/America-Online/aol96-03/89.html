<H2>Cancellation of B5!?</H2>

<PRE>This happens every season.  People with too much free time on their hands
start posting rumors long before anything has even been *discussed*.  This
happened after the pilot ("I just heard from a VERY reliable source that it's
never gonna make it to series") after the first season ("a guy I know at WB
says the first season was just a fluke, they got pressured, there won't be a
second season"), after the second....

Nothing is ever decided on these things until the execs meet to go over it,
and that won't happen until late April/early May.  Anyone who says he's heard
anything definitive before then is simply full of it.
