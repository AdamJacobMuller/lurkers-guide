<PRE>The story just kinda shifted away from that for a while; I try not to stay
too long with any one thread.  They sorta come in waves; as with this season,
we emphasized Earth stuff for the first 11 or so episodes; then we slide back
into the Centauri stuff, then the Minbari, then the Narn.  Aspects of the
show rise and fall in prominence as needed for the story.  We'll get back to
the pilots in the fullness of time.
