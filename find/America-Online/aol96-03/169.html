<PRE>It's always chancy on every show as you come to renewal time; the added
problem here is that the marketplace is fast running out of slots for
syndicated shows due to the committed time slots for WBN, UPN, Fox and
others.  So there are a lot of factors coming at us from all sides, which
didn't exist when we first went on the air, but we remain cautiously
optimistic.
