<H2>B5 Cast in the UK</H2>
96-03-21 03:31:24
<PRE>I don't think the overseas audience numbers will overly affect the decision
either way; studios tend to look at domestic as the primary market, and
everything else as ancillary, despite the fact that we are now a global
electronic community.

I think a few of the cast will hang about the UK for a bit while they're over
for the cons; in general, many of our cast and crew hang out together and do
things while on vacation...they like each other, and getting them apart is
tough.
