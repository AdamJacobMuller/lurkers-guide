<PRE>Thanks.  The Inquisitor was a great episode to write, and Wayne did a killer
job with it (so to speak).  That one episode has received more mail than most
others, particularly from those in the religious community, as well as at
universities, crisis centers, you name it.  Something there seemed to strike
a chord.

It's easy in an SF show to cut to the EFX and let it rock; to me, the
challenge is what's shown in those scenes: two people, locked in a room, no
(or few) EFX, no car chases, not even much of a set...with explosions of
dialogue and character.  Ah loves it.
