<PRE>No, I've never had writer's block.  (I hate saying that; it's like saying out
loud at the top of the 9th inning that you've got a no-hitter going...the
universe loves to trip you up.)

I think it comes from being a generalist; if I don't have a script at hand to
think about, I flip over to writing a short story, a novel, an article,
something else.  Also, I never sit down to write out a scene or a section
until I've "seen" it in my head so many times that it's practically
transcription at that point.
