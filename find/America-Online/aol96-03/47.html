<PRE>Nope, still don't buy it.  How many versions have we seen of names in Vietnam
or China in English?  Look at an atlas for China in the 1960s, and now.
Notice that now X is used where once Ch was used.  (Chou becomes Xiou.)
Technically, my name is pronounced strachinski, but it's got a czy in the
middle of it.  

There's also a difference between transLATION and transLITERATION.  The
latter is often less accurate than the former.

You may choose to take any linguistic position you choose; however, the
language as it is used does not reconcile with that stance.
