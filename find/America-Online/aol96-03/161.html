<PRE>If they're the music clips off Franke's BBS, as far as I know that's fine,
because they were made available as samples as part of his license.  Other
sound clips...I can't endorse it, because past I think 20 seconds you run
into legal problems.  (Actually, it's not within my authority to "endorse"
much of anything, it's WB's copyright, I can only offer suggestions or
guidance.)
