<PRE>Thanks.  The job of the show is to ask questions and pose scenarios for
discussion, while at the same time entertaining, which is our primary
responsibility.  

I wouldn't say there's any one dominant area here, whether Kabalistic or
strictly Judaeo/Christian or otherwise...it's a hodgepodge of elements.  You
can find historical, religious, social and political echoes to a lot of
things.  In the area you mentioned, there's bits and pieces of the two areas
you singled out, plus buddhism, moslemism, zoroastrianism, Zen, catholicism,
you name it, because it helps to create an authentic feel to the alien
cultures and other aspects of the show.  Similarly, there are aspects of WW
2, WW 1, Korea, Vietnam, JFK...I try to grab from lots of different areas so
that it avoids being about The One Thing and becomes a synthesis that is
about *us* in all our various permutations.
