<PRE>"What period of history interests you the most?"

All of them, really, for different reasons.  The Middle Ages, the Victorian
period, the Renaissance, pre- and post-numerical wars and a time in which we
didn't have to number them...the present, the cruellest half of the cruellest
century...right down to the earliest civilizations.  We can learn something
from all of them.
