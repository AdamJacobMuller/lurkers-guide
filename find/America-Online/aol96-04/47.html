<PRE>The cold, hard and rather ruthless answer is...if you're not sure, if it's
just something you're kinda thinking about...don't do it.

The only ones who have a chance of making it as writers are those who can't
*not* write.  

"I am trying to find out what I can do with my life and writing sound like
fun."  It's not fun, as you mean it.  It's agony.  It's the hardest thing I
do.  It takes *years* of work, every single day, day in and day out, before
you get any good at it at all.  It takes suffering and pain and paying your
dues and fighting every single day first to prove you have talen to yourself,
then to prove it to others, then to finally begin making a living at it.
It's not a case of, "Well, look over there, *that* looks interesting, maybe
I'll do that."

Either being a writer means everything to you, or it doesn't.  If it doesn't,
you shouldn't do it.  It's not a question of knowing "what you want to do."
You *know* it.  It's just a matter of the will and strength required to *do*
it.

Unless that describes you...try something else.
