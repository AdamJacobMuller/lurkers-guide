<PRE>1.  What gave you the idea to create a show with a time line?

I wanted to do a saga; sagas take time to tell.  The Lensman books, the
Foundation books, Dune, others...they can take from a few years to hundreds
of years to tell.  (I love "A Canticle for Liebowitz," which compresses an
amazing timeline into one volume.)  Doing decades worth of story would be
impossible for TV's format, but a one-to-one year-to-season structure was
do-able.

2.  What were some of your first ideas for this series?

I don't quite understand the question.

3. How good of a chance does B5 have for being renewed?

50/50.

4. How is Harlan Ellison doing?

Much, much better.
