<PRE>No, the Triluminaries are simply not that important.  This isn't a story
about a mcguffin, a thing that has to be acquired or protected or regained;
also isn't a quest story.  If you look at any work of an epic, mythic or
saga-based construction, certain elements are universal.  Those themes show
up in all such sagas...if you look for any kind of real story correlation
between B5 and LoTR you won't find them.  They're not in any way parallels.
