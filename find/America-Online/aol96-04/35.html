<PRE>She already knew that civil war had broken out between EA ships and forces,
and that B5 had already faced one takeover bid, and that whether or not it
happened today or the next day, it was definitely coming.  That was
unmistakeable.  Also, bear in mind that Lennier stayed behind.  She would
have checked in with him en route and found out what was going on, or picked
up the radio broadcasts of the battle in progress.  I could've shown this,
but that would''ve blown the surprise of her arrival.
