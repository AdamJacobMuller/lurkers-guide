<PRE>"I would round up all the destroyed EA/centauri/narin hulls/ships I could
find.(Especially the burned out Agrippa) to intimidate others who come with
hostile intent.  Also it would serve as a parts depot."

What's there are burned, blackened husks, which you do NOT want floating
around as they become hideous dangers to navigation, and the "spare parts"
would eventually start banging into your station, hitting incoming ships and
starfuries.  What can be salvaged, has been.

"I would construtively use my communication command athourity to send letters
to the families of the dead."

EA has cut off access to Earth; they don't want Sheridan getting information
from back home, or relaying instructions to forces there.

"I would rig the jump gate to explode on my command."

Good idea; cut off the only means of escape for the quarter million people
there who don't have jump capable ships.  You won't stop an invasion by
hostile ships which can make their own jump points, you just end up killing
all your civilians.

"Make a deal with Drall on the defences, and learn of all his capabilities
also the Minbari's."

This is already in process, as has been established.

"Arrange an accident to happen to one of the shadow creatures on board and
get it to Dr. Franklin or Drall."

You have to find them first.

"Start a propagada campaign against Clark."

Better to tell the truth.  And, again, home-communications are down.

"Unite the renegade ships and offer a home to the missing Narin ship."

This is an obvious step already in process.

"Have the Minbari make a clone of Morden."

They don't have that technology.

"Start a spy network."

They're doing all they can to get info.

"Start propaganda working the non-aligned worlds."

See above.

"Get some answers from Kosh or kill him(information is everything)."

Yessir, that'll work out great.  The vorlons are important to winning this;
let's torture or kill their ambassador, REAL good idea.

"Have Lyta scan all the crew members for spyes and loyalties."

When you become obsessed with the enemy, you become the enemy.  This would be
a Bad Thing.

"Move the minbari ships out of sight(behind the planet)."

Another good idea; let's put them where they have to come all the way around
the planet, by which time B5 is a burned cinder.

"Start gathering intelegence on the shadows ships.  How many, were are they
made, how long to make"

Where would you get that information?  The only real source is on Z'ha'dum.

Basically, everything that can be done, *is* being done.  But people have to
have some moments to live, or there's nothing worth fighting for.  And
sometimes a relationship can remind us what we're fighting for.
