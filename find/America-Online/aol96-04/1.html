<PRE>{What episode would be best to bring new peoplein to watch the show?}

I strongly suggest you try this week's episode, "Severed Dreams."  I showed
it at a small con/fan gathering here in LA on Saturday, before the uplink,
and there were several folks there who hadn't seen or been moved to check out
B5...and by the time it was over, they'd turned around.
