<PRE>Thanks.  As far as visual EFX, animators and visual artists are
concerned...it's a world apart, one I barely understand.  I don't know what's
really required or designed to hep succeed...though I suspect the ability to
converse freely with squirrels is partly involved.  I couldn't advise you on
this and have that advice mean much of anything, I'm afraid.

For the rest, I can only offer my thanks.
