     As for keeping a record...I try, if spottily.  Oddly enough, the very
best record of this process exists in the multi-megabytes that have been
exchanged here, on GEnie and elsewhere.  It's something of a living
chronology.  I try to take photos on the set (when I remember), and I'm
keeping 1 copy of each day's dailies, instead of recycling the tapes.
