<H2>   What makes a good story?</H2>
<P>
     A lot of our episodes are constructed to work as mirrors; you see what
you put into it.  "Believers" has been interpreted as pro-religion. anti-
religion, and religion-neutral..."Quality" has been interpreted. as you note,
as pro-capital punishment, and anti-capital punishment.  We do, as you say,
much prefer to leave the decision on what things mean to the viewer to hash
out.
<P>
     A good story should provoke discussion, debate, argument...and the
occasional bar fight.

     One lovely thing about "Signs and Portents," which you picked up on. is
something I like to play with; implying one thing while saying the opposite.
Look at all the shadow's main representative, Morden, does: he asks people
what they want; he gets tossed out of Delenn's quarters; he is pleasant in his
demeanor at all times, never yells, always smiles, and is courteous; he takes
an action which saves one of our main characters. Londo, from disgrace and
resignation, and helps in the process of scragging the bad guys in the
episode.

     And yet everyone walks away thinking that the shadows are bad.  Which was
of course the intent...by the way in which they did "good."
<P>
     Kosh prevents humanity from achieving immortality, scares the hell out of
Talia, never gives anyone a straight answer, doesn't seem to mind it if people
fear him...and we walk away with the presumption that he is good. by virtue of
the way in which he did things that were "bad."
<P>
     In "The Quality of Mercy," I play a similar subtle game; the first time
you hear about the alien device, you're told that it takes the life force from
one person, killing them in the process, and gives it to someone suffering a
terminal disease to restore them.  And everybody goes "yuck, that's awful."
But that is *exactly* what happens at the end, and the general reaction is,
"That's good."
<P>
     This is something I do a lot in my scripts, which I don't generally see a
lot of other people doing.  You *really* have to construct the script very
carefully to pull something like this off...a little game between me and the
audience.
<P><HR><P>
     If you look at my scripts, you'll find that generally I write very tight,
I don't leave a lot of threads hanging as a rule.  Same with the planned
series.  No important threads will be left hanging by the end of it all.  And
generally any really significant thread will be wrapped within a year of being
introduced.
