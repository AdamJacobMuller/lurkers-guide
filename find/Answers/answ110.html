<H2>   Where do psi-corps ratings come from?  What are their legal</H2>
        restrictions?
<P>
     Psi Corps ratings are assigned from within the Academy, based on test
results and personal interviews/training.  Restrictions: NO unauthorized scans
-- you need the permission of the person, tacit permission, or written
permission of next of kin -- and no "dipping," going into other areas not
relevant to the current scan.  In criminal cases, psi's may not scan
defendants during a trial or before to determine guilt or innocence, as this
violates the right of due process.  After a conviction, a psi may be called
upon to function in various capactities (which will be seen in "The Quality of
Mercy").  A psi *may* scan the victim of a crime unable to remember details of
an attack, but that information must be backed up by physical evidence, or it
is inadmissible.

     The number of psi's in each category, from 1-12, gets rarer as you get
higher.  Lots of folks have a minimal tendency, very few have any real talent.

     A Psi-rating comes through training and examination of a person's skills
over time.  Ivanova's mother never went through the full sequence to get
rated.  (Although they generally don't bother with P1s through P2s, so she was
at least a P3 or above, in terms of raw ability.)  A psi rating isn't
hereditary.

     No, the accused cannot ask for a psi to validate his or her innocence;
the trial can ONLY proceed on the basis of evidence.  This is to prevent
abuse, trials where a Psi looks at you and determines your guilt. When a life
is at stake, you can't risk the possibility of some hidden agenda on the part
of the telepath.  You'd have to use a telepath to verify the first telepath's
scan, and on and on.  Best simply to exclude them from that aspect of the law.

     We're going to be doing a lot on the Psi Corps toward the middle of the
series, btw.  There's quite a bit in D.C. Fontana's new story, "Legacies," and
in a script I just finished, "Mind War."  The more I play around with the
notion of legalized, licensed telepaths, the more room there is for all kinds
of intrigue.

     As Walter says in "Mind War," about rogue telepaths, "Only Psi Cops are
qualified to bring them down, so we're afforded greater...latitude."  (That's
a paraphrase from memory.)
