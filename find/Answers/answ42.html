     Once the decision was made to make her definitely female, that led us to
modify the makeup.  Also, the original make up was done with very little lead
time, and some things we liked, some things we didn't.   It's now sleeker.
more attractive, and easier to apply and take off.

     Since we only really got a good look at one Minbari, it's kind of a moot
point.  The new lines are generally consistent throughout Minbari.

     We're also modifying the prosthetics a bit.  Again, because Delenn is
definitely female, we can use a little less in the way of heavy overlays on
the head and face to convey ile keeping the desired androgynous look.  This
lets us get the same basic image, but make a lighter and more easily applied
mask that will allow Mira greater degrees of comfort and free her up to act
without being hampered in any way.
