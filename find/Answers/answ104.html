<H2>   What is the rank system on B5 based on?</H2>
<P>
     On the theory that some of the militaries have blended, the system of
ranks is kind of a cross between the navy and the air force (at least the ones
with which our characters will have any interaction).
<P><HR><P>
     All Earthforce uniforms in this division are blue; EA marines are
olive/brown; security and other NCO areas get grey.  Within those areas, it's
further subdivided, and is distinguishable by the horizontal bars below the EA
insignia.  Gold is command; silver is for command staff.  (Ivanova, being in
between, has a divided bar, half gold and half silver.)  Red is medical, green
is security.  Yellow is for science division.  The rank bars are on the
shoulder.

     Sinclair and other officers are pure EA military, so they get the EA pins
on the chest.  (Also the techs wear them in the dome, and others in charge of
various divisions.)  Security is under the jurisdiction of EA, but are a
separate component, staffed under B5 financing.  These, and medical, and
scientific and environmental and other areas have their own symbol, which is
worn on their chest and shoulder.  You can tell who works for EA because they
have the EA also on their shoulder, whereas those who are employed directly by
B5 have the B5 symbol on their shoulder.
<P>
     The patches connote specialization: command is a starburst, lines that
radiate into every area; security is a gunsight/targeting symbol; medical is a
stylized medicine symbol, and so on.
<P>
     Sinclair and Ivanova wear their officer's bars on their epaulets; not the
triangular part per se, but the bars at the very far end of the epaulet, below
the triangles.
