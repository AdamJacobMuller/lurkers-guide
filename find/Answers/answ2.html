<P>
This document contains:
  * Extractions from the more-or-less complete GEnie/Usenet/CIS JMS archives.
  * An organized set of information & answers to questions, paraphrased here.
  * Fun tidbits of useful and useless information you may have missed.
  * Answers to questions you might have, so look in the FAQ and in here first!
  * Original typos and anachronisms.  These are direct quotes, you see!
  * Some lead-ins from quotes may be confusing based on questions asked.
  * Minor spoilers (more like tidbits) for present and future episoded.
  * Keywords to help you find a subject.  Search for an important word
    (singular, not plural, and lowercase) preceeded by the ~ mark.
    Examples :   ~delenn   ~g'kar   ~twin-peaks
  * An index of keywords can be found at the end of the document.
  * An update -- many additions, some deletions -- of the 5/14/94 version.
    (most episode-specific stuff is gone; see the guide pages.)

|    Changes: Took out much episode-specific stuff (better off in the guide
|    pages) and obsolete information, and added new information.  Some general
|    information on season 2 exists, though season 1 is still the main topic.
