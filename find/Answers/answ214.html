<H2>   How about laserdiscs?</H2>
<P>
     I'm led to understand that videotapes of B5 will be out sometime around
the Fall or so, from first season.  There will eventually be laserdisks, and
the best part of *that* is that they'll be in the original letterbox format in
which the show is actually filmed.
<P>
     In fact, in preparation for that, we've begun the process of transferring
the videotape CGI effects to film, in correct aspect ratio to match the
original live-action film.  As we finish, this will all have to be
quality-controlled, so though it's a burden, I've volunteered to get the first
set of widescreen tapes so that I can screen them prior to final transfer to
disk.
