     Disagreement: the coolest show ever made is THE PRISONER.  I hope to
capture a little of the flavor of that show, mainly by playing a little with
surrealism, what's real and what's not...but it'll pale beside that show. THE
PRISONER, for me, is the perfect television program.  I've never really seen
its equal.
