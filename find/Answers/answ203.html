<H2>   Are you going to use flashbacks to help tell the story?</H2>
<P>
     Mike: we're not going to see a lot of Sinclair in the past, only what is
necessary to understand the present...and there are going to be
transformations, but I prefer to see my transformations take place in the
present, pointing toward the future, than in flashback.
<P>
     The difference, I suppose, is that in many shows, characters arrive at
Point X in a series at the very beginning, and stay there for the duration.
and we are sometimes shown what made them that way.  In B5, what I'm trying
for is to take a certain set of characters, and move them all toward
substantive changes in their lives, their characters, their beliefs and their
allegiances.  Just about everyone on B5 is running to, or away from something.
I don't want that simply as backdrop, I want that something to *catch up with
them*.  That, to me, is where the fun starts.
