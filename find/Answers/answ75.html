<H2>   How do starfuries launch?</H2>
<P>
     The bay is pressurized, with drop doors beneath each fighter.  A ramp
extends to the fighters individually, bringing on pilots.  The bays are
depressurized as the pilots (in flight suits) prepare.  Then the drop doors
open, the fighters pivot to nose-down position, and launch.

     The fighters are in regular configuration when the pilot boards.   Then
the drop doors open, the ship tilts down on a massive pair of arms, and then
they're released, the centrifugal force of the station sending them out the
drop doors.

     The starfury fighter is launched by a drop straight out, nose pointed
"downward," toward space.  Upon release, it flies pretty much straight out.
still containing some of the momentum from the rotation, so it would appear to
be going straight away from the station because its position in relation to
the station, like a geosynchronous satellite, is still more or less correct.
Shortly after getting out of the bay, the fighters fire up their engines.
which lets them take any angle or direction they choose.  So they can very
quickly head away on any trajectory.

     There is nothing wrong with the launch sequence.  It causes them to move
directly away from the station, on a slight spiral, facing out to the stars
from the pilot's POV.  Whether or not it looks funky has little to do with
whether or not this is the most efficient means of doing this.  I think it's
kind of funky that the space shuttle flies upside down while in orbit, its
cargo bay facing down toward Earth, but that's the way it's done, and there
are good reasons for it.  We sat down for a very long time with a bunch of
designers and techies who know physics and know math and know flight dynamics.
we ran computer models, and the physics are right.
