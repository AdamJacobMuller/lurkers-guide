     Quick sketch of Ivanova: Russian, pessimistic, wry, very sharp.  She
isn't in "Believers" because there was a one-week overlap with a prior
committment on a film project, which we accommodated. --
<P>
     Being of Byelorussian descent, I've always wanted to write for an ethnic
Russian character.  Not someone with an accent, any more than I have an accent
even though I have a last name with 10,000 consonants and no vowels. There's a
wry and formal and stiff-necked and sometimes very passionate streak that runs
through the Russian spirit, and a certain rough-hewn mysticism, a sense of
absolute fatality and doom punctuated by moments of great belief in humanity.
It's a mix of traits you don't much see in American television.
<P>
     Which is why the new second in command is Lieutenant Commander Susan
Ivanova, who will be played by Claudia Christian, a fantastic and very strong
performer who just knocked us out of the room.  Very much a commanding
presence, a little quirky when she wants to be, a shade on the pessimistic
side.
<P>
     Having come out of an Eastern European background, I've long lamented the
stereotyped roles usually written for that kind of character, and look forward
to drawing upon the real thing for her character.
<P><HR><P>
     Claudia has settled nicely into the role, with this great edge to her
performance.  Pessimistic, fatalistic, occasionally sarcastic, but in a funny
way...that can turn right around and tear your heart out.
<P><HR><P>
     I like Ivanova as well; she's got a very sly, very *sharp* intelligence
going there.  She can deadpan you and whap you upside the head with a comment
delivered almost as an aside, or an afterthought. It's the difference between
wit and humor.  She doesn't tell jokes, but she's got a great sense of wit.
<P><HR><P>
     Here's what I find curious (not necessarily in direct response to
anything you said, but in general on this topic)...is that when Ivanova makes
her remark to Garibaldi about snapping his hands off at the wrists, many
people have assumed that she was insulting him, berating him, being bitchy.
truly disliking and threatening him.
<P>
     But the same words, put in the mouth of another male, wouldn't have drawn
that reaction, and would've been classified under, "kidding around" or affable
sarcasm.
<P>
     Which is exactly what it is in this case.  In this place and this time.
they're comfortable enough to mess with each other without it being taken
seriously (among these characters, that is).  There are times they kinda like
to phuque with each other a bit, just for the hell of it, as comrades will
sometimes do.  ("Babylon Squared" has a great example of Sinclair and
Garibaldi messing with Ivanova.)
<P><HR><P>
     There's a Billy Joel song, where one particular lyric (and I'm quoting
from memory) says, "You still have a pain inside you / That you carry with a
certain pride / It's the only part / Of a broken heart / You could ever save."
That's Ivanova.
<P>
     She's had her heart stomped on a lot.  And she's been holding it in. Even
with her father's death, she sucked in the pain, fought back the tears. There
is one episode, which will be right at the end of the year, where she finds
she can't run from her pain anymore...can't run from the tears...and deals
with them in a scene that's very moving and absolutely brings tears to the
eyes.
<P><HR><P>
     Kwicker, Ivanova has *not* said stuff about being Russian "every other
episode."  I made the error of having her say it twice in the two-parter, now
everybody's seeing it as a big thing.  It was mentined in Soul Hunter.
Survivors, and Voice, and insofar as I know, that's it.  (I'll allow for the
possibility of one more, even though I don't recall any others.)  I don't
think that 3-4 episodes in a 22 episode season quite qualifies as "every other
episode."
<P><HR><P>
     The main reason for the Lt. Cmdr. distinction in most circumstances is
because otherwise you've got two Commanders on deck, and it helps to keep
distinct which you're addressing. But we have some different ideas in mind for
year two.
<P><HR><P>
     And yes, Ivanova was born on Earth, in the Russian Consortium, though she
was educated in large measure overseas.
