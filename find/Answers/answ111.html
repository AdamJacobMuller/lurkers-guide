     There are more aliens than just the 5 major groups.  In addition to them.
there's *bunches* of oththe classification of the League of Non-Aligned
Worlds.  The Big Five constitute what is in essence the Security Counsel.
while the rest are the General Assembly.  We will see these groups
participating in that capacity in "Midnight."

     It was Minbari Federation, Centauri Republic, Narn Regime, Vorlon Empire
and Earth Alliance, for anyone keeping track.  And yes, most all of them have
some other alien species within their sphere of direct influence.

     Most of the non-aligned worlds have a less technologically advanced
society, but mainly what constitutes membership in the Big 5 is the size of
the government in question.  If it's just one planet and maybe a sister world
or two, that's not enough to qualify.

     The Babylon 5 Advisory Council and the League of Non-Aligned Worlds
functions in much the same fashion as the Security Council and the General
Assembly in the U.N.  The smaller worlds and alliances can't weild as much
power as any of the Big Five.  Together, they as a group get a vote equal to
one of the Big Five; they can deputize one of their number to speak for them
and cast that vote, which can often break ties or create ties.  It is not a
terribly equitible situation, but it was the only workable solution that would
be accepted by the other Ambassadors.  We'll see them chafing at this in
"Deathwalker."
