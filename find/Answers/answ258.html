     You wanna hear really dopey?  Of all the things that can bug you --
literally, in this case -- it's always the small ones that get under your
skin.  The goofy ones.
<P>
     Take crickets for instance.

     Crickets.  Cute little critters, welcoming the twilight, equipped with
top hat and umbrella to usher Pinnochio into his long-sought humanity....
Crickets.
<P>
     Ah hates crickets.

     A cricket family -- at least one that we know of -- moved into a corner
of one of our sets.  The medlab, to be precise.  Now, when we're moving things
around, building stuff, moving stuff, it's silent, as a cricket will generally
be when made nervous.  But make it all nice and quiet -- as you would do for.
say, filming -- and he becomes downright rambunctious.  And sure enough, there
is is, deep in the audio background on a few shots.  Oh, we can hide the audio
easily enough...but Getting The Cricket has become something of a cause around
here.

     We absolutely cannot find him.  I stood back there for ten minutes, eyes
closed, trying to triangulate and draw a bead on the little sucker.   We've
tried exterminators, smoke, nitrogen, assassins and psychics; we've tried
scaring him and coaxing him, to no avail.  He is as invisible as god but with
a MUCH louder voice.
<P>
     You ever fire up a daily to hear, at the top of the take, the off screen
director saying, as fast as he can, "Okaythecricket'ssilent,ACTION!"
<P>
     Like I said...not really a problem, just one of those little things that
niggle at you when there's nothing else going on.  So we're going to wait him
out.
<P>
     Anybody know offhand the lifespan of your average cricket...?
