<H2>   Why is Babylon 5 orbiting a planet, instead of being on a planet?</H2>
<P>
     Many of the huge transports that'll be coming to B5 were never meant to
operate within an atmosphere, they're strictly deep range starships, to which
you transfer using atmosphere-capable shuttles.  We're not talking little
flits, we're talking about ships that can be as big as a mile across. Dropping
something that huge down into the gravity well of a planet is just unworkable.
If you want something that can handle lots of big ships, it *has* to be in
space...as in a station.
<P>
     You could park a big ship near a planet, and use lots of shuttles to
unload it down to the planet (gravity well, heavy cargo, lots of fuel, lots of
time, more accidents), then haul it right back *up* again when it's sold or
transferred...or you could build a station in zero G where your big transport
just parks alongside, loads or unloads its cargo in zero gravity, and transfer
it where needed.
<P>
     And the atmosphere of the planet is no longer breathable.

     Yes, the nearby planet will eventually figure into the storyline.  No, I
cannot currently tell you how.

     The world B5 orbits is Epsilon 3.
