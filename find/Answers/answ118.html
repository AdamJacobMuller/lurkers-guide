<H2>   How about drugs?  Has marijuana been legalized?</H2>

     It's never come up, and probably never will, but in terms of backstory.
yes, it was legalized quite some time ago.  There are only a certain number of
drugs not allowed on B5; those which would lead to destructive, violent
behavior that would disrupt the station, and Dust, about which you won't be
hearing for a while.

     Near as I can figure, all grass makes you want to do is sit around eating
pizza and watching old Lucy reruns....
