     We do tend to try and stay open to gender stuff; usually there's a reason
why someone is male or female, so it's cast that way.  But as an example...in
"Quality of Mercy," the role as originally written was for a father/daughter
combination.  In the process of casting, we thought, why not mother/daughter?
So that's how it ended up.  In "Points of Departure," we have one of your
requests already taken care of...a part of a war cruiser commander who
could've been male or female...cast female.
