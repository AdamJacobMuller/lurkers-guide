     Spent a very, very, very long day today in editing...not out of any
problems, but because of the *astonishing* amount of detail we're putting into
"And the Sky Full of Stars."  Leaving out all the live-action shots, there are
25 CGI shots in one and a half minutes in one sequence alone.   (By way of
comparison, there were 55 or so in the full two hour pilot for B5.) So we go
frame by frame, making sure that everything meshes properly, through some
pretty intense logistics.  You'll understand when you see it.

     I've never seen the like of this particular episode before.  It's a real
gem.
