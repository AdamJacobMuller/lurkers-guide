     The one thing that I'd like to point out is that Warner/PTEN isn't in the
programming business.  This isn't a normal part of their PR strategy. The only
reason they have done this at all -- the B5 computer promo -- is in
recognition of the online support here and elsewhere.  They have had to
contract out for this, and because this isn't a proven (yet) strategy, could
only carve out so much for it.  No, not every platform is covered; doubtless
that will change with time.  But it's generally never done at ALL.  So I would
just temper the discussion with that reality.
