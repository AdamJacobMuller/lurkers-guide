<H2>   How does B5 manages to keep costs so low compared to other shows?</H2>
<P>
     On this whole "costs less = not as good" question, the one thing that
galls me is the knowledge, accumulated through 120+ produced TV episodes, that
30% *or more* of any show's budget is wasted.  It comes because you don't get
a script until maybe 3-4 days before you have to shoot, and everybody works
round the clock, ringing in double- and triple-overtime on EFX, costumes.
sets, you name it.  So items that should by all rights cost maybe $150,000 end
up costing you $300,000 or more.
<P>
     In B5, we're generally 3-5 scripts ahead of ourselves at any one moment.
Directors and crew get their scripts *weeks* before we have to shoot.  And
even earlier than that, because I know what's coming down the road for the
whole season, I can give someone literally *months* of advance warning on
major EFX, or set requirements.  As a result of all this, items that normally
cost $150,000 either cost exactly that, or we actually end up *saving* a
little money.
<P>
     A lot of television production is absolutely irresponsible.  That we are
penalized in the press for acting responsibly is something that I just can't
figure....

     One nice thing about the way we're doing this show is that we don't just
have to set up gags within an episode; we can set them up *weeks* ahead of
time, as long as the payoff is self-contained, but then when you see the
earlier shows, now you get more out of it.
