<H2>   How did you create so many great characters?</H2>
<P>
     In a way, I kinda took a shortcut...the kind of shortcut that helps you
make the characters more real.  I basically peeled off aspects of my own
background and divided it up among the characters.
<P>
     I have an Eastern European background; that brings with it a certain
amount of pessimism, a somewhat sardonic humor, and a view of life that is
somewhere between resignation and astonishment, and gave that to Ivanova.
<P>
     I was raised Catholic (though it wore off, I'm happy to report), so I
gave some of that to Sinclair, escalating it to Jesuit training; gave him some
of my fascination with history and religion and philosophy.  I've also lost a
lot of people over the years, and gave him some of the sadness that comes with
that.
<P>
     One of the things that has constantly gotten me in deep trouble is that
I'm basically a smartass; I always mouth off at *exactly* the wrong moment. So
this went right to Garibaldi. along with my basic atheism.
<P>
     The alien ambassadors are less personally based, since there have to be
some alien characteristics about them; a different culture that informs who
and what they are.  In those cases I kind of backtracked from what the species
was. and tried to choose as typical a representative of that as I could.

     "Then explain Kosh."
<P>
     Okay...you got me.

     It's impossible not to have the characters change to varying degrees once
you cast actors to play them.  Gradually, Mira's personality has grown into
Delenn, Andreas has added a lot to G'Kar, Garibaldi IS Doyle. and Boxleitner
is bringing a lot to Sheridan.  You get to hear the characters' voices more
the deeper you go, season-wise, and that's great.

     Re: Sinclair/Garibaldi/Ivanova basically liking each other; this will
tend to stay, for many reasons.  One of the things that grates on mhy nerves
about some dramatic TV is that they invent phony tensions and reasons for the
main characters to bitch at each other, that generally don't mean a lot.
Also, we see a lot of conflict in other shows, but not a whole lot of what
*friendship* means.  And loyalty.  These three are friends, as well as
co-officers; they will go to bat for one another, will if necessary die for
one another.  I find that a lovely emotion.  There are plenty of others who
argue with them, and plenty of other shows in which the main characters yell
at each other all the time; why not explore the other end of the spectrum?
<P>
     I will grant you that this is one of the more idosyncratic parts of the
show; I have always placed a very high premium on friendship...my friends know
that they can call me at midnight, and even if they're on the other side of
the country, or the planet, I'll be there on the first plane if they're in
trouble.  And I know I can do the same with them.  For some reason friendship,
and loyalty, have become kind of passe in TV, and movies, and many other
areas, as I think of it.  So for me, this becomes something worth
communicating.
<P>
     Bear in mind, though, that after this season, Sinclair goes elsewhere.
and suddenly there's a new dynamic introduced into the show, which no one is
entirely sure how to deal with.  It disrupts them, and that is for the good, I
think, as they try and work it out and decide whether or not they can trust
one another.
