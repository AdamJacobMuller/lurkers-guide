     I'll have to be a little circumspect here (damn it, you're doing it
again....).  The Narn Regime is not currently at war with the Centauri
Republic, which occuped the Narn homeworld for nearly a century before finally
being driven off by the Narn resistance.  Their resources depleted they are
not currently in a position to make war on anyone; being naturally rather
paranoid, and having just been more or less enslaved, they have a dread of
other races getting together and possibly harming them, as well as a hunger
for the technology that might protect them down the road (as Russia feared
invasion its Eastern Front after WW2).

     There's a rough alliance between the Earth Alliance and the Centauri.
since theirs was the first race we encountered.  (They told us at that time
that they were the biggest guys around, that they ran everything, that we were
a lost colony of theirs...which eventually was disproven by genetic
examination.  The rest of their claims were also BS.  They were trying to
impress the natives.)

     There's some movement toward making nice with the Minbari, but also a
GREAT deal of resistance, given the recent war.

     The Earth/Minbari war started with a Minbari first encounter (by us) that
went tragically wrong and resulted in a firefight, in which the leader of the
Grey Council was killed.

     The attack killed the Minbari leader, head of the Grey Council, Dukhat.
the most evolved and wise soul of all the Minbari.

     The only questions I can remember...the vorlons have never fought a war
with any other race.  (At least none has ever been recorded.)  And right now
in the Minbari race there's a big split that took place after the
Earth/Minbari war between the religious leaders and the military leaders.
which culminated with the suicide of the Minbari commander at the conclusion
of the war.  They've now arrived at an uneasy truce, but with time, who knows?

     The minbari warrior caste leader who committed suicide rather than issue
the surrender command was Sineval.

than not.  They *are* a powerful group, and it wouldn't serve to ignore them.
We courted them for 10 years for a first contact...and now we're stuck with
them.
<P><HR><P>
     The Earth/Minbari war lasted almost five years.  The terms of surrender
were conditional; there was to be no reparation.  It was simply a cessation of
hostilities.  It was not a clear-cut issue of being beaten or doing the
beating; it just stopped...which left a lot of people feeling about the same
way some did after Vietnam.  Peace with honor?  Maybe, maybe not.
