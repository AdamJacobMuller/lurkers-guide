     Funny aside...on Friday, my accountant and his 10 year old son came by
the set for a tour.  His son was wog-boggled by everything.  At one point in
the filming, Michael O'Hare came over and struck up a conversation with the
kid.  The kid asked what that thing is on the back of Sinclair's hand. "That's
my communications device," O'Hare said.  The kid looked chagrined, glanced
around, whispered to Michael to lean down, and explained -- to save Michael
further embarrassment in future -- that the communicator was on his *chest*.
<P>
     I would give my soul for a photograph of Michael's face at that moment.
