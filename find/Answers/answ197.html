        anonymous, unknown characters.  Will we see anybody get killed off
        that's not just a minor character?

     You'll get your wish...and you'll wish you hadn't....

     Matt: the most entertaining thing for a writer is creating a character;
the second most entertaining thing is killing off a character.  Believe me, as
you'll see in the Fight To The Death in the pilot, I have no problem dropping
a body.  And as far as I'm concerned, only 2 or 3 characters in this series
are indispensible...the rest are open to all kinds of interesting fates.

     The problem with episodic series is that, after a while, you know what
the parameters are.  You know THIS character won't ever be killed, and THAT
base has got to remain, and THIS can't change.  And you fall into a habit and
into regular expectations.  I *love* to blow up those sorts of expectations.
Find the one thing that NO ONE thinks you're ever going to do in your
show...and do it.  It keeps EVERYBODY on their toes.  If you can tune in and
never know for sure what's going to happen, knowing that everyone and
everything is fair game, it makes the tension in the show far more real.  The
reaction when Pilot/Jennifer Chase was killed off was astonishing...and when
the base was destroyed with her.  I was at a con when it was shown, and one
person finally broke the stunned silence and said, "Jesus, they're not kidding
around, this IS a war."  Which was exactly the right response.

     How this will affect B5...wait and see.
