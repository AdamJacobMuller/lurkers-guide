     As reward for the humor, here's what Kosh will *really* say, when he
utters the first words we hear.  He's on the Observation Dome, looking out
through the window as a ship passes overhead, the lights shining down at him
through a window.
<P>
     "Ahhh....beautiful."   Long beat as he looks around the place.  Then: "I
will miss this...when it is gone."
<P>
     And then he exits, as Garibaldi mutters to Ivanova, "I *really* hate it
when he does that."

     The scene was trimmed for time.  It may show up again later.
