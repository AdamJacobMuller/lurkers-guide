     Re: Non-humanoid...bear in mind, you still haven't seen what Kosh is
inside that suit...others, very non-humanoid, will make their appearances down
the road...and there's one race that has not yet been heard from, one shadow
government so secretive its existence is only whispered about, and when *they*
make their appearance, and you finally see what *they* look like...well, let's
just say that I've talked at some length with our EFX people, and it'll take
about 2 years to work out how to do this and make it credible.

     What you have to understand, though, is that if you're going to have a
character BE a character, alien or not, you've basically got two choices: put
a human actor in makeup of some kind or other. or you use puppets or
animatronics, and in general the technology to realize that still isn't enough
to make it really lifelike.

     Okay, but now, the only problem is...let's say we take your advice, and
build an alien around the design of an oyster.  Now we have Sinclair having a
converstion with an oyster.  Can you *imagine* the audience reaction?  Some
things sound nice in theory, but when you build it, and try to play it for
drama...it ends up very, very badly.

     On the other hand, the pak'ma'ra, which you'll get a good look at in
"Legacies," are *quite* different from earth critters.

     We were going to have a CGI creature in the bar at one point, but vetoed
it at the last minute.  So it's not there.  However, a CGI
character/alien/critter does play a substantive on-camera role in one episode
this season entitled "Grail."

     We've had other kinds of aliens, including the CGI creature in "Grail,"
and we're doing more non-humanoid stuff in year two. mixing prosthetics with
CGI.
