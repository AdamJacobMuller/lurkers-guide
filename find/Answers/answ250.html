<H2>   Are you exhausted from all this work?</H2>
<P>
     I am.  I'm exhausted all the time...running on 3-4 hours of sleep a
night, producing during the day, writing all night...but it *is* fun.   The
only hard part is that because of my close involvement in this show, and
creating the characters, and assigning the stories, and working with the
actors...I have Londo and G'Kar and Kosh and Garibaldi and all the rest
running around in my head and yelling at each other 24 hours a day, and
sometimes that can make you just a little nuts...you wanna tell them to shut
the hell up for five minutes...and then they look at you with this wounded
expression...you ever see a Narn sulk?  It's not a pretty sight.

     Yeah, easy for YOU to say, KAL...I've got Londo, Garibaldi, G'Kar, Kosh
and half the Psi-Corps running around inside my head and yelling at each other
24 hours a day...YOU try to sleep with all that racket.
<P>
     I either need to find a better neighborhood, or a worse one, I can't
decide....

     "AH, my GOOD, CLOSE FRIEND, GariBALdi --"

     That's it!  Everybody outta the pool......!
