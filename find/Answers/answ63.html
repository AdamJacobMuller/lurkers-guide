     Finally, having gone his separate ways with Caroline -- she wanted him to
leave his job, he wouldn't -- Sinclair renews a longstanding relationship with
Catherine Sakai, a role we are going to cast sometime fairly soon.
<P>
     Catherine works for an Earth Corp surveying asteroids and planets for
minerological exploitation, making sure they're uninhabited, and finding items
that might present the greatest possibility for profit.

     We've shot our first scenes between Sinclair and his new love interest.
Catherine Sakai (as played by Julia Nickson).  This is a very, very strong
character, and she brings a wonderful vibrancy to Sakai.   They have a unique
relationship that looks and sounds like a real relationship, with all its ups
and downs and dumb moments.  One way that I've reinforced this is that...well.
in the first episode in which they meet again (they were involved before).
just about every scene between them is lifted almost directly from personal
experience.
<P>
     And given some of the awkward, even painful conversations that take
place, it was very, *very* hard to watch this being rehearsed.  (Michael and
Julia worked over a weekend with the director to get the nuances just right.)
When it came time to shoot the scenes, much as I wanted to be on-set, I just
couldn't do it.  My heart just kept falling right down to my shoes.  I can't
wait for the first person to say "I don't buy this as a real relationship"
just so's I can whap him upside the head.  But I have a hunch that won't
happen.  It comes across as very real, and as a very vulnerable moment for
both characters.
<P>
     "Write what you know," they said.  Right.  How about I just take a power
drill and stick it in my ear...it'd be faster, less painful, and after a while
I might even come to like it....
<P><HR><P>
     Catherine Sakai is a surveyer.  She has her own business.  She has her
own ship.  In some episode, she has nothing whatsoever to do with the
commander, she's off doing her own business.  In "Mind War," as one example.
we see her for 30 seconds with the commander in the morning, with both going
off to their respective jobs, and that's it...the rest of the story she's in
is exclusively hers, concerning something she runs into while on a survey run.
<P><HR><P>
     Regarding Catherine Sakai...believe me, this ain't a consort kind of
relationship.  It will be monogamous, but difficult in many ways.  This has
been an on-again/off-again relationship between them for years, made up of
three parts passion and two parts teeth.  It will be a very fiery
relationship.  And this is a woman with her own business, her own ship, who
comes and goes as she wishes.  You have to understand that I love writing
strong female characters, and Catherine will be probably one of the strongest.
