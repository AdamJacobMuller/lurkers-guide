     Here's one little extra for you: only one person aboard Babylon 5 has any
idea of what a Vorlon is, inside that suit, and only one race has had dealings
with the Vorlons before.  Watch the reception at the end, and see if you
notice anything unusual in the way the various people respond to Kosh.
