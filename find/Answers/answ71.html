     The defense system for B5 consists of a system of moderate level
defensive grids, hull-mounted weaponry (which is generally concealed behind
large plates, which would be blown off with explosive bolts to reveal the
weapons beneath), and a small number of individual fighter craft stored in a
docking bay at the rear of the station.

     As for defense,  you'll see a full demonstration of this in the first
season; for now, let's just say that that smooth looking exterior is laced
with sections that can open and reveal all kinds of interesting things.
Imagine a five mile long Swiss Army knife....
