<H2>   Where in the galaxy is the station located?</H2>

     We're still in the process of drawing up a detailed starmap with the
distances from B5 to each of our major governments, but we're looking at
roughly 25 light years from Earth.

     We'll imply some of the geography in the series, but the interactive
computer program coming out soon has a map of the station, and shows where
what is in relation to everything else.
