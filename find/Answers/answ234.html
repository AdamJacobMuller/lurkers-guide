<H2>   Wanna be on Tee Vee?</H2>
<P>
     As for me...the TV camera doesn't like me, it just sorta slides over me
and adds 10 years to me.  Complicated by the fact that when I'm shoved in
front of a TeeVee camera, my head retracts like a turtle, my neck disappears.
and everything goes everywhere.  Harlan, on the other hand, is comfortable
before a camera.  The camera *loves* Harlan.
