<H2>   Why do the starfury fighters look like X-wings from Star Wars?</H2>
<P>
     When we did the research on how a fighter could best operate in zero
gravity, it seemed to require a four-wing axis with thrusters on every side.
We've thus taken every possible step to make them NOT look like x-wings.
particularly since there's no long, sleek forward section at *all*, it's a
snub-nose, and the wings don't move, plus they have the unusual thruster
combination.
