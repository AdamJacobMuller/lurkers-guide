     BTW, did I mention that DC is going to be doing a B5 comic?  And that one
of our own locals here on the net just may have a little something to do with
it?  And that Bill Mumy may write a bit for it, and Peter David, and me, and
some other nifty writers?

     I work directly with DC on the comics line.  I approve artwork. stories,
script and cover art.

     I'm trying to make the B5 novels and comics as much canon as I can.
Basically, they take place within B5 continuity, as episodes that might have
been.  The first four issues of the comic deal with issues that hit the
series, but from another point of view/location.  The novel uses B5 as
background of an event that makes sense within B5 continuity, and may be
referred to in future episodes (not as a requirement, but only as
background...no different than when you have to give background on any episode
of stuff that's happened in the past, like Ironheart's escape. for instance,
which we don't have to see/read about, but knowing is nice).

     I *really* don't want these to be just throwaways media-tie-ins.  I want
them to stand on their own as good work, *and* be part of our universe.

     Thankfully, I no longer require sleep, and have transcended to a higher
state of consciousness...ommmmmm....

     And yes, there is complete freedome to use Sinclair in the books since
he's not entirely gone from the storyline at all, and still will carry a part.

     The comics series is free to bop forward and backward in time, all over
the B5 universe, wherever the writer wants to take it.
