     Yeah, the more I delve into Londo's character, the more I find him
intriguing.  He mourns for the loss of his beloved Empire, and this makes him
vulnerable to some dangerous temptations.  There are a number of dark corners
in his personality...but at the same time, a vulnerability, a sadness.

     In the B5 story arc, Londo goes through some *major* changes, some good.
some tragic, some frightening.  He becomes a major player, but not in the way
he would ever have anticipated.

     Re: Londo as a romantic character...bless your heart.  You are the first
to have nailed it absolutely on the head.  If I had to write a description of
the character, I doubt I could have done any better than what you just wrote.
There are a *lot* of episodes that bring this out in him, including the next
one up, "Born to the Purple," which I suspect will end virtually all of the
hair jokes once and for all.

     Actually, no, Londo was not based on Brother Theodore, who I only
discovered some time later on Letterman.  But Harlan and Peter David mentioned
at the panel that Brother Theodore could make a swell brother for Londo in
some episode, so this is something I may consider....
