     Yes, we're trying to use real stars and constellations in our script
references, as well as indications of new ones that may have been discovered
in the 200 years between now and the time of B5.  (At one point, a
tech-runner's background is being discussed, and they mention that he ran
forbidden technology into the Vega and Proxima systems, for instance.)  Which
star is the one Babylon 5 orbits?  One that hasn't been discovered at this
point in time...but in about 50 years, it'll show up on the starcharts.  It's
a fairly small star, dwarfed and hidden by several nearby binaries that
overwhelm the spectrum visible from Earth.

     Yeah, that's the ticket....

     The sector of space was chosen for B5 because a) it's pretty much in
neutral territory, and b) of the neutral territory areas, this is the one that
seems to have nothing of value in it, so nobody will be interested in fighting
over what's there.  This may not necessariliy be true in the future.
