<H2>   What was the Centauri relationship to Earth?</H2>
<P>
     The Centauri never really got around to us.  They've been in a decline
for a long time; the Narn occupation was one of the last of their imperialist
rampages.  Now they're pulling back further and further.  And also as re:
Earth...space is big.  100 years ago, we weren't putting out any radio or
television or microwave transmissions; they can't check EVERY planet.  We got
overlooked for a long time by lots of different groups.

     While we were in an agrarian state, and an early industrial state, we a)
were of very little use, b) had little to offer, and c) came at a time when
the Centauri were starting to fall back into isolationism just a bit.  The
Narn had the misfortune to be strategically well located, had many resources
the Centauri wanted, and provided other advantages.  One doesn't just conquer
worlds helter-skelter; it takes time, money, effort and some blood to conquer
worlds.  You only choose those which offer you enough to make the process
worthwhile.  That simple.
