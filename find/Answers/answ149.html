     The CGI are definitely getting better.  Year One was more or less getting
used to the software and learning what was capable.  They've now gotten more
sophisticated in their use of the equipment, more artistic in some ways...and
the preliminary renderings I've seen for stuff in the beginning of year two is
*very* cool.  It has even more of a sense of mass, and weight, and solidity.

     We're re-doing *all* of our computer displays for next year, using some
nifty graphic designs.  Part of the problem is that the boys at Foundation
were doing the displays, and they were swamped doing our main CGI, so that
kinda fell by the wayside.  This year we've got someone who does ONLY our
computer screens with us in-house.

     Glad you liked the series font, btw; I picked it out me own self.   It's
Serpentine Medium, for anyone interested.
