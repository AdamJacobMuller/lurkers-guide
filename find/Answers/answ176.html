<H2>   What kind of impact do you want the show to have on viewers?</H2>
<P>
     The other day, a reporter asked me what I wanted to accomplish with
B5...and I remembered this commercial showing a viewer plastered against the
wall opposite the TV...and that seemed about right.  I don't want viewers to
see a show and say, afterward, "Well, that was a nice story."   There has to
be more than that.
<P>
     And while we certainly have our episodes that are paced just a little
more slowly, less intensely, because you have to have variation, have to allow
time for character stories...there are some episodes, like "Sky," that just
hit the viewer right between the eyes with a 2 by 4 *real* hard and say "HEY!
PAY ATTENTION!  WE'RE NOT KIDDING HERE!"
<P>
     Take no prisoners....
