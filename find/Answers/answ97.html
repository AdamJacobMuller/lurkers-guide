     On your point that B5 looks and feels and, arguably, *is* something that
humanity could build, is nominally within our grasp...this is something that
we've been building toward for a while, is part of what we want to do with the
show.  At a recent screening of some episodes for cast and crew, the one most
frequent comment I got afterward was that it *felt* real, that this felt like
how it might really be to work and live out on the fringe.  Many SF futures
are so far beyond our grasp as to enter the realm of unattainable
fantasy...I'd like to point to something as more within our grasp, to remind
us that we can do this, and that maybe we SHOULD do this.
