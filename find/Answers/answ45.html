     We won't see G'Kar's mate this season.

     I believe G'Kar is about 50-60 in Earth terms, which is early middle age
for Narns.

     I keep constantly fighting the urge to have G'Kar return from a trip to
the Narn homeworld with a limp, a cane, and a (temporary) eyepatch, muttering.
"Boy, the Thenta Makur have *no* sense of humor."
