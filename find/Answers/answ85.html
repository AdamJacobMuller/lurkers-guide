<H2>   How does a ship pay for use of a jump gate?</H2>
<P>
     As soon as the ship comes through, its signature is registered and the
fees debited against their account, if they have one at the station.   If not.
the incoming person is asked for payment before being allowed onto the
station.  In some cases, as with transports, corporations buy jump gate access
in bulk, and then assign the routes to their various transports. (Believe it
or not, this actually comes up in dialogue in "Midnight.")
<P>
     Ah, but remember, the government is the one who put the jump gate in; no
one individual or corp could afford to do that.  When your ship, if Earth
registered, comes through, you're automatically billed, just like income
tax...it goes against your credit.  If you're not Earth registered, you pay
when you arrive at an Earth port or orbital transfer station.  Either way, you
pay.  If you try to land somewhere without proper authorization, you'll be
arrested and your ship confiscated.
<P>
     Now, you could probably come through the gate, hang in space for a while.
and go back in again (IF you're a non-Earth registered ship) and not pay
anything...but in that case, what's the point?  It'd be like taking a
difficult trip in a small ship across the Atlantic, and not getting out or
going ashore once you arrive.
