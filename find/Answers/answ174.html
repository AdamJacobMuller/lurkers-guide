     Had a reporter in here the other day, and he asked if it bothered me that
other shows were getting all the ink...meaning, I suppose, TNG and DS9 and
SQ:DSV...and my response really said it all, I think.  It's like the Rocky
movie.  Let the other guys get all the press, do the big flashy stuff, wave
around big budgets...we'll just stand here in a meat locker, pounding slabs of
meat with our bare hands....
