     Just for clarification, while Chris does a great job on the music. the
sound mix is done in the studio with our regular sound guys, who do the
surround mix.  We spend a *lot* of time getting the mix to sound just right,
to take full advantage of the surround channels.  A lot of the credit here
goes to George Johnsen, our co-producer, who is an absolute perfectionist
about this stuff.
