<H2>   Favorite kinds of music?</H2>
<P>
     I have very weird, very eccentric and eclectic tastes in music.  In
addition to Meatloaf, I'm big on Leon Redbone, Indigo Girls, Enya, I'm
starting to like Digable Planets...classical, jazz, big band, hard rock.
celtic, blues, just about anything *except* country, which I couldn't warm up
to even if I were cremated in a crate of Garth Brooks albums.
