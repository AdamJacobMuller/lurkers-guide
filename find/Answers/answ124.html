<H2>   What happened to the old characters on the pilot, not working</H2>
        on the series?
<P>
     On a classified mission (which I hope we will be able to get into at some
point), Laurel has been reassigned out on the Rim, and Dr. Kyle is now working
with the EA President on the issue of alien migration to Earth, a growing
problem to some, a benefit to others.

     Pat Tallman passed on returning to the B5 project.   Our new telepath
will be played by Andrea Thompson, with the character name Talia Winters.

     Much of the Lyta arc will now go to Talia, but there's now a different
way of getting her into that arc.

     What it *does* give me, which is kinda nice, is that the only two people
to have ANY direct contact with a Vorlon...have been transferred back to
Earth.  Which plays wonderfully into something sinister I'd kinda like to
develop that the Earth Alliance is working on behind the scenes....
