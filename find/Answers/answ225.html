     Generally speaking, in television, you're lucky to get on screen about
half of what you had in mind when you saw it in your head.  So far, the
average here is about 80%.  In a very few cases, I don't think the finished
episode delivers as well as it might on the script, but for the clear majority
of them, the episodes come through.  And in some cases, like "Sky" and
"Parliament" and especially "Chrysalis," I got *over* 100% of what I had in
mind...it came out even better than what I'd had in my head when I wrote it.
It's a confluence of many factors...the guest star and how much he/she *gets*
it, the EFX, the direction, and other things.   But across the board, I'd have
to say that I'm very satisfied.
