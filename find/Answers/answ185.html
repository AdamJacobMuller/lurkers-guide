<H2>   What are lurkers? Why not send 'em back?</H2>
<P>
     Actually...y'know...it's funny, but I've been trying to come up with a
name for the folks who just sorta roam B5, the "homeless" or others who have
enough resources to get there in hopes of jobs or new worlds, and don't have
enough to get off again...and who play a running game of tag of sorts with B5
security..."Lurkers" ain't bad....

     Scenario Number One: sending the Lurkers back to Earth.  Comes a call
from Earth Central: "Hell, no, you're NOT shipping them back here, we're
overcrowded enough as it is, we will NOT give you permission to send them back
here."
<P>
     Scenario Number Two: turning them over to their representatives on B5.
G'Kar: "Thank you very much for bringing this to my attention, Commander, I'll
have him sent back at once."  Beat.  The commander leaves.
<P>
     G'Kar: "Get OUT of here and don't come back!  I don't have time to deal
with the likes of you, we're NOT paying to send you back to Homeworld, just
get out!"
