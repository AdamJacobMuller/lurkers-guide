<H2>   What about narration for upcoming seasons?</H2>
<P>
     For the series, my feeling is that the intro should be as short as
possible, almost more for mood than for information.

     The rotating narrator thing was something that I mentioned en passant at
the LosCon screening of "Midnight."  What I noted was that I was considering
rotating the narrators each season; Londo for the pilot; Sinclair for year
one; Ivanova for year two; Garibaldi for year three; G'Kar for year four; and
Delenn for year five.  Haven't decided yet if I'm going to do it or not....

     Yes, we will definitely be changing the narration each year; the year two
narration will likely be shorter, with some personal touch (I'm in the process
of writing it now), and it'll vary in phraseology with each new narrator.

     Second year narration will be Sheridan.  Third year probably either
Ivanova or Delenn.  Fourth year G'Kar.  Fifth year...possibly no one.

     Yes, we'll definitely be redesigning the opening sequence visually as
well as in the narrative.
