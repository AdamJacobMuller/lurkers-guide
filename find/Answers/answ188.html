<H2>   I thought I saw Orion.  Are you showing constellations?</H2>
<P>
     For starters, the Orion constellation would not look like the Orion
constellation from another POV, say, 30 light years from here.  Another
cluster of stars might *look* the same, or similar, but anyone expecting to
see the constellations as we recognize them from here is going to be
disappointed.

     As far as I know, from what Ron's said re: constellations, while it may
look like Orion, it isn't.  It's perception, the mind looking for patterns it
recognizes.
