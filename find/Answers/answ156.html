     The editing, by the way, is a fascinating process.  Television is the
process of making choices: you choose how to write the scene, you choose who
you want to play the scene, the actor chooses how he wants to play the
character, the director chooses how to stage the scene, the cinematographer
chooses how to light and frame the scene, and then you and the editor choose
how to structure that scene using the finished film.
<P>
     What you have in your hands (not literally, since we're all computerized
now, and hardly anyone uses film anymore in editing) is the film for a scene.
You've got the master shot, showing everyone.  You may have 1, 2 or 3 takes of
that shot.  Then you get the medium, close, and two-shots, as well as
reverses.  You get 2-3 of those, times the number of characters in the scene
(i.e., 2 close-ups of Sinclair in the scene, 2 or 3 close-ups of Garibaldi.
plus the over-the-shoulder shots of both, on and on).  Though the staging is
the same, the pacing of lines varies, the delivery varies, inflection, stance.
attitude...there are subtle differences that become terribly important when
you start cutting film.  Maybe the first close-up has the intensity you want
in the first half, but falls off in the second part, so now you use part two
of take two, which *does* finish with the required intensity.  But in that
take, the actor visible in the same scene isn't quite where he's standing in
the master shot, and you have to go back to the master for the next shot
because that's where you need to see X entering the room....
<P>
     It's a complex, complicated, exhausting process that requires you to hold
the various scenes and shots all in your head at the same time, particularly
if you want to do any last-minute restructuring, or "borrow" a shot from
another scene to fill out this scene because there was a problem on the angle
in what you've got.
<P>
     But I'd be a liar if I didn't say it's an awful lot of fun.  You can make
a scene play 50 different ways, depending on how you edit it.  And we've got
some *great* editors working with us.

     We're using some state of the art computers for our editing work, in some
ways in advance of EditDroid.  The first line is the Avid editor, which
digitizes all of the printed takes from an episode and stores them in
full-motion video/audio the same way you store a .gif file.  You can have
instant access to everything; you don't have to swap disks in or out, and it's
all immediate.  Once you've edited the thing to where you want it, you save
the information to the system.  Then you provide all of the required prints to
the major computer system at the editing house which then *automatically*
assembles the entire cut overnight.  Operates almost entirely without
supervision.  You come in in the morning, and your cut is waiting for you.
<P>
     we're able to stay further toward the cutting edge of technology because
we're small, new, and can react faster than something that has to work through
an entrenched studio bureaucracy that has already invested major bucks in its
old systems, and doesn't want to re-tool since what it has basically works
fine.
