     Well, we've finished finalizing our main/opening titles sequence, and
done the on-line editing, and now will put it into the process and start
putting whole shows together.  We've decided, in order to emphasize the
cinematic aspects of our show, that it's taking more of a movie approach to TV
SF...to do the main titles in letterbox format.
<P><HR><P>
     Yes, the main titles will be in letterbox format for conventional
televisions...we're taking the footage that we've shot in 16:9 aspect ratio.
and shrinking it down just enough to fit, so there's black on top and bottom.
the same way that, for instance, TNT shows movies in their full aspect ratio.
And we've custom designed some CGI that also is in that format.  (In the case
of series footage that we're using, there you'll be able to compare the
regular aspect ratio of the broadcast with what's in the main titles.  In
other words, there's a scene in "Parliament" of a Minbari gathering.  In
regular aspect, as part of the show, you'll see it one way.  We've clipped a
section of that for the main titles and used the full aspect ratio, and in
that you'll see the far right and left sides normally clipped for standard TV
aspect ratio.)

     Apparently this is also done on Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman, I learned the
other day, so that'll give you some sense of it.  It's very effective at
giving a real cinematic feel to your main titles.

     RE: composition...the monitor on which the director and DP can watch and
see what the camera sees has on it demarkations to show the regular aspect
ratio, as well as the widescreen view.  Which pretty much allows them to
compose for both, for the most part.

     We're not shooting on videotape, so it's kind of a moot point.  We're
shooting on film, which can be converted to HDTV standards *very* easily. The
pixel density is a function of where you go once you decide to convert the
film.  It's now being converted to video at standard resolution; when HDTV
comes into existence commercially, the film will be reprocessed out and
transferred to video at that level.
<P><HR><P>
     We are shooting in 16:9 aspect ratio, cutting it down to normal TV aspect
ratio for its initial broadcasts.  When a) the laserdisks are in time
released, and b) when HDTV becomes more of a standard, the full letterboxed
aspect ratio will be available.

<H2>   Why not just broadcast the episodes in letterbox?</H2>
<P>
     Given that most household TV sets are fairly small, no, it wouldn't be
fair or prudent to begin broadcasting the episodes in letterbox at this time.
