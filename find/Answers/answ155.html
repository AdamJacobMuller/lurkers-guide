<H2>   How do you deal with the issue of "sound in space"?</H2>
<P>
     And just so everybody knows...so you don't gig me on this later...I have
spent more time than I want to *think* about lately talking with our sound
people about the sound-in-space issue.  We've literally spent HOURS locked up.
discussing various options, middle grounds, extremes and some off-beat
possibilities.  I still don't know what we're going to do exactly, but for
what it's worth, believe me, this has been examined to within an inch of its
(and my) life.  What it comes down to now is this: we will have all of the
options we discussed available to us at the final mix-down, and we will try
them in different combinations.  Whatever works best is what we'll go with.
And we won't know what that is until we get there.

     Today, at Christopher Franke's, I heard the music for "Soul Hunter," and
it's brilliant.  It's very hard to describe...it's not rock, but it's
aggressive, and powerful, not at all synth sounding.  And I think that he just
may have resolved the sound in space question for the most part.  He tried
some things we discussed, and it works great.  So this may be the solution
we've been looking for.  (Though the first one who tells me there's no
orchestra in space gets it in the eye.)

     We've found that what works best is to play primarily music as our space
action/sound bed, overlaying just a tad with tonalities that aren't sound
effects per se in most cases, but more sound cues that suggest a particular
effect.
