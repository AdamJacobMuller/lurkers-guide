<H2>   What do Babylon 5 fans call themselves?  What do you call them?</H2>
<P>
     Most B5 viewers that I've heard from call themselves Fivers, when they
identify themselves as anything other than what they are, people of infinite
taste and sensibility....
<P><HR><P>
     I think the term usually used to describe B5 viewers is, "People Of
Incredible Taste, Perception and Discretion."
