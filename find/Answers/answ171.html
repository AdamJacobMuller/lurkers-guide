     So far, the network (PTEN) is letting us do everything we want to do.
even going for our more dangerous stories.  Which pleases me beyond anything I
can convey to you.  They're trusting us to do what we think is right.

     I think that the PRIMARY reason that B5 is as good as it has been is that
we've been pretty much left to our own devices without much in the way of
interference from the studio/network.  The day a studio begins messing around
with a show is when it pretty much becomes doomed.
