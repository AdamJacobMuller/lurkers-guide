     The fighters are the SA-23E Mitchell-Hyundyne Starfuries, and B5 has four
fighter wings, each with approximately 12 fighters.
<P><HR><P>
     The starfuries are *only* non-atmosphere craft, and they can't hold more
than one person.  The other specs are over at Ron's, and I'll try to remember
to snag them at some point.
<P><HR><P>
     The fighters are built on a cross-wing structure (four wings), but very
different from either X-wing or tie fighters.  The four wings have fore, aft.
top, bottom and side thrusters, so that they can move in any direction...they
can fly left to right, turn backwards, and continue to fly left to right.
flying backwards, and thus fire right to left. They're perfectly designed for
zero-g environments.

     There are a number of influences that go into the markings on the
Starfuries.  (And not all 'furies are so marked; only those that are generally
used by only one pilot, to whom the ship is assigned.)  We took in general the
WW II model, where pilots used to decorate their craft with nose art to
personalize it.  So some of it is of that flavor, while others echo more
ancient heraldry.  (Ivanova's 'fury has an old Russian two-headed eagle in
stylized form.)  Yes, again, an attempt to connect past, present and future.
<P><HR><P>
     Your message is correct; there are various "weights" of Starfuries, some
much more massive and impressive.  The ones on B5 are light, fast, not overly
complicated, and quick-strike machines.  Another kind, which you'll see in the
two-parter, has cockpits fore *and* aft, a two-person ship with much heavier
shielding and armaments; the "Black Omega" version is made for top speed as an
interceptor with advanced stealth components.
<P><HR><P>
     Black Omega Starfuries are *hideously* expensive, rather like Stealth
Bombers.  They have to be carefully maintained, and their existence isn't
generally trumpeted.  (Like the Aurora, for instance.) They're not mainly a
defensive system, but rather an infiltration unit used on black
projects/covert missions.  They're not really meant for an operation like B5.
<P><HR><P>
     Definitely; there are additional fighters berthed inside Earthforce One,
with a minimum four outside on constant patrol.  In addition, it's got some
pretty hefty defensive weaponry on board, though they're worked into the
design so that they don't appear too obvious (bad for PR).
