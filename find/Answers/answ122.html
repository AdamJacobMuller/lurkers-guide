<H2>   What was wrong with the pilot?</H2>
<P>
     At risk of rehashing this one more time, what's missing from the pilot is
25 minutes of additional material that further fleshed out the characters.
<P>
     Each of the characters is being solidly rounded out in the series.
showing multiple sides to each character.  All I can say is that I think
you'll like what we're doing.

     Re: the pilot...I've hashed and rehashed this, and the bottom line is to
see what we do in the series and judge the series by the series.  The DS9
pilot had to explain very little that wasn't specific to the plotline: you
already knew what a bajorran was, what a wormhole was, what the Federation
was, what the cardassians were, on and on and on.  Because they didn't have to
introduce any of that, they could spend time on other character moments.
<P>
     We didn't have that luxury in the pilot.  We had to do what, in essence.
ST has done over 25 years: establish our universe, painting it in broad
strokes, as broad're done with that aspect.  And now we can do our
character-based stories.  Which is exactly what we're doing.
