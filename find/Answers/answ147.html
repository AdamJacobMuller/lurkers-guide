     Here's a Joe Predicts for you: by this time next year, ST will have gone
either completely to CGI, or 95% to CGI.
<P><HR><P>
     Also...apparently, at a convention, Rick Sternbach from ST said that the
ST shows (DS9 and, subsequently, Voyager) would be shifting over to primarily
computer EFX rather than models.  They're going to start coming over to OUR
turf...and engaging in the usual learning curve, trial and erros, which we've
already gone through.
<P>
     Me...I just sit here and smile...and on one level, despite the way it may
appear, I'm pleased.  It shows we were right.  And if they start doing CGI.
it'll force both sides to again be competitive in terms of doing more, pushing
things.  And that friendly competition is good for the blood, it should keep
both shows on the cutting edge.  It'll also enable other shows to come in
using CGI, meaning more SF on the air.
<P>
     It also ties into what I've heard lately, that Paramount is getting
hammered by some of the stations asking why the hell DS9 episodes often cost
1.7 to 2 million dollars an episode to produce, where B5 is doing more, with
half the budget.  I would love to hear the response to that.
<P><HR><P>
     The funny part is that Berman and Pillar, according to mutual
acquaintances and interviews, have been swearing up one side and down the
other that they were never going CGI, were staying models.  And now they are
coming to play on *our* turf.
<P>
     Amblin's got Amigas with ten Screamers.
<P>
     We've got only one Screamer.  But we've got Ron.
