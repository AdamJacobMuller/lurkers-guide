<H2>   What will the timeline be in the B5 story?</H2>
<P>
     I'm working it so that real-time comes close to paralleling story-time in
the series.  The events of the series will pick up approximately six months
after the events of the pilot.  We'll have crossed into another year, so the
first "year" in which the series takes place is 2258, year two of the series
(if we get that far) would be 2259, and so on.

     No, we generally don't announce the day/month in the episodes, though
sometimes dates or seasons are referred to tangentially or offhandedly. The
real significant progression is year to year, which is why each year of the
show will be marked in the opening narration and parallel real time (season 1:
2258, season 2: 2259, etc.).
<P><HR><P>
     There will be some time between episodes in the B5 universe; in some
cases it's about a week, in some cases much longer, as long as we end up
covering roughly a year.

     Approximately nine months have passed since the time of the pilot and the
birth of the series.
