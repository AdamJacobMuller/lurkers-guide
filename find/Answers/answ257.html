     Now here's comedy...we're fielding a Babylon 5 softball as one of the
showbiz leagues.  (Many shows in town have softball teams, and th ey've
organized into something that has grown quite substantially into a Big Deal.)
We're making up jerseys for the team, and on the front there will be the B5
logo, and on the back, for the team player number, there will be 5.  That's
all.  The only number.  Which will make calling the game a WONDERFUL
challenge..."And on shortstop we've got number five...out in center field is
number five...with number five pitching and catching."
<P>
     Everything about this show is surreal.
<P>
     BTW...our first game is against the SeaQuest team.
