     We've made some minor modifications to the jumpgate effect, in the
texture and color of the warp EFX.  It looks a little less computer-y, and
some science guys suggested that there should be red-shift built into the
thing.  So now when objects come *out* of hyperspace, and we're looking into
the jumpgate, the warp effect is blue; when you enter the jumpgate, it shifts
toward orange/red.
