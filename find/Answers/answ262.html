     Incidentally...as long as I'm here...an advisory.  We've got about as
much security as anyone can *have* on a stage...but as with TNG and other SF
shows, we've had our share of things suddenly vanishing.  We lost a biggie the
other day, swiped by someone.  As mentioned, we re-examined G'Kar's
makeup/prosthetic, and did some minor redesigning.  Prior to final approval, a
full-size (head and neck) sculpture was done, painstakingly hand-painted.
There's only the one.  And someone swiped it, right out of Doug Netter's
office, where it was hanging on the wall.  I couldn't even begin to tell you
how much it's worth; just the physical value alone would be considerable, let
alone collector's value.
<P>
     I'm putting this out here so that, if anyone here should see it at a
convention, or a dealer's room, you should know that it's stolen merchandise.
and should be reported to the police.  There's no chance of mistaking this for
something else, since there's literally only the one in existence.
