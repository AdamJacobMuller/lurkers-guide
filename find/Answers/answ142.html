<H2>   How much stock footage is used in establishing shots?</H2>
<P>
     We did some library stuff in the first few eps, but as we've ben (been)
spending more time, we've built up more, and generally we have 3-4 new
establishers per ep.  So there's less and less of it the deeper you get into
the series.  (And when you come down to it, a shot of the station against a
planet is going to be pretty much the same in general, unless there's specific
activity going on around it.)

     We did a lot of exterior transitional shots in the first few eps of B5 to
reinforce where we are and what this is; it diminishes in frequency the deeper
into the series you get.
