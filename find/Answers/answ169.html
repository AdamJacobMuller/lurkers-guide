<H2>   What's the budget of a B5 episode?</H2>
<P>
     The details of the budget per episide are classified...but you could
easily take DS9's budget, cut it in half, and you'd still have more than we've
got.

     Which is, again, part of the overall plan...if we can prove that you can
do quality SF on a budget comparable to non-SF series, it'll open the gates
for more shows down the road.
