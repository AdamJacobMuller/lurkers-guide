     I have, btw, now seen the finished (minus music and some minimal EFX)
first episode of B5 with Bruce.  We did the producer's cut yesterday, and I
have to say that I think it's very nice.

     And Bruce does a wonderful job in the role.  He's brought a lot to the
table, and I think people are going to be very pleased.

     Yes, Sheridan is descended from Gen. Philip John Sheridan of the Union
Army.

     Sheridan, the universe willing, will be there throughout the rest of the
B5 story.

     Only Ivanova has served with him before; Garibaldi doesn't know him from
Adam, and this will lead to some awkwardness and questions of trust down the
road.

     Sheridan is a soldier.  A soldier is told, in wartime, THIS is your
enemy.  You kill the enemy or your enemy kills you.  Afterward, you're in the
same position American soldiers were in after the end of WW II when it came
time to reconcile with the Germans and the Japanese.  It can sometimes be very
awkward...and sometimes reconciliation takes a while.

     Captain John Sheridan is a war hero, of sorts; he squeaked out the only
real victory of the Earth/Minbari War.  (Which means the Minbari don't
generally like him a lot.)  He did what he did because that's his job.  He's a
professional soldier.  For the last two years, he's been commanding the
Agamemmnon, a high-visibility Earthforce starship on deep patrol.  As such, he
has had to learn to work with a number of different races and species.

     "Sounds like a forumla to really PO the Minbari."
<P>
     Yup.

     In some ways, his character is somewhat more well-rounded than was the
case with Sinclair, over whom a general sense of doom often seemed to hang.
Sheridan is often very thoughtful and introspective; at other times, he can be
just a bit eccentric; he leads by respecting those who work under him, and
giving them room to grow; like any career officer, he HATES the bureaucracy
with a passion, and this is the one thing that can drive him nuts; he knows
that commanding B5 is a great opportunity, but he also knows that his presence
brings certain complications with it, and he's very ambivilant about that
aspect; he's the son of a diplomatic envoy who disappeared on his 21st
birthday, running off to see (of all things) the new Dali Lama being
installed; he has a very easygoing manner, and a great sense of humor.  He
quickly re-forms a friendship with Ivanova, for whom he has great respect and
professional admiration.  (For a time she served under him at Io.)
