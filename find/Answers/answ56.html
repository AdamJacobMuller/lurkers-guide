     Well, we finished casting for the role of Lennier, who is Delenn's
aide/attache.  We were looking for someone who could give us the most as a
quiet, restrained, almost monk-like character, fairly innocent in his way.
<P>
     And in a very nice bit of synchronicity, the person who came in and
knocked us out with his audition was Bill Mumy, who has now been cast in the
role.  Aside from his work in Lost in Space, Bill is a terrific actor whose
role, I think, may sometimes have become a stumbling block from time to time.
as did the roles of Shatner, Nimoy and others from Trek.   Here he will be a
very different kind of character, barely recognizeable beneath the Minbari
makeup, and can show a very different sort of approach to his work.  We're
very excited to have him on the team.  (I think it will also be good to have
someone around from a prior successful SF TV series who can help our cast
prepare for the reception this show is likely to receive...and I suspect that
very few if any of them really understand yet what that will mean.)

     Mumy's role, to answer that question, is a recurring role; I think he'll
be in about half a dozen episodes or so for us.  To the best of my knowledge.
this won't interfere with any other obligations Mumy has.

     BTW, this week will Bill Mumy's first week on B5, and he's done a very
nifty job as Lennier.  He brings a wonderful sense of absolute innocence...the
proverbial innocent abroad...to Lennier's character.  The Minbari prosthetics
look great on him, enhancing the sense he brings to the character.  He's also
great with the cast, and keeping things up during shooting.  At one point, as
they're leaving camera, Delenn says to Lennier, who has just arrived at the
station, "Now tell me of home; I have been away far too long."  His ad-libbed
off-camera response: "Beatlemania is back." (Another ad-lib for another shot:
"Minimalls...they're everywhere," and "Well, we just got Pizza Hut and
cable.")
