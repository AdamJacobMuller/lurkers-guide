     Our sound designer has finished working on the gun-sounds, and they sound
very impressive.  We've come up with a different way of handling the gun
sequences -- firing, impact, and sound -- based more on how these things would
actually work if they existed.  And let me tell you, if you EVER ran into or
heard one of these things coming your way, you'd get the hell out FAST.  We
actually sat down for hours and tried to determine the effects on impact, on
firing, on the surrounding atmosphere, and how to avoid the 30 mph problem
usually associated with TV lasers.  (That is, you trace the "laser" across
screen, you see it move, which means that this beam of light is moving slower
than a bullet...which is silly.)  By all rights, it should be nearly invisible
and nearly instantaneous...but then you don't see anything.  We've managed to
come up with a nifty little solution to the problem.
