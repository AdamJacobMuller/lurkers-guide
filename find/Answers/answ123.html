<H2>   Why the big delay between the pilot and the series?</H2>
<P>
     We'd always figured on going right to series, but once we had done the
pilot, the studio said, in essence, "Well, we've got a pilot, we don't know if
the market will sustain more than one space SF series, no other SF series has
done well lately...maybe we ought to air the pilot first, and get the ratings.
before committing to a series."  And that's what happened...much to our
consternation at first, but in the long run it was a blessing in disguise.
because that interim period allowed us to really do a lot to make the show
better.

     Actually, the funny thing is, I don't much mind if people who hadn't seen
the pilot don't catch the rebroadcast.  What we're doing now is SO radically
better than the pilot that I almost can't watch it now.
