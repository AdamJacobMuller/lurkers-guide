     BTW, since as mentioned Stewart Copeland is going to be off touring and
doing an album and other stuff, we've had to lock down someone else as our
resident composer.  Someone suggested here numerous times has now been
confirmed: Christopher Franke, of Tangerine Dream, who has done the
soundtracks for such projects as Thief, Angel Falls, Universal Soldier.
Tommyknockers and others.  In addition to being a solid percussion man and a
great musician, he's a real techie, up on the latest technologies involving
music and sound, and will be able to give B5 a VERY unique sound.

     It was the discussion early on here about composers, in which Chris
Franke's name was mentioned, that bumped him to the top of our list and helped
motivate us to take a look.  One more way the interaction has been positive.
<P>
     And yes, he will be doing the entire season.  And composing a new B5
theme.  (I keep suggesting something along the lines of "Bali High" from
"South Pacific."  They keep hitting me with week old halibut. "Babylonnnnnnn
FiiiiiiIIIIve.....")

     Well, we deliver our first final finished totally done episode on about
October 8th.  Christopher Franke has some *great* ideas on how to handle the
music, and plans a curious blending of music and sound effects in some places.
plus instruments from other parts of the world not normally heard in the US.
to try and create a "new music" kind of sound.
<P><HR><P>
     The B5 soundtrack for the series is built from many different kinds of
pieces, synthesized (based on one of the most extensive collection of
musical/audio samples in the world, which Christopher has been in the process
of collecting ever since he practically hand-assembled his first Moog), and
symphonic, since we're using the Berlin Symphonic Orchestra for some elements
of our score.  It changes dramatically depending on the subject.
<P><HR><P>
     Christopher Franke is developing themes for each of the characters, plus
themes for the station, for space in general, and for our various
aliens...something that carries a sense of the minbari, the grey council.
others.  He even wrote a wonderful little Narn libretto for G'Kar, a la
Gilbert and Sullivan.  Some elements carry across shows, but in each show
there are new and different pieces that work wonderfully.  He's nothing less
than terrific.
<P><HR><P>
     Actually, only a portion of the music for any given episode of B5
consists of synthesized music.  Much of it is performed by Christopher's
orchestra in Berlin, which is hooked via digital lines to his studio here in
town.  Not all, certainly, but more than you might think is from that live
orchestra.
<P><HR><P>
     Frankly, in the long run, I'm *much* happier with Chris Franke.  Stewart
was more of the "let's make a library of music and draw from it and remix a
lot" school.  Nothing wrong with that, lots of shows do it.  Chris, on the
other hand, uses *very* little library stuff; each episode is scored
individually, and the music is lush, driving, powerful.  I couldn't be
happier.

     After "Grail," we had a discussion with Chris about funny music.  We do
not anticipate further discussions.  (In a full season of music for B5, this
is the only discussion we've had of a critical nature, which is extraordinary
for any series; he's done a lot of wonderful work for us.
