<H2>   Will we be seeing more of the vegitated inside of the station?</H2>
<P>
     Yes, we will.  In addition to the Zen garden, and the Fresh Air
Restaurant, we'll be seeing the Orchard, the Pavillion, and the Maze, though
you won't see the last one there for some time.  I don't think it shows up
until "Chrysalis."

     There is some limited life within the garden...some birds (which you can
hear sometimes), and insects, and the like.  (In one shot you can see an
insect fly off one of our actors.  Yeah, sure, like we planned that....)  It's
generally one season in the Garden, and plants requiring variation are raised
in a separate hydroponics area, such as the orchard (seen in "War Prayer").

     Re: the crops/parkland...no, there are no settlements there.  You don't
waste precious land needed for farming and oxygen reclamation and hydroponic
gardens to throw up a shack or house.  Those who work in the central Garden
area live in standard B5 quarters.  There are some recreational areas, a hedge
maze (as you'll see later this season), and we're adjusting some of our sets
to reveal more of the garden area.  No one "camps out" on the surface; if they
try, they're destroying precious crops, and are arrested.
