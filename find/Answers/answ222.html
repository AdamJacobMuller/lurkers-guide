<H2>   How about a fan club?</H2>
<P>
     Since the series began to air, there's been a flood of mail and calls, so
some kind of organization will be necessary to handle this, though no
framework has been finalized yet.

     We're in the process of setting up some kind of fan liaison office. which
would do some limited sales stuff, just enough to pay its own way.  Should
this come about, we'll sell some of the B5 scripts through this office.  (One
difference between us and ST is that we will pay the freelance writers a
*royalty* on any scripts of theirs we sell.)  But this is still in the works.
