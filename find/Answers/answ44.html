     For the role of Dr. Stephen Franklin we have found an intense and
powerful african-american actor named Richard Biggs.  He's younger, in his
mid- to late thirties, dedicated, sharp and...again, the word I keep coming
back to is *intense*.  Consider a younger Dr. (and I'm going to misspell this)
Debakke: self-assured, confident almost to a fault.  He comes largely out of
an experimental background, so his bedside manner isn't all it should be. He's
often impatient.  His character is the newest addition to the B5 "team" of
characters, and this will lead to a fair amount of conflict.

     Just a word or two on Dr. Franklin.  We're not bringing in someone who
will play the role as a sloppy, floppy puppy with a ball.  Dr. Franklin is
someone who's a little on the arrogant side, very serious, very dedicated, and
is frequently in opposition to the military side of B5.    He's a very intense
character, little in the way of bedside manner, invariably sure that he's
right.  And sometimes he is going to be very, very wrong...with some difficult
and painful consequences.
