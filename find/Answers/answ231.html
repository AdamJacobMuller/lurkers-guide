<H2>   Why "J. Michael Straczynski"? What do people call you? What do we call</H2>
        you?  How is it pronounced?
<P>
     It's "J. Michael Straczynski" on title credits mainly because that's the
way it looks best, frankly.  Lets you sneak up on the whole name in
progressively larger bites.  Joe Michael Straczynski looks kinda dumb to me.
also too long; Joe Straczynski is too short, and unbalanced in terms of layout
(he said quickly).  My friends call me Joe.  My crew calls me Joe. One person
on the crew kept calling me Mr. Straczynski, which you should try saying out
loud sometime.  Even *I* can't do it.  It was so painful to listen to that
after a while I kept calling back "Joe" at him until he got the message.

     I've never been real big on formality.  And I know that typing
Straczynski can be a fearsome thing indeed.  Fingers were never meant to move
in that particular configuration, I think, and more than one person has had to
dial 911 with his nose when his fingers tangled on the keyboard.
<P>
     Point being..."Joe" is just fine.  If there's another Joe in a thread (as
above), "Mr. S." is is also fine if you need to make the distinction. (One or
two have called me Big S.  Some comment that I'm the biggest S in town...and I
wish they wouldn't smile quite so broadly when they say it, or hold it quite
so long.)
<P>
     In any event, we're all in this together, so I think we can let formality
slide.
