     Sinclair functions within the parameters of Earthforce Command, but much
in the way as a provisional governor might function.  He is answerable both to
his superior officers in Earthforce, *as well as* the Babylon 5 Senate
Oversight and Appropriations Committee.  A senatorial liaison often works
between Sinclair and Earthdome (the EA capital city).
