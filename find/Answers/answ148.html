     Just a note...re: the CGI looking crisp and unblurred...the blurring
you're used to seeing is an artifact of atmosphere.  There is no air in space.
and thus no blurring.  (Check the latest NASA footage for more on this.)
That's of course why they put Hubble in space, to avoid the problems of
blurring caused by atmosphere.
<P>
     We probably could've put in atmospheric blurring to give it a different
depth-of-field, but we have this bugaboo about being a -science- fiction
show....
