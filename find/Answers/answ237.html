     One thing I can mention now, since it's nearly finished: see, I have this
real problem with nepotism.  Specifically...I hate it.  As a result, I make
people I know work twice as hard.  The closer the tie, the more the person has
to work to prove him or herself.
<P>
     Kathryn Drennan, my Spousal Overunit, is also a writer, and has written
for many other shows, primarily in animation, but with some forays into other
areas.  (She was co-author on the Night Gallery series of articles I wrote for
Twilight Zone Magazine, as one fr'instance, and was a producer with public
televison for some time.)
<P>
     Anyway, she desperately wanted to write a B5 script.  But because of my
feelings about nepotism, I refused to give her an assignment.  (I can be a
REAL pain in the ass.)  Something similar happened when I was working on The
Real Ghostbusters; she loved the show, and wanted to write for it.  I put her
through the wringer: she had to submit written premises, just like any other
freelance writer, which were then sent on to the producers for final approval.
They did not know of any relation between her and me; they based their
approval only on the merits of the story.  Period.  And she ended up writing
two episodes: "Egon's Dragon" and "The Man Who Never Reached Home." (The
former is considered a favorite by many viewers of the show.)  Only long after
we finished production did the exec producers on TRGBs learn that there was a
relationship there; it was all based on the quality of the work.
<P>
     But in the case of B5, I *am* the exec producer, so it became more
difficult.  At first I said simply no.  Finally, I set into place a number of
conditions/provisions.  NOT because she wouldn't do a great script, but only
because I don't like the look of nepotism; I hate it, and I hate the way this
town operates on the principles of nepotism.  The conditions were that she had
to write the script completely on spec, no assignment; not a spec outline.
which is shorter, but a spec *script*.   It would then have to pass muster
in-house; if even one person thought it wasn't up to snuff, it got deep sixed.
And revisions would not be handled by me, for the most part; she would have to
work with Larry, who has a reputation (as Katherine Lawrence can attest) to
not pulling his punches.   No favoritism.  Then the script would have to pass
muster with Warners.   IF, after all that, the script was approved, then it
would be bought, and not a moment before.  If anywhere along the line it
didn't meet one of those criteria...then it would be a 50 page learning
experience and nothing more.
<P>
     Well, I'm pleased to say that it *did* pass muster with everyone, and "By
Any Means Necessary" is now over halfway through production, with a number of
people -- including Michael O'Hare -- saying it's their favorite so far.
mainly for very odd reasons.  The premise is one that ST would never, EVER do.
which is one thing I like about it; it also shows us more on the inner
workings of B5, the blue-collar types who keep the whole place
operational...and what happens when that falls apart.  The B story gets into a
confrontation between G'Kar and Londo when Londo interferes in an important
Narn religious observation.

     Kathryn's last name is Drennan.  Her full credit is Kathryn M. Drennan.
Not Straczynski.  Probably displaying considerable wisdom on her part.  Ten
thousand letters, no vowels.
