<H2>   How do centauri wear their hair?</H2>
<P>
     Centauri males wear their hair in this fashion, the length of which is
determined by the person's status.  Centauri women scorn such symbols of
status and go bald except for a knot of hair from the back.  (Sort of a
peacock approach.)

     Certainly, you could wear your hair longer than your status permits, but
it's like pretending to a status you don't have, which is viewed as pathetic.

     Londo's people go for jewelry and ornamentation such as medals and
sunbursts and the like.

     It's a standard bed, works fine.  Though we *did* have a thing in mind
where Londo sits up in bed, having just had wonderful sex, and his hair is now
hanging limp...but in a sudden burst of sanity we decided against it.
