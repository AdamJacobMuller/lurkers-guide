     Centauri males have six.

     The awful thing is that the two women in props -- who were having FAR too
much fun with this -- kept bringing me the tentacle to verify the shape. size,
consistency, do we see veins or not....

     Centauri females, btw, have six narrow...ummm...slots on their backs.
three on either side of the spine, right around the base of the spine.

     A sick thing that you should want to know these things; sicker still to
come UP with these things....
