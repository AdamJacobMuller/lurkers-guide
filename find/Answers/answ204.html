     Mike: you needn't worry.  I find all-powerful beings of any stripe
incredibly boring.  I find it more interesting when ordinary people are
summoned to do extraordinary things, and must rise above their limitations
without losing their limitations; succeeding in spite of them.  Sinclair is a
man, period.  He may have a great calling ahead of him, as did Churchill or
Lincoln or Alexander or (for all we know) Rondo Hatton, but they're all just
men in the final analysis.
