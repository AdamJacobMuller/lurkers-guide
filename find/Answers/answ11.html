<H2>   Why did Londo do the narration in the pilot?</H2>
<P>
     Yeah, Londo seems like the *least* likely person to do the opening
narration for a show like this; you don't even see him for nearly two full
acts, and it's the kind of thing you'd expect the Commander to do.
<P>
     But there are reasons for everything....
<P><HR><P>
     "Mankind" was being used by Londo specifically in relation to humans, not
sentient aliens including his own race.  Earthers.  Which was one reason (of
many) I wanted his character to be the narrator, someone looking in from the
outside.
<P>
     As for the Third Age, it's -- oh, darn, look at the time, have to go....
