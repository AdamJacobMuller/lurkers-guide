<H2>   How big is the Earth Alliance?</H2>
<P>
     The EA is fairly large, but not on a par with the Centauri at this point.
There are various space platforms/colonies, colonies on the Moon, Mars, a
major transfer point off Io...they've gone in and "helped" a number of
bronze-tech worlds (that happened to have certain resources useful to EA), and
are generally spreading like mice in a cheese factory.

     You are correct in that the Earth Alliance consists in the main of
humans.  Aliens are generally not integrated into the system, except in very
low-level stuff.  (In some bronze-tech worlds where humans have come in and
pulled an India/England relationship, you may have colonial governors who are
native aliens, but are basically puppets.)  There's more than just Mars, Earth
and the Sol colonies; there are a number of other worlds and systems out there
into which Earth has made a dent.
