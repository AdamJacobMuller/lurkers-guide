     Travel from point A to point B takes some amount of time.  But when
you're near your destination, you can wait in hyperspace and choose to come
out at a specific moment.  There's considerable speculation that both the
Minbari and Vorlons have ships standing by in hyperspace, at various
locations, in case they're needed quickly.  (In the pilot movie. Laurel
Takashima even mentions that they are probably doing this.)  It's a
correlation to the TOT (Time On Target) philosophy; you can send ships in from
various sectors, have them lurk in hyperspace, then all come out at once.
