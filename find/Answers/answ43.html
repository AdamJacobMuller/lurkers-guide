     I can't remember if I mentioned this here or not...but did I note that
apparently the B5 pilot is the #1 best selling/renting tape these days in
Croatia?  What this means I have no idea....

     Mira was in a Croatian choir?!  I didn't know this.  She's never
mentioned it.  I know that she was an actress there, but this part is news to
me.  I must ask her about it when she comes in next week.
