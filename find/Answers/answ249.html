<H2>   How good are you at math?</H2>
<P>
     Joe does not learn math in one episode.  Joe does not learn math in one
*year*.  I took bonehead math in college three -- count 'em three -- times.
and only passed the third semester because the class was taught by the same
instructor, and the third time I wandered into his class, he siad, (or said).
"Here...just go, I'll give you a C, just...leave."
