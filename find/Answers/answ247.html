<H2>   Do you plan on doing any more TV shows after B5?</H2>
<P>
     It's hard, because as much as I enjoy TV, it's basically ephemeral; books
stick around.  And I got into this whole gig at the beginning by writing
prose.  Which is why, as I've noted before, if the B5 story goes its full
length -- whether that's just 5 years, or with a possible spinoff, 10 years --
when it's over, I'm retiring from TV.  By that point, I will have said
everything I want to say for TV.  Then it's a house somewhere outside London
or Cambridge, and novels.  I figure I'll be about 50 at that point (assuming
10 years), and I'll have enough years left in me to tell some decent stories
before it gets dark outside.
