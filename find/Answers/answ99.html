     The history of Earth for about the last 100 years prior to the time of B5
is broken out, and though it isn't laid out in detail in the series, it forms
a reference backdrop for us, so it's all consistent when we refer to any part
of it.  The pilot was 2257, the first year of the series is 2258, year two
would be 2259, and so on.  The story requires 5 years of story time as well as
5 years of real time to tell.  Things have to go through some real time lapse
for the story to work out properly. Consequently, the narration at the top of
the show ("...the year is 2258, the name of the place is Babylon 5") will be
changed each season.
