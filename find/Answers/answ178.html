     Re: satellite...one of the more interesting stories I've heard lately is
that B5 is *very* popular via satellite...in Iran and Iraq, both of whom lay
claim of one sort or another to the original Babylon.  Apparently that a
Westerner has set a series in their well-remembered Babylon that is NOT a
negative thing but a positive thing has got both countries quite pleasantly
astonished.
