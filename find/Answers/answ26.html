<H2>   How do languages get handled in B5?</H2>
<P>
     There are actually several languages heard on B5, though you have to work
to hear them.  (Those with surround will have an easier time.)  For instance.
in the customs area, announcements are made first in English, then in
Interlac.  In the bazaar area, you'll hear chirrups and whistles and clicks
and a wide range of language-sounds.

     Re: language...if you're going to America from Russia as an ambassador.
you're expected to know English fluently.  B5 is funded by (mostly) and
operated by Earth, and English is more or less the dominant language.  Hence.
they know it well enough to communicate with us.  (BTW, this is already
happening here...every airport on the planet, for example, uses english
consistently in the control tower to planes, and more people outside
english-speaking countries are educated in english than we are in alternate
languages.)

     The language facilities of aliens will vary; probably the most fluent (by
virtue of necessity) are the ambassadors, whose english is perfect or nearly
so (cyberlink to the brain dumping the English equivilants of their own
language and grammar directly into the brain, very expensive and not a little
painful).  The drawback is that some cultural references or some contextual
areas may not be as clear as required.  (Londo wondering about ramoras, Delenn
unsure for a moment about poetry....)

     We've already instituted the need for translation devices on several
characters.  There are basically three dominant languages on B5, a kind of
interstellar esperanto, Centauri, and English, which is the more or less
official military/diplomatic language.  But not everyone is going to know
those languages, so you need another way.  We have translation teams
(referenced though not seen in "Soul Hunter"), and physical translation
devices for use after we've had sufficient contact with a given group or
individual to be able to decode two languages into one another.
<P>
     (Incidentally, we're going with a slightly different version of English
for things like airlocks and such, alongside the visual pictograms.  Not
everyone who can speak english will have an immediate grasp of the intricacies
of the language, and there have been multi cultural/esperanto like influences
on English over the next 200 years.  So for things like Universe Today, you
have standard conventional English, since that's primarily an Earther-oriented
publication.  But then you have signs that read, for instance SECUR AREA, with
an accent over the U.  We've taken the liberty of simplifying some aspects of
english for nonhumans, as well as trying to figure out how the impact of
multi- culturalism might affect language ovese of 200 years.)

     Yeah, that's one thing I've kind of slated in as a B story in a given
episode...an alien comes aboard and they just can't quite manage to
communicate, it's just too damned foreign in its thinking.  (What I'd love is
for them to find out at the end that it's some other alien's damned cat or
something, and they've been spending all this time trying to communicate with
something that ain't sentient...but with aliens, how can you tell sometimes?)
<P><HR><P>
     We're trying to work out the languages to some detail, but not as much as
I'd like, at this point.  It'll probably have to wait until the post-season
hiatus before I can sit down and really start pulling together a rough
dictionary of sorts.
