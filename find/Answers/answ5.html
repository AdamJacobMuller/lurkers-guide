<H2>   Watching Twin Peaks requires watching every episode, will B5 really</H2>
        be any different?

     The comment re: Twin Peaks is correct; I loved TP dearly, but if you
missed one episode, you were screwed.  The way the story is constructed, you
can come in at any point, even miss episodes, and still be able to follow the
thing.  It's just that the *more* you watch, the more you'll get out of it.
the more things you'll pick up on.  It's a very difficult task from a writing
point of view, but worth the effort, I think.
