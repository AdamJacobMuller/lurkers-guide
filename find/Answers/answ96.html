     I don't believe in the notion that, when we go to the stars, we have to

It's our differences that *strengthen* us.  It's not all going to vanish in
200 years.  There are cultures in the eastern part of the world that have

instead of numbers, pills instead of food, and birth by machine.  Much of TV
SF makes the similar error.
