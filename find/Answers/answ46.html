     We're also doing some minor modifications to G'Kar's prosthetic, making
the chin less squared, the mouth a little broader, and the whole thing again
easier to put on and take off.  It will also look far more realistic; parts of
it LOOKED like a prosthetic when you got up close.

     It's one thing to throw heavy prosthetics on an actor who's only going to
wear it for the 4 weeks required for the pilot.  But to wear something day in
and day out for 22 episodes...you have to think about that.  Our own concern
was making it look even *better* for both of them, and we've found a way to do
that.
