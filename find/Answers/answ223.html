     "JMS reminds me a little of Kosh...or is it the other way around?"
<P>
     If it helps, bear in mind in which brain Kosh was *created*, and where he
resides in off-hours, in this big circle running around in my skull with
Delenn, Kosh, G'Kar and Londo chasing one another endlessly, like white mice
in a wheel....
