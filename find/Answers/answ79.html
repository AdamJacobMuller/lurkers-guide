     Re: starships from Earth...yes, you'll be seeing a wide range of ships.
from smaller transports and trading vessels to big mothers.  It is something
of an empire, and the ships come in as many varied forms as we have cars and
trucks and semis and tanks and on and on....

     Civilian spacecraft are fairly common; they're expensive, to be sure, and
if you're just going from point a to point b, it makes more sense just to book
passage on something, but many folks now make their living in space, so
transport is required.

     BTW, have named an Earth Alliance Cruiser Hyperion, in notation of the
library....

     The Hyperion is not typical; it's one of the ships that survived the War.
Not many did.  There are niftier, newer ships built in the last eleven years
that you'll be seeing eventually.
