     You really have to do whatever's right by the story.  Some adult themes
have to be handled in an adult fashion.  There are some very adult themes in
B5.  Some you may like, some you may not.  I don't think we'll be able to go
in for nudity or the like because I don't think the stations would permit it.
If they did...I still don't know if I'd use it or not, because it would really
depend on the story.
