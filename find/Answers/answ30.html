<H2>   When will we know about Kosh Naranek, and vorlons in general?</H2>
<P>
     There's simply nothing that I can say about Kosh just now.
<P><HR><P>
     We will reveal what Kosh is a LOT sooner than year 5.  Closer to the end
of year 2.
<P><HR><P>
     The Vorlons are the great unknown.  They occupy a *huge* sector of space.
No expedition ever sent to Vorlon space has ever returned, or sent back word.
No human had ever even *seen* a Vorlon prior to Kosh's arrival on B5.  Their
technology is vastly superior to just about everyone else's.  To unravel the
mystery, to maybe get a *piece* of their tech, is more than sufficient
inducement, I'd think.
<P><HR><P>
     Kosh doesn't need an assistant.  In fact, no one's *really* quite sure
what it is Kosh *does* most of the day.
<P><HR><P>
     Kosh is always and forever *exactly* what he appears to be, no less and
no more.  At the same time, Kosh is absolutely *nothing* like what he appears
to be.
<P>
     These are not contradictory statements.
<P>
     And this is about the straightest answer I've given yet on the subject,
believe it or not.
