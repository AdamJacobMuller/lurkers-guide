     And there *is* a utilitarian reason behind its design.  In addition, we
want to show something VERY alien in design and construction...and frankly.
there's NO reason a ship that isn't ever going to enter atmosphere needs to
look aerodynamic.  In time, you'd move toward things that are visually or
aesthetically interesting.  In this culture (Vorlon), art and science are
closely allied, so this extension into the look of their ships is quite
natural.  Concepts about what ships are have become very rigid and inflexible
thanks to the preponderance of SF-TV shows. We want to loosen that up.  And
that look DOES, as stated, have a practical aspect about it as well, which
will be seen down the road.
