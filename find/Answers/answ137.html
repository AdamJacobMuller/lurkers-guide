<H2>   Do the cast members know their characters' fates?</H2>
<P>
     Some of the cast know the full extent of their character's story, some
know a little, some know very little.  In those cases where we need to set
stuff up for down the line, we have to explain some of these things.  Some of
the cast want to know their future, some don't.
