<H2>   Why is Sinclair running this station? What rank would the</H2>
        administrator have been if it hadn't been Sinclair?
<P>
     As for Sinclair's status as both commander and ambassador...that is
something we're going to deal with in the series.  By all rights, he shouldn't
even BE there.  EA tried to stick an Admiral or some other high-ranking
officer there.  The first race to sign onto the station, the Minbari, had
approval over who was sent to that post.  They rejected everyone suggested.
right down the line, until Sinclair.  EA Officials are still wondering why HE
was selected.  (There is a reason.)
<P>
     That post was previously designed to either include representing Earth as
an ambassador (to avoid in-station conflicts) or as an adjunct to one. And at
one point, an ambassador will arrive, and they will hash this out once and for
all.
<P>
     What you have picked up on are not flaws, but story points in the
making...areas that will be explored down the road.  These questions WILL be
answered.  It would have been very easy to make him Admiral or Ambassador
Sinclair.  He was given this lower rank for a reason...and there are an awful
lot of people who look at this, and wonder if Sinclair isn't just a *tad* too
cozy with their former enemies in the war, and just where ARE his loyalties.
*really*?
<P><HR><P>
     Is it a conflict of interest...yes and no.  Sinclair functions much as a
military governor in, for instance, California's past.  Someone in this
position may speak on behalf of his government with neighboring countrires,
and represent others.  Does it sometimes lead into a conflict of interest?
Yes.  Is it sometimes unfair?  Yes.  Which is kinda like life, and that's why
I rather like putting him in an awkward position.
