     Re: time per scene rendering...you have to understand that the Toasters
render 24 hours a day.  Ron et al set 'em going before they leave for the
night, and the next morning come in to pick up the finished scene.  So you can
do a LOT of CGI in the course of a week.  Generally several minutes of new
stuff per week...and yes, that includes long, panning shots.  Trust me.
there's a LOT of CGI in just about every episode of the series.  A couple of
character-based stories are light, but they're more than compensated for in
heavy-CGI stories like "Midnight," "Sky," and "Raiding Party," to name a few.

     Here's a thought to conjure with.  It takes about an hour to render a CGI
frame that's very complex; 45 minutes if it's not terribly complex.   With the
new Screamer, we can cut down that time by about half, so that a highly
complex scene can be rendered in 15-30 minutes.  Average length for a CGI
scene is about 60 frames, so figure 30 hours.  You can do a full show's worth
of CGI in about a week, give or take.

     Today we turn over the raw footage for a special scene that'll be in one
of our episodes.  (Several scenes, actually, in the same episode.)   Ron's
elves will be rendering 24 hours a day (on automatic at night) for the next
THREE WEEKS to do something very special with this episode.  If it's done
right, it won't really draw attention to itself, it'll just be very, very
cool.
