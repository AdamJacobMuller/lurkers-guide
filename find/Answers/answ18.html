     As for "season finale cliffhangers," that depends on how you define that.
If you mean a cliffhanger that, once resolved at the start of the next season.
ends up having been more or less meaningless...no, we won't be doing that. But
the end of each planned season will make a left turn designed to bring the
show in new directions that will have long-erm (or long-term) effects on all
of our characters.

     Whether it's a chapter ending in a book, or an act break in a TV series.
you build to a moment of change and transition, upping the stakes at each
turn.  That's how our season-enders are constructed.

     RE: cliffhangers...not between episodes, certainly.  Between seasons.
it's...hard to explain.  There are, or will be *changes* that happen from one
season to another (as planned), specific events that take place that should
bring one up short...but "cliffhanger" in the sense of leaving some guy
hanging from a string over a lake of fire...no, no plans for such at this
time.
