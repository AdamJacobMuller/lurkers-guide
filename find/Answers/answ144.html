     Also, Ron did *substantial* modifications to the B5 station itself.
making it the biggest single object to render.  It has something like (and
this is only my memory) 100 times the resolution of the station used in the
pilot, so you can get right in close for paint-scraper shots.  It's much more
detailed and substantial looking.

     Not necessarily...it may have been 100-times in resolution, or it may
have been 1000-times in resolution...actually, as I think of it (via the fog
that's in my head) I think you're right...I knew there was a 1 and some 0s
involved in it...and it was a big deal...so maybe it *was* 1,000x.
