<H2>   Will there be a gay character?  When will we meet this character?</H2>
<P>
     (And at one point, we'll introduce a character -- assuming we haven't
already -- who will be around for quite some time, and then we'll just drop.
quite casually, that the character is gay.  I think that this is much better
than doing A Gay Story.  Just drop it in and move on.)

     To give that information out now would defeat the dynamic of its
revelation.  There's some stuff I can talk about, some that I can't.  That is
one of them.
<P>
     And how do you know you haven't already seen this character?
<P><HR><P>
     Let me put this as simply as I can...in the year 2258, nobody *cares*
about your sexual orientation.  It doesn't come up.  No one makes an issue out
of it.  There are no discussions, no proclamations, no inquiries, no "how will
they react?"  It's like being left-handed or right-handed; no one really cares
one way or another.
<P>
     Can we now move on past all of this?
