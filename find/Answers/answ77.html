     The fighters enter via the main docking bay, where they are shunted back
into the Starfury launch bays.  (BTW, for those who've asked, and let it never
be said that we're unresponsive...we asked Ron to develop a CGI sequence that
shows how ships get from the interior of the main docking bay down to the
customs and loading bays.  I've seen it, and it looks pretty spiffy.  Look for
it in "Grail."
