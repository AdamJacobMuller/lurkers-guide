     Yeah, we do a LOT of ships this season.  I have gifs of them all, and
some of them are mind-bogglingly nifty.  What I like about Ron's work is that
many of the space shots are works of art you could practically frame.  And
he's done one very important thing: he's brought COLOR into space, in a big
way.  Ships are personalized, painted, textured and made into things you enjoy
looking at.  The Starfury nicknamed the Sea Witch is a great example of
this...as well as a bunch of others.

     Not all Starfuries are the same, btw...you'll be seeing a different
category of them in "Mind War," and they're gorgeous.  Also very scary.   Not
as scary, but more nifty, are the ones in "Survivors" and "Chrysalis."

     Ah LOVES spaceships....

     There are other kinds of fighters; it's a question of what's intended for
use where.  The Raider ships, and the Narn heavy fighters, are both
atmospheric and non-atmospheric ships.  Some fighters, such as B5's
Starfuries, the Drazi Sunhawk, the Ipsha Battleglobe and others (you'll see
the latter two in "Deathwalker") are configured only for non-atmosphere
activities, and have different configurations.

     On the ships...when Ron was pulling together the ships for that episode.
we talked about it on the phone for a while, and I have to take the rap for
the saucers...which I still think are cool.  I said, in essence, why the hell
not?  Ron thought it was a great idea, and went and made it real.  I think if
we ever see this kind of ship again, it'll need some more work, a little more
weight and substance, some more detail, but they're okay.
