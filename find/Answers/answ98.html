<H2>   How do you tie religion into the story??</H2>
<P>
     Let me just lay the foundation here for a moment in the area of religion
and Babylon 5.  I'm an atheist, that simple.  But that's me.  If you look at
the long history of human society, religion -- whether you describe that as
organized, disorganized, or the various degrees of accepted superstition --
has always been present.  And it will be present 200 years from now.  That may
not thrill me, but when one is a writer, one must deal with realities, and
that's one of them.  To totally ignore that part of the human equation would
be as false and wrong-headed as ignoring the fact that people get mad, or
passionate, or strive for better lives.
<P>
     So we do deal with the questions of religion, and spirituality, and their
definitions, without being abusive.  A couple of stories on this area, like
David Gerrold's "Believers" may be very controversial.  On the other hand, my
script for "The Parliament of Dreams" is a straight-ahead showcase, in which
every species on B5 is encouraged to demonstrate his or her dominant belief
system, as practiced back home.  So we learn more about Minbari religion, more
about the Centauri's rather Bacchanallian form of religion, along with others.
And Sinclair is put in the difficult position of being asked to show what
Earth's dominant belief system is. The solution to which is, I think, kinda
cool.

     In the Babylon 5 universe, all the things that make us human -- our
obsessions, our interests, our language, our culture, our flaws and our
wonderfulnesses -- are all still intact.

     Yes, Earth religions have had to come to grips with the existence of
alien cultures; and religions from both sides have filtered into human an
alien life.  We won't be dealing with that this season because we deal with
the topic of religion a lot this season, and don't want to get too bogged down
with it.

     Garibaldi is an agnostic.  Ivanova is jewish.  Sinclair was raised
catholic and underwent training as a Jesuit.  Dr. Franklin is a Foundationist.
Catherine Sakai is buddhist.

     What kind of Jewish Ivanova is...is something she's trying to resolve in
her own head.

     The Foundation is a new religion, started close to the year 2000, which
gradually grew and achieved a fair amount of respectability over the following
200 years (as with mormonism, for instance).

     Great Maker is a term for the creator or god that has currency among many
different races.  Its origins are lost in history.
