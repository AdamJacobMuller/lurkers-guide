<H2>   What will the first season be like? What kinds of things will happen?</H2>
<P>
     So far, this season you'll learn a lot about all the cultures of our
ambassadors, especially the Big Four; you'll see the League of Non-Aligned
Worlds in action; you'll learn a LOT about the Psi Corps, Earth government and
economics, the inner workings of Babylon 5, the history of the Babylon
project, Sinclair's background (also a lot about Ivanova's and Garibaldi's
past)...you'll see a darker side of Londo, a lighter side of G'Kar, a more
ambiguous side of Delenn, some very weird sides of Kosh...and you'll come away
with a real sense of B5 as a *place*, a habitat, where things are, what they
do, how it works.  There will be an awful lot of action, and an even greater
amount of humor...there are parts of the show that, even having seen them 16
times, are still fall-down funny.
<P>
     Other than that...not much to say.
<P><HR><P>
     Since Mike mentioned it...yes.  "Babylon Squared" answers the B4
question...though posing new questions about *why*.  Basically, every question
we ask going into the first season we will answer, because I don't think it's
right or fair or smart to keep people hanging around 3 years to get a simple
answer to a simple question.  Season 1 of B5 is what I generally call the
"what" season...you find out WHAT the Psi Corps is, WHAT happened at the
Battle of the Line, WHAT happened to Babylon 4, and so on...whereas Season 2
is the "why" season...WHY did that happen to Sinclair?  And so on. New
questions arise, and we proide new answers, generally within the course of the
following season, but while at all times making sure that each episode stands
alone, regardless of where and which season you enter the series as a viewer.
<P>
     (It's kinda like being one of those guys on the old Ed Sullivan show.
spinning plates on top of long, thin rods...there's a LOT to keep in motion at
all times.)
<P>
     I'd classify the pilot movie as "who."
<P><HR><P>
     Season one will generally answer 90% of the questions raised in season
one; season two will answer the remaining 10%, and answer 90% of the questions
raised in season two...and so on.  There will not be a sense of unfulfilled
waiting.
<P><HR><P>
     You will find out what happened to Sinclair, for starters, during the
Earth/Minbari war.  In that respect, the pilot movie is like the first chapter
of a novel.  For nearly 10 years, Sinclair has worked to convince himself that
nothing happened to him on the Line other than what seems to be the case: that
he blacked out for 24 hours.  He's just managed to convince himself of this.
Now, suddenly, someone comes into his life and with seven words -- you'll know
them when you hear them -- completely unravels the self-deception.  He knows
then that something DID happen to him, that someone DID mess with his
mind...and he is going to find out who, and why.
<P>
     This he will do.  And the ramifications of that discovery will have a
major influence on the series, on his relationships, and the future of not
only his character but many others.
<P>
     You will see what a Vorlon is...and what it represents.  And what it may
have to do with our own saga, and a hidden relationship to some of our other
characters (watch the reception scene carefully).  We'll discover that there
are MANY players in this game.
<P>
     One thing that separates this show from others is that on other shows.
very often you do things to them to make for interesting drama...you take them
prisoner, you make them kids, whatever...in this show, it's what's INSIDE the
characters that will pose the greatest problems...and the greatest
possibilities for drama.  Most every major character is either running to, or
away from something in their hearts, or their pasts, or their careers.
Garibaldi's past will catch up with him in a very difficult way that will
affect his role and make him a very different character for as much as a full
season, and have lasting effects thereafter.  Lyta will take part in a voyage
of discovery that will very much change her character.
<P>
     Some of the established empires will fall.  Some will rise.  Hopes and
fortunes will be alternately made or destroyed.  At least one major group not
yet known even to EXIST will make its presence known, but only gradually. Some
characters will fall from grace.  Others will make bargains whose full price
they do not understand...but will eventually come to realize, and regret.
<P>
     At the end of the first season, one character will undergo a major, MAJOR
change, which will start the show spinning on a very different axis. The first
season will have some fairly conventional stories, but others will start the
show gradually moving toward where I want it to go.   One has to set these
things up gradually.  Events in the story -- which is very much the story of
Jeffrey Sinclair -- will speed up in each subsequent season.
<P>
     Someone he considers a friend will betray him.  Another will prove to be
the exact opposite of what Sinclair believes to be true.  Some will live. Some
will die.  He will be put through a crucible of terrible force, that will
change him, and alter his destiny, in a profound and terrible way...if he goes
one way, or the other, will determine not only his own fate, but that of
millions of others.  He will grow, and become stronger, better, wiser...or be
destroyed by what fate is bringing his way.  In sum, it is a story of hope
against terrible adversity and overwhelming odds.
<P>
     That, in broad brush strokes, is a *taste* of what I plan to do with the
series.  I note this here because when the pilot airs, I am going to ask for
your continued help in supporting the endeavor for the series, and it occurs
to me that you ought to have at least SOME idea of what you're buying, and
being asked to support.  One should never be asked to sign a blank check on
the bank of one's conscience.
