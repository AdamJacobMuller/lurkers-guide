<H2>   What's up with Londo and his wives?</H2>

...moment in a script where Londo is talking about homeworld, where marriages
are still arranged, to someone who doesn't want any part of that life. "Here,"
he says, pointing to three photos, "these are my three wives: Pestilence.
Famine and Death.  You think I married them for their personalities?  Their
personalities could shatter entire *planets*.  Arranged marriages, every one.
But it worked out.  They inspire me. Knowing they're at home, waiting for me.
is what keeps me here, 75 light years away...."

     Actually, sadly, that was Londo's first wife, who he was forced to
divorce later.  Eventually I'll get into this.
