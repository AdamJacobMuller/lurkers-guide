     The time for prep on year two, if we were to get picked up, would be
equal to year one, with the exception that we won't have to build all of these
sets.  We'll have more time in that sense.  Again, the stories are pretty much
mapped out for five years, so that's already done.

     P.S.  So far the first 3-4 episodes of B5's second season are in
real-time order, each separated by a week in story-time as well as in real
time.  It begins a few days into 2259, and the season would end just before
the end of that year, with season three starting in 2260.
