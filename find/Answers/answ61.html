     I would not describe n'grath as a "Mafia boss," since that's a very
specific term.  Nor is it really any kind of organization.  He's a fixer.
somebody you go to when you need something...a bodyguard, forged identicards.

     Garibaldi is quite aware of n'grath...and knowing that if he just

knows to the trouble he'd have to track down.
