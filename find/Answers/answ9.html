     Just recently, btw, I gave Larry DiTillio a printout with just a little
of the coming 5 year arc...if he's going to story edit, he needs to know what
lines not to cross, and I can't ride herd on that all the time.  He took it
home, read it.  Called me.  Didn't even say hello.   Began the conversation
with, "You are out of your f'ing mind."  I asked for some small clarification
of his position.  He indicated that he thought it was absolutely great.
something that'll really go down in the rolls when the final tally is done.
"But you GOT to be out of your f'ing mind to try and pull something like this
off.  It *can* be done...but it takes a lunatic to do it."

     Sounds about right.

     Kiwi...understand that no changes are just made willy-nilly (to use your
term).  This is a STORY.  As with any story, any novel, you have your moments
of surprise, of sudden turns where you kick over all of the tables and watch
the pieces scatter.  But the writer already knows where the pieces will land.
It's all according to plan.  Nobody's going to be screwed over.  Anymore than
when somebody reading, say, a Stephen King book feels screwed over when
suddenly Salem's Lot, a nice quiet little town, suddenly gets filled with
undead and characters are suddenly going through some remarkable
changes...it's all part of the story.
