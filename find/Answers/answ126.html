     Unrelated to anything that's preceded (thank goodness), here's a little
something for consideration...thoughts to conjure with, when it comes to our
season-ending episode/cliffhanger.
<P>
     On Power, leaving out the things that unnerved people too much to let me
do, I was still able, in the final episode/cliffhanger of that first season.
to destroy the protagonist's base of operations totally and completely and
beyond recall, set up a major change in the antagonist's appearance (the final
mechanized stages of Lyman Taggert), eliminate all or nearly all of our
Jonathan Power's supply lines and support personnel, totally turn around the
direction of the show, and kill one major regular character.
<P>
     So if that's what happens on a show where I'm not allowed full reign to
do *everything* want...stop to consider for a moment what happens when there's
no one to stop me from going all the way....
<P>
     "Chrysalis" is going to be one heck of an episode....
<P><HR><P>
     I have just seen the director's cut of "Chrysalis," which will be the
last episode of this season...and I think it has just displaced "Sky" as the
most heavy-weight episode of the season.  Even knowing what was coming, I just
sat here, stunned, at the end of it.  Seeing dailies, bits and pieces, doesn't
really prepare you for the whole thing.
<P>
     What I like most about it are two things: one, by about halfway in, you
really begin to understand that anything can happen, to anyone, and the rules
that normally carry you through a television episode no longer apply.  It's a
very dangerous, dislocating feeling.  Two: you get the very real feeling that.
after this episode, nothing is the same anymore.  The show has taken a very
profound and *irrevocable* turn that will have lasting effects on all of our
characters.  Of all the episodes so far, this one has the most feeling of
being the chapter end in a novel.
<P>
     The really hard part will not avoiding the temptation to show this to
people...because it really can't be allowed to get out prior to airing. There
are too many twists and turns and revelations that spin one off into another.
<P>
     One other thing's certain: after you've seen "Chrysalis," you're going to
want to go back and check out three prior episodes...because something that
you will have read/interpreted one way, without question or hesitation
accepting it as what it obviously appears to be, will suddenly be turned on
its head, and a brand new interpretation will emerge.  And it's *real*
creepy....
<P><HR><P>
     Re: the Oliver Stone thing...that's a comment made during the edit on
"Chrysalis" as well.  I'm dying to see how people will react to what's done
and revealed and advanced in that episode, but we have to sit on it; though
we'll be mixing and finishing it in the next few weeks, we won't be turning it
over to PTEN until shortly before airdate, because we don't want this getting
all over town.  There's not a single major character who's not profoundly
affected...or strongly set up for profound changes in the very near future.
<P>
     I love it...it's my favorite of the season, without question.
<P><HR><P>
     I give y'all a little gift...Kosh's very last line of the season, in
"Chrysalis."
<P>
     "You have...forgotten something."
<P>
     It's not nearly as straightforward as it looks, and that one line will
carry with it *major* repercussions.  (And no, it doesn't refer to the 24
hours.)
<P><HR><P>
     I am *not* teasing.
<P>
     Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go watch "Chrysalis" again.
<P>
