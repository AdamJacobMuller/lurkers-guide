     Re: B5's roster of strong women characters...this is something of a
bugaboo/obsession with me.  I *love* writing strong women.  (For that matter.
I love strong-willed, independent, smart women in real life as well; I love
being outsmarted, love it when someone can go toe-to-toe with me on
something.)  Generally, and this isn't entirely intentional, women on shows I
work on tend to get some of the best lines, as is often the case with Ivanova.
It's not a case of being "one of the boys," but being one of the *people*.
There's a subtle difference.
<P>
     The women I write are often very close to many of the women I've been
involved with over the years.  So far, no one's sued....
