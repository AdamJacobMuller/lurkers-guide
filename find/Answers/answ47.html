     Regarding Garibaldi...in the first hour-script that I've turned in, we do
learn more about his past, and what brought him here.  And yes, there were
some lives involved, but he was framed.  Doesn't mean he didn't screw up other
things...and doesn't mean he won't screw up NOW, either.  He's had a problem
with alcohol, and it may come back.  But there is a strong link to Sinclair
that prompted him to give Garibaldi what is, essentially, his last chance.

     Brett: this isn't a case of jack-of-all-trades.  Garibaldi *has* to be a
qualified fighter pilot as head of security of a *space station* where
problems can come up in the space surrounding the station.  Also, as mentioned
here before (I think) and certainly in one of our scripts, during the period
between Garibaldi's last security job, and now, when eh (he) couldn't get a
job as security chief, he was a pilot, running transport shuttles on a couple
of ice mining operations.  (It was not a good period for him.)  Nothing is
done arbitrarily with these characters.   All three of our main EA characters
-- Sinclair, Garibaldi and Ivanova -- are qualified fighter and transport
pilots.
