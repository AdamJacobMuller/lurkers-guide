<H2>   Who funded the Babylon projects?</H2>
<P>
     The Earth Alliance funded the first few attempts exclusively; after
they'd dumped all their money into B4, they needed outside funding to get B5
going, and the Minbari were first to contribute money as a show of good faith.
Then the Centauri added additional funding.  Those are the only two other
races that've contributed significantly.
