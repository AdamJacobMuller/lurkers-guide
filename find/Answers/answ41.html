     Actually, there are varying religions within the alien species as well;
G'Kar is a follower of G'Quan, while Na'Toth's father followed G'Lan, and
Na'Toth herself doesn't really believe in anything (this as noted in "By Any
Means Necessary").  So that diversity isn't strictly or exclusively human.
