     Babylon 5 was conceived in 1986; the screenplay for the pilot (which was
more or less what was shot) was written in 1987.  Also in 1987, art was
commissioned and used to help in pitches to networks and studios.  The full
project -- artwork, screenplay, series bible, treatment and sample stories --
was shopped to several places, including Paramount in 1989.

     The first notes and drafts on Babylon 5 go back to 1976. though the first
script wasn't finished until 1977/78.
