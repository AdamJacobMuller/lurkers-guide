     Interesting, innit, how they suddenly blossomed like that...?

     The whole telepathy issue is an interesting one in the universe of B5.
There have always been attempts to prove the existence of telepathy, but in
general the findings have been inconclusive.  But about 125 years or so ago in
B5's timeline (2100-2110 and thereabouts) the findings began suddenly to tilt.
and full-blown telepaths began to be discovered.  There were some abortive and
confused attempts to legislate around this, most of which failed or were
overturned in various courts of law.  About 2150 or so, the government
agencies that regulated and oversaw telepaths were rolled over into the newly
established Psi Corps, which became a clearing house for locating.
controlling, and licensing telepaths for commercial, some very restricted
legal, and military purposes.
