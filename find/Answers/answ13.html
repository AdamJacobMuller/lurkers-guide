<H2>   Why "Babylon 5"?</H2>
<P>
     Thing is, Babylon has become a myth that can be interpreted and
re-interpreted a zillion ways, and can't be unmentioned forever because of one
of those interpretations.  That's why the name has come up more times than I
want to think about, in song and story.  (Remember the song "Babylon," by, I
believe, Donovan?)  We did a titles search before we began production, and the
title Babylon 1 has been used 4 times, Babylon 2 has been used twice, Babylon
3 appears in a copyrighted song title, and Babylon 4 has also been used
(though neither copyrighted nor trademarked, so we've taken that step). Which
also goes to Somtow using a Babylon 5 in his story.  It's a name that merits
lots of re-interpretations.

     And here's a little something to consider.  Some have noted the location
of B5's namesake, it's proximity to the Tigres and Euphrates, that sort of
thing...speculated on other aspects of the show...but much of what you need to
know about what will eventually happen in the course of the B5 story arc is
already available to you.  In any decent desk encyclopedia.

     What, you thought I pulled the name Babylon out of a hat?  Let's just say
that there are going to be some interesting historical parallels....

     You have to really dig to get any good material on Babylon; it's not a
big topic among commercial publishers, you really have to go for the academic
publishing houses.  (Beware of religious publishing houses in this area; they
have their own spin on things that tends to infect the text.)

     Ancient Babylon kind of began with a good idea, to form a central
location for business, commerce, trading...and gradually went downhill from
there.  The *idea* was solid, and that was the goal of the Babylon
project...to form a place, a freeport, of trading, where cultures could come
together.  And it sounded exotic.  Naturally, no one expects Babylon 5 to go
the way of the original Babylon....

     After all, we're *so* much smarter now.
