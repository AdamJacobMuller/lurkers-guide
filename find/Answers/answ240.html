<H2>   What do you get from hanging out in the Babylon 5 newsgroup?</H2>
<P>
     What do I get from the newsgroup?  A "sense of the room," primarily, I
suppose.  And knowing that someone's looking over your shoulder, and that this
person is *right in your face*, and you can't avoid it, and you will havae to
answer hard questions if you screw up, tends to keep you honest.  One can hide
behind isolation.  One of the problems in TV is that if you get to a position
high enough, lots of people around you start saying everything's just
wonderful, you get "yes-men" and nobody tells you the truth anymore.  I don't
think I have that problem here.  If anything, it's just the opposite; because
I expect criticism...or, more accurately, because people *expect* that I
expect criticism, that critiques are expected of them, there's MORE of it than
on the systems where I lurk and my presence isn't generally known.
<P>
     Beyond that...I've always felt that SF fans, particular SF media fans.
are the most exploited group of viewers around.  They're expected to watch the
show, pony up the dough for merchandise, then shut up and be good little
viewers.  It's very difficult at times -- emotionally, and in terms of time
and energy -- to stick around (there are currently 1,154 messages in my GEnie
internet mailbox), but I think that it's important to keep with it.  Because
it's a way of showing respect to the viewer, to be open and accountable and
responsive.  Sometimes I get cranky, but I'm human, and that'll happen from
time to time.  Usually I avoid that.
<P>
     It just seems the courteous and proper thing to do.  Does that make ANY
kind of sense to anybody...?

     Best thing about the net is that it forces you to ask questions.  The job
of the writer is to come up with every possible question about your character
and your world, and answer it, giving both greater verasimilitude.  But nobody
can come up with EVERY conceivable question; but on the nets, you get
questions you never *dreamed* of.  Which helps.
<P><HR><P>
     Well, now, lemme defend the Internet for a second...what I find most
interesting about it is that most of the Internet stuff comes in via major
colleges, universities, research labs and the like.  So when you're dealing
with a lot of people of college age, you're going to encounter rough spots.
BUT...what you *also* get are people who are pretty sharp, have access to
research material, are academics and scientists and research students...and
lemme tell you, they keep you on your toes.
<P>
     It's easy to hang out in a room where people are generally nice to
you...and certainly relaxing; I tend to come here more with a sense of
relaxing with friends, where there is some measure of "put up the persona and
perform" on Internet...but one should be open to the tough stuff as well.
Granted, at times it makes me cranky, and I probably respond with more heat
than I'd like...but again, that's really more the exception than the rule.
There's a lot of nifty people there.

     "And jms seems to be doing just fine...right, Joe?"
<P>
     Yeah...absolutely...fine...look, hand me those crayons, okay...though I
don't know why...the black one's all flat and you can't make good lines with
it and they won't let me sharpen it because the last time I used the sharpener
I put Nurse Filbee's finger in it but that wasn't my fault, she pointed it at
me, so if I just have the crayons, the ones with the good points, I can get
this done, get this done, on deadline, the deadlines are important, do you
like the peach color or the green for the rabbit...?
<P>
     What was the question again?
