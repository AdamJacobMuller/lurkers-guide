<H2>   Has Earth been in other wars besides the Minbari war?</H2>
<P>
     Earth has fougth in some other conflicts, on a smaller scale; prior to
the Earth/Minbari war, they came to the assistance of the Non-Aligned Worlds
against a race known as the Dilgar, which devastated whole worlds.

     The Dilgar War was one of the first conflicts that the EA got into, soon
after establishing a presence in space.  We mainly entered it to try and make
a "rep" for ourselves, then got more morally involved when we saw what was
going on.  That and the Minbari War are the only real major conflicts Earth
has been involved with, and Earth was not directly at risk in the Dilgar war.
though if they hadn't been stopped, that might have changed eventually.
