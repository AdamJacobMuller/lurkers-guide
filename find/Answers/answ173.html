<P>
     The teasers and promos are put together by the Warner Bros. marketing and
promotions department.

     I have nothing to do with the trailers, except to sit in awe and
astonishment, trying to recognize my episode in the trailer, which is a chancy
business at best.

     Warners sometimes feels the need to "enhance" the shows through the
promos...and sometimes they enhance them right into an alternate dimension....

     We're trying to get Warners to re-evaluate their approach to the teasers.
