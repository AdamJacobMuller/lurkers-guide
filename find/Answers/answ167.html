     What do I do exactly?  Aside from writing my own scripts, I assign
stories to other writers, and select those writers to work with.  (Because B5
is tied to a story arc, many of our freelance scripts are based upon assigned
stories.)  I'm also involved in every single stage of the series production:
minus any notes from the studio (which are minimal, our last project got no
notes at all, they're leaving us very much alone), Doug and I have final say
over jevery aspect of the series.  (Generally Doug is more the businessman and
deal maker, leaving most of the creative details to me.)  I do casting, work
with the art directors on graphics, approve and work with the set designers.
wardrobe people, prosthetics team, computer graphics team, visual effects.
every single department.  I get final say on the editing of the shows.
mussound effects, you name it.
