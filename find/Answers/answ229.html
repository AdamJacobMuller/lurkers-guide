        into writing?

     I've always found "how/when did you get your break into writing" to be a
very weird question, at least in my case; like asking a doctor, "when did you
get your break into foot surgery."  It wasn't one thing at one time.  This is
a career that I've prepared for, and worked toward, and entered incrementally
over a very long period.  I always knew that I would be a writer, used to
collect pencils and paperclips and could determine the better grade of erasers
and #10 pencils at an age when most kids were still trying to figure out which
end to hold.  It's just a quirk.

     When I was 16, after having read comprehensively in every genre I could
get my hands on, I decided that now was a good time to start.  So I began
writing.  Short stories, poems, playlets, articles, you name it, I wrote it. I
didn't show anyone at first, just kept slamming words together in the process
of learning how to make little explosions of character and action. When I felt
ready -- six months later -- I began showing it around.  The high school I was
attending began producing some of my one-acts, and commissioned a full play
from me; I began selling articles to local newspapers and magazines; even
placed a one-act with a local theater, which decided to produce it before
discovering that I was only 17 years old.  (When I showed up, they kept
waiting for my parents to arrive, until I pointed out that *I* was the JMS on
the script.)
<P>
     After that, it was just a process of *writing* and *sending it out*.
There is no mystery, no big break, no sudden revelation or secret handshake.
Bit by bit, I sold more articles, sold more plays, sold some short stories.
and bit by bit, almost without noticing, the list of credits got longer until
one day, people started asking me when I knew I'd Made It as a writer, when it
hadn't ever occured to me that I *had* made it as a writer...I hadn't realized
it'd happened.
<P>
     It's the difference, I suppose, between buying a finished house, and
there it is...and watching the house go up brick by brick over a long period
of time.  At what point did it "become" a house?
<P>
     It's probably not a helpful answer, but it's the only one I have....

     Tolkien's work had a *profound* effect on me in college; as I later read
all of the background material, the reams and reams of "history" that he wrote
to background his novels, I began to realize that *that's* the way to do it.
So I tried to take that kind of approach, filling out as much as humanly
possible about the universe, characters and history.  It's the only really
sensible way to tackle something this large.
