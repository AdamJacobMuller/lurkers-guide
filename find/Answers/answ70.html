     The station was designed to rotate mainly because it's scientifically
accurate.  Afterward, we realized that, as you suggest, it *does* give the
station a very dynamic look.  Which only proves the point that if you take the
time to actually do things correctly, to answer the next question, it works
FOR you, not against you.
