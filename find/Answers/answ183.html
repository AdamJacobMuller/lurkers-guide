     Re: the shape of the doors...they're set to notch into the wall, and in
the case of depressurization, bolts shoot through the "teeth" that insert into
the wall, to lock it securely into place.  It's much more airtight that way
than a conventional door that swings or opens in the middle in case of an
accident that opens a portion of the station to vacuum.
