     No, the closest parallel to the Centauri would, I suppose, be ancient
Rome.  I tend not to go that much to contemporary sources for metaphor, since
it's too obvious and over-done.  Much of what's in B5 is drawn from much older
sources.  The only exception, the only means of creating a metaphor for the
present, is one that will take some time before it's even perceptible, though
by the end of the season, you'll see what it is pretty clearly.
