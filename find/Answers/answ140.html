     Actually, thus far, nearly everyone on our crew has appeared in the
background of one episode or another, except for me.  Which is the way I like
it....

     Nope, I don't do cameos; for me, it ruins the illusion.

     As a matter of fact, in a couple of episodes you'll see a photo of the
Earth Alliance president.  The photo itself is of Doug Netter, my associate on
the show and fellow executive producer.  (The woman running against the
incumbent president in the election featured on "Midnight" is played, in
photo, by our wardrobe designer, Ann Bruice.)
