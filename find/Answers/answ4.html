<H2>   How is the B5 story going to be told?  If B5 is a five-year arc,</H2>
        will I miss out if I miss some episodes?
<P>
     I've constructed the B5 writing scenario more or less as follows:
<P>
     1) Each episode will be able to stand alone.  If you come in on season
two, without having seen anything else, you'll be able to get into it.
<P>
     2) Questions asked in the course of an episode or a season will be
answered in that episode or season.
<P>
     3) BUT...if you continue to watch the show, then over time a story writ
on a much larger scale will begin to emerge.  Consider it like a triptych,
something out of Hieronymous Bosch...each individual panel is sufficient unto
itself, but put them all together, and suddenly you see connections and a
whole picture that wasn't there a moment earlier.
<P>
     Relationships will change.  People will live, and die.  Alliances wll
shift.  And at one point or another, everything you THINK you know about these
characters will be turned upside down.
<P><HR><P>
     You have to understand the way this show is going to be structured. There
aren't going generally going to be a lot of loose threads hanging around.
Episodes will resolve themselves.  It's just that, from time to time, we'll
carom off some point that seems tangential, but which will later become
significant.  You don't have to watch every episode.  Hell, if I do this right
-- and this is one hell of a hat trick, lemme tell you, when it comes to
structure -- you can even watch them out of ORDER, within a season, and still
follow what's going on.  The trick is to make it so that if something slips
past, the viewer doesn't trip over it.  And when you do an episode that you've
set up before, that set-up should in some subtle, non-heavy-expository way, be
re-established for those who might not have seen the episode.
<P>
     Telling people "This is a five year arc" in a big way almost as a warning
is actually more destructive than constructive; it might lead people to think
that they need to commit five years of their lives to get the whole story, and
it's hard to get people to commit to even one ten-hour miniseries. You can
watch any part you want, and get a good, solid, independently enjoyable
hour-show out of it.  You can come in at any point you want.  The key is that
the more you watch, the more you will pick up on the nuances and the threads
we're going to be playing with.  Generally, we're going to keep those threads
a bit light in the first season, then begin to draw in more of the general
story arc in the second and subsequent seasons.  Let's use the first year to
get the audience comfortable with the B5 universe, and with our characters,
and in a handful of episodes, carefully begin leading everyone where we want
them to go, so that when we start to accellerate things in year two, those
who've been with us from the start can get right into it, and those who come
to the show late can play catch up without any problem.

     The 5 year arc is worked out in considerable detail; 200 single spaced
pages in a triple-encrypted file.
<P><HR><P>
     There is a five-year story arc, yes.  What's planned?  Cool stuff.
<P><HR><P>
     That said...I think the ending for the B5 storyline is pretty cool.
<P>
     That said...I don't think it's really about the ending.  The ending is
simply where the story finally stops.  Look at the ending of THE LORD OF THE
RINGS.  Frodo back in the shire (though not entirely the same shire it was
when he left), glad that it's all over.
<P><HR><P>
     Will you be satisfied by the ending?  More to the question, are you being
satisfied by the beginning, and the journey so far?  That's the more telling
question.  B5 is more about the journey than the destination, though you have
to craft one hell of a climax and a solid ending nonetheless.
<P><HR><P>
     I think maybe 45-50% of our subtext and allusions have been noted to
date, which is *real* good.
<P><HR><P>
     Actually, one follow-up...one thing we've been very careful about is that
when something is referenced in episode 9 that took place in episode 3, you
don't *have* to have seen episode 3 for it to make sense; the information you
need is collapsed or somehow incorporated into the dialogue in episode 9.
Meaning that while VCRs and repeated viewings and groups can help to *predict*
stuff, you don't need to have seen ANY prior episodes of the show to enjoy any
one episode of the show.
<P>
     But the *more* you watch, the more you get out of it.
