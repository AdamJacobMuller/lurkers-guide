<H2>   How do you envision medical technology?</H2>
<P>
     Our medical advisor tells us that regen technology should be well in hand
within the next 100 years, so you can grow back damaged internal organs and
the like, and avoid having to do transplants.  Also that the system of surgery
is moving toward non-invasive procedures, using light in more and different
ways.

     He went on past that, but there was some math involved...

     Re: the medical tools...we brought in a medical science consultant, who
helped us design our instruments.  His sense was that we're moving more and
more toward light as a system of treatment, non-invasive procedures, that sort
of thing.  No, there aren't anything like those devices in today's operating
rooms...but this is 250 years from now.  In any event, it *is* based on the
latest info we're getting on new science from our medical advisor.
