     For the most part, lower level types don't know the names of those in the
Grey Council (speaking of Minbari for a moment).  They are kept fairly
anonymous to avoid the cult of personality arising.  You'll see the full
extent to which they preserve their anonymity in some of the upcoming
episodes, specifically "Sky" and "Babylon Squared."

     A little aside for you...at one point this season, Delenn goes to the
Grey Council.  There's a ritual she has to observe when she joins the ranks of
the Nine.  Part of it is this statement she makes upon entering the circle: "I
am Grey.  I stand between the candle, and the star.  We are Grey.  We stand
between the darkness, and the light."
