<H2>   How would you rate the success of the show?</H2>
<P>
     I'm not sure, from my perspective, that there's any one definition of
success that I'd use.  There are several:
<P>
     1) How much is the project in its final form what I conceived it to be?
This is something that Harlan keeps hammering home at me, pointing to what
happened to him on the Starlost by way of comparison...it was dreadful, and he
had to take his name off it. It's the show I wanted to make, made the way I
wanted to make it, so on that level, I'm content.
<P>
     2) The ratings.  Is what we conceived of interest to other people, or
have we missed the mark?  Television, like any other medium, is aimed at an
audience.  If the audience isn't there, then it comes down to "does the tree
make a noise when it falls in an empty forest?"  Whether it's good or bad
becomes nominally irrlevant.
<P>
     And 3) Whether or not anyone talks about the show, or remembers the show.
years down the road.  Something can get a lot of attention, critical acclaim.
ratings, be what the creators envisoned...and be gone in a year, the flavor of
the month.
<P>
     If I had to pick one, it'd be #3.  As an atheist, my sense is that one
achieves immortality by the effect one has on others.  If the show lives on
beyond me, then I am satisfied.  Twain observed: "If you want your work to
live forever...and by forever I mean fifty years...it must neither overtly
preach nor overtly teach...but it must *covertly* preach and *covertly*
teach."
