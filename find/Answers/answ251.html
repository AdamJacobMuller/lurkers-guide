      John Copeland, our producer, shows me something that John Iacovelli came
into the office bearing...a B5 cap.  It's a very nice Babylon 5 cap.
Stitching's a little off, though, I notice...not bad, but noticeable.  I learn
it's commercially available.  Well, still and all, not a bad thing, I decide,
trying to figure out why John's smiling at me in this really weird fashion.
People have been asking for B5 caps, and now they can buy them through, it
seems, Creation Entertainment, as this was bought at a Creation store in
Glendale (Sci-Fi Universe), and it's a Creation produced item, under their
license....
<P>
      Then the tag hanging from the back of the cap slips out into my hand,
dangling from that little white-plastic-string-thingie they stick through
labels.
<P>
      And what does the label on that white-plastic-string-thingie say?

      OFFICIAL LICENSED PRODUCT, PARAMOUNT TELEVISION.

      We never get a break...never...ever...the horror...the horror....
