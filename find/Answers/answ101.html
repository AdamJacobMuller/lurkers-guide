        the series?

     While we will not be *seeing* much of Earth in B5 (as in going there).
what's going on back home will be a *constant* undercurrent to the series.
You'll learn a lot about the state of Earth in 2258 in our universe during the
course of the series.
<P><HR><P>
     Actually, my plan is to show a *lot* of what's happening back on Earth.
because that will tie into what happens on B5.  Social changes, politics.
religion, sports...again, this relates to one of the themes of B5 from my
point of view, the continuance of our species,the thread that connects our
past, our present and our future.  And again, that's something that'll become
fairly evident from episode one on.
<P><HR><P>
     The questions concerned B5 and the political situation on Earth at this
time.  Back home, there is an Earth Senate, which is made up of elected
representatives from each nation-state; the larger and more powerful the
nation, the more reps they get.  Which annoys the smaller nations no end. (And
there's quite a bit of conflict between them; the smaller nation-states, with
limited resources, keep grousing about why they should support B5 financially.
as well as other space endeavors, when their economy really isn't set up to
take as much advantage of the situation as the larger nation-states.
<P><HR><P>
     The Earth government -- located in Earthdome -- is basically a republic,
with reps from each nation serving as senators or in other capacities.
<P><HR><P>
     Earthdome is on Earth.  In what used to be Geneva.
<P><HR><P>
     And of course there still *are* conflicts between Earth countries at the
time of B5.  Including conflicts over space.  In a news broadcast featured
prominently in the upcoming two-parter, because of another item in the
broadcast that's important for that episode, it's noted that the
representatives in Earthdome from several countries have pulled out in protest
on the grounds that since they do not benefit equally from the exploitation of
space, they should not be expected or required to help pay for it on an equal
basis as everyone else.
