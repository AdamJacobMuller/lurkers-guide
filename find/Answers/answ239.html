<H2>   Are you still keeping up with the online community?</H2>
<P>
     Yes, I try to log on here about once a day, and though it's getting
tougher, I still read through *all* the messages in this area, though at times
I skim a bit.  From my perspective, I try not to get in the way of the
discussion, by either encouraging or discouraging positive or negative
comments.  If I think someone is being unfair, or is just coming in to lob in
a firecracker, watch everyone scatter and yell, and then run away (as the
occasional spineless mindfucker among us is wont to do), I either fire back.
or simply ignore the post.
<P>
     The one major reason I decided to begin this interaction, despite
CONSIDERABLE discourgement and disbelief from my peers, is that I think it may
be of some use, and because I think that one should be willing to stand
publicly with what you create, and because though many criticisms are issues
of taste or subjective preference, sometimes (fairly often, actually), I learn
something from the discussion, or I'm corrected in something, and that
realignment is eventually reflected in the show.  I'm giving some serious
thought to either revamping n'grath or killing him off given the reaction
(paired with my own).  I won't be dictated to, but in some cases, as with
n'grath, I may be uncertain, but willing to try and see if the experiment
works.  Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't, and the general perception
here seems close to my own.  In addition, I was initially going to gloss over
some of the legal aspects of the Psi Corps in "The Quality of Mercy," but when
so many people expressed interest in how that worked, and when I saw some
measure of confusion about it, I took the time to indicate how the legal
aspects work when it came time to complete that script, thus answering the
questions.
<P>
     Sure, there've been more hostile or abusive or insulting messages posted
here, primarily to get a reaction...I've seen that game before, and I'm
neither impressed nor annoyed.  The general level of the discussion -- pro AND
con -- is still generally of a high level, and quite revealing.  The
experiment continues.
<P><HR><P>
     BTW...someone dropped me an email note mentioning in passing that
somewhere else there's a discussion going on about *this* discussion, and
indicating that my presence here inhibits criticism of B5.
<P>
     First, if I believed that, I wouldn't be here.  Second...it ain't true.
<P>
     Along with logging on here and on a number of other systems under my own
name, there are a few BBSs -- regional and national -- which have B5
discussions giong on where I also hang out...but either under a pseudonym, or
without leaving messages, thus no one knows I'm lurking.  I do this in order
to get an unbiased view of the show, without my presence affecting the
discussion one way or another.  Call it a control group, if you will.
<P>
     And on those forums where I'm not known to be there, what you get are
generally "I liked it" or "I didn't like it," about as broad as that.   Very
little of the (to use the phrase of others) nits and detailed analyses that go
on on the systems where I *am* known to hang out.  Since there's a conduit for
direct feedback to the show, people here and on the other services where I'm
on as myself tend to provide MORE criticism of the show, not less.  In some
cases, the occasional person may feel that he HAS to find something to nit at.
because there is the implicit request for feedback.
<P>
     Nor do I try to get in the way of negative feedback; if I think that
someone is getting personal in an attack, or making an unfair accusation, or
blaming me for something that the show never did...I fire back.  I try to
answer all questions as non-judgmentally as possible, and if someone asks if
something's going to be done, point to the forthcoming episode where it *is*
done.
<P>
     I don't try to change people's opinions here (I let the show do that).
don't try to intimidate people into silence (I don't think it's *possible* to
intimidate this particular group in *any* event), and I have a much lower
estimation for those who skulk off in dark corners to mutter their criticisms
of the discussion here than speak openly.  I'm insulted by the allegation, and
frankly think that anyone here who has been taking part in the discussion here
should feel insulted about being portrayed as spineless and toadying, which is
the implicit statement behind the allegation.
<P>
     If I *ever* got the impression that my presence here was inhibiting an
open discussion, inhibiting criticism, I'd log off.  But near as I can tell.
being here *encourages* criticism, in greater volume than elsewhere.  The day
that changes, I'm outta here.
<P>
