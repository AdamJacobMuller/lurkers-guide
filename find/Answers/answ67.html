<H2>   How big is the station?  What parts are there?</H2>
<P>
     The station is a touch over 5 miles long.  It can hold roughly 250,000
humans and aliens (many of whom are in transit at any point).
<P><HR><P>
     250,000 is the *maximum* number of beings who can be there at one time;
that's not necessarily the maximum number of living quarters.  In some ways.
B5 is like an airport; you come in, linger, then move on to your eventual
destiny (catching a few winks in the customs area waiting for the right ship
to come in or go out).
<P><HR><P>
     The blue fins at the back of B5 are, as I recall, for the purpose of
radiating internal heat out of and from B5.
<P><HR><P>
     The Starfuries are launched from the rotating part of the station.
They're launched from the cobra bays, which are the cobra shaped projections
alongside the round front of the station, and attached to it.
<P><HR><P>
     Many aliens (all who require alternate atmosphere) live in the alien
sector.  Those who can breathe oxygen can live in other areas, but tend to
congregate with other non-humans in the oxygen sections of the alien sector.
The ambassadors have their own environment supported quarters in the Green
Sector, which is the high-security area for diplomats.
<P><HR><P>
     The interior of the station does have some farm-land, orchards, an
open-air hedge maze, and other green areas.  We'll be seeing them in varying
degrees of detail throughout the series.  No specs are yet publicly available.
<P><HR><P>
     Located above the station proper is the long zero-g cargo loading area.
You'll see, in later episodes, ships pulling up in front of the area and
offloading cargo.  That is accessible from many parts of the station.
<P><HR><P>
     The zero-g cargo section extends from the front of B5 well into the
middle of the station, *inclusive* of red sector, which is below it.
<P><HR><P>
     The 2.5 million tons of spinning *metal* refers only to that part. the
metal casing.  It doesn't include the furniture, the structures. the Garden,
the 250,000 humans and aliens...so the total mass of the thing is MUCH greater
than the 2.5 megatons.  Also, the body was shoved out of the area around the
cargo bay, non-rotating, which would also cut down on the momentum (as opposed
to shoving out out of the rotating part, where it would speed away at 1g).
<P><HR><P>
     On the one hand...we have more interior sets than any other series that I
know of; 18 standing sets and 42 swing sets.  And we're building a number of
other sets for next year, including an Officer's Club.  In addition to C&C,
we've seen various holding cells, numerous quarters, a conference room,
Sinclair's briefing room, the Council Chambers, the business room, two
separate restaurants, the Zocalo, the Dark Star Club, the Casino, the Happy
Daze Bar, Doug's Dugout Sports Bar, the Ombuds Courtroom, various DownBelow
sectors...we've shown a *lot*.
<P><HR><P>
     Medlab is the smaller facility exclusively for Dr. Franklin, as Chief of
Staff.  There are larger medical facilities, more like proper hospitals,
elsewhere on the station.
<P><HR><P>
     The CO's office next season will have a view of the Garden area, as will
some other rooms.
