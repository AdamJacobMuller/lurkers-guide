<H2>   How did you and Babylon 5 come through the big 1994 earthquake?</H2>
<P>
     Came through pretty much okay, all considered.  At the house, the living
room fireplace is now IN the living room (on the floor), the patio has
separated from the rest of the house, there's major cracks all over the place.
everything that was on shelves is now on the floor...but the stage came
through okay, and we're back to shooting today, if possibly on a reduced
schedule.  (Everyone was given the option of not coming in today, but everyone
wanted to show support, get back on the horse again, and get going.  Some even
came in on their own time Monday to help with cleanup.)

     The worst part of the quake, really, was that my house was without
electricity until Midnight Thursday night.  So I'd write (up against a real
deadline because of the quake) at the office, charge up my notebook computer.
go home, fire up the notebook, and write scripts by flashlight.
