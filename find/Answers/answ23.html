<H2>   What are some of the non-aligned aliens?</H2>
<P>
     Well, let's see...there's the Drazi (slightly purplish heads, the ones
who beat the crap out of the guy in "War Prayer," and brought in the Drazi
Sunhawk in "Deathwalker"), the pak'ma'ra (the ones who shuffle through frame
in greenish robes, with tentacles where their mouths should be...and about
whom there is something very weird, rather icky, which you'll see in
"Legacies"), the Abbai, commonly known around the studio as "fishheads"...will
post a fuller description later.  Those are the ones you see mainly in DW.
