<H2>   Has anybody online speculated correctly what's gonna happen?</H2>
<P>
     Nothing on any of the systems, no.  But at one convention back east, I
was standing waiting to go on at a presentation, and a young woman came up to
me and laid out a conjecture that was 100% right in every single aspect. She'd
pegged it precisely.  I tried to conceal my growing horror.  Then she said.
"But *nobody* would be crazy enough to try something like that, so THAT can't
be it."  And with that, she toddled off...and I made no effort to correct her
assumption.
