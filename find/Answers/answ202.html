     That doesn't mean that bigotry is going to disappear, however; lilke
religion, there is some dark impulse there -- the tribal preservation
instinct, or somedamnthing -- that keeps turning up.  The target keeps
changing, but the impulse remains.  So likely it'll turn toward the new
"different" people...the outsiders...aliens.  I think you'll see a lot of
people taking an "Earth First" (no relation to the current group) mentality.
hate crimes against aliens, that sort of thing.
