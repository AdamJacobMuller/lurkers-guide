     What I want to do with this show is to connect our past, our present, and
our future, melding familiar images with new ones.  This isn't what you're
used to seeing.  But it's what I want to *do* with it.  Otherwise all you have
are unattainable futures about people who we barely recognize as being humans.
doing things we can't relate to.  I'm sorry, but that just doesn't interest
me.

     The main line I've been stressing with our writers and others who we're
working with is the goal of making our humans more human, and our aliens more
alien.  Much of our life is focused around things that don't generally show up
in SF television...we cut ourselves shaving, we have to find a bathroom, our
shoes don't fit...and these are the elements that help make a character more
real somehow.  So yes, we're very definitely going for that aspect.
