<H2>   How much is ad-libbed?</H2>
<P>
     The notion of how much actors improvise on TV is *grossly* exaggerated.
I have not worked on any show yet in which the actor is allowed to just change
lines or wordings on set without first getting permission from the story
editor or producer.
<P>
     The reason for this is very simple: episodes are not shot in order of
scenes, but in order of location (i.e., all the mess hall shots are done in
there, then you move the camera crew to another location, and you do all those
scenes, then you interweave them in editing).  It's VERY easy to lose track if
you're shooting that way, and you can change a line in scene 9, from "He said
it's the absolute truth" to "He said he wasn't lying," not realizing that
*another* character in another scene has already said, or will say, "Like Mike
said, it's the absolute truth," and now those two scenes don't match.  Meaning
you now have to go in and edit around it and loop the dialogue.
<P>
     Sometimes an actor may not fully realize that there's a clue, or a
particular line that must be repeated.  So the rule on EVERY show that I've
ever worked on -- particularly the more technical ones -- have the same rule:
absolutely NO changes allowed on set without consultation with the story
editor/producer(s).  That's the rule on B5. Murder She Wrote, the Twilight
Zone...on and on and on.
