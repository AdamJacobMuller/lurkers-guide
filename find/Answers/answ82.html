<H2>   How about the raider ships?  Why so vulnerable?</H2>

     RE: the Raider ships...they turned by a less effective system of
thrusters put in here and there, not nearly as powerful as the systems used by
the Starfuries.  The reason -- verifiable by the shape of the Raider ships --
is that Raider ships are handicapped by the fact that they're made to function
both in space *and* within an atmosphere (hence the aerodynamic wing shapes).
which gives it something of a problem when dealing with the Starfuries, which
are made ONLY for fighting in space, and are most ideally suited to it.  The
Raider ships make compromises for greater utility, which is generally okay
unless they run into superior forces of ships designed for spaceborne combat.
