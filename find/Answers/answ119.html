<H2>   How does the economic system work, on Earth and on the station?</H2>
<P>
     The Earth economy still runs on basic capitalism; the corporations
under-write surveying and exploitation of planets, in some cases then selling
what they find to the government in return for a piece of the profits, or via
direct exploitation itself.  (By law they're forbidden from exploiting or
strip-mining worlds with sentient life.)  There is also, as we discover in one
episode, a big market for archaeologists who dig into now-dead worlds for
whatever technology they can find, which might have been ancient there, but
are new to us.

     Money works as in any large city.  You come in with the money of your
place of origin (assuming you haven't made adjustments prior to arriving), and
exchange it for prevalent Earth value credits, as determined by the current
exchange rate.  You are issued a credit chit that has your name, ID, other
information, including genetic information to prevent forgery, and that has
your available credits as stored in the B5 computer.  As you pay, as with any
credit card, you whittle away at that amount until it's gone, at which point
you either cash in more of your money...or go broke.
<P><HR><P>
     The credit chits work differently depending on who you are.  If you work
for B5, your salary is tied into your credit chit, and you pay accordingly.
If you're a visitor from elsewhere, bringing in non-Earth currency, you
exchange that currency (as Aldous noted in "Grail"), much as you do now.
Difference is, you turn in the currency at the B5 exchange.  It is processed
on the current rate of exchange. and you are issued a credit chit programmed
with an amount equal to whatever you brought in.  You use it the same way as a
credit card. until it runs out, then it's rejected until you "recharge" it by
exchanging more currency.
<P>
     It's also tied into your identicard, which has every available fact about
you.

     Interestingly enough, I just saw an article in, I believe, WIRED. which
noted that Sweden had just launched on a program of using this exact same
device, same system, on a trial basis.
