     Yes, this is the actual text of a script.  And a script contains scene
descriptions, dialogue, directions.  (Contrary to popular opinion, the actors
don't just make up their lines when they hit the stage, based on loose ideas
by somebody.)  My scripts tend to be *very* detailed, with camera movement
suggestions, optical notes, indications of dissolves vs. cuts, on and on.

     A script page, single-spaced, works out to about the same wordage as a
double-spaced prose fiction page, about 225-250 words per.
