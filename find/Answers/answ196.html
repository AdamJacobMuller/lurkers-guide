     Sports/recreation are things we're still trying to work out; not the
conceptual part, but the part about "okay, how do we SHOOT this?"  I'm not big
on "virtual reality" parlors or combat...I think people will still be more
interested in playing with real people than pixels.  So we're trying to find
ways we can visualize, in a TV series, things like zero-G tag or football.
other sports that use our unique space environment.  One possibility is now
being worked on, and we'll see if we can work it out for this season.  In any
event, it's definitely something we're thinking about...I just don't want to
rush into doing it until I know we can do it properly.
