     PPG = Phased Plasma Gun, and yes, the settings work about the way you
describe.  At full settings, it burns right through the body (and you can see
this in some shots, albeit briefly and discreetly).  We also deal with the
reality of what such a weapon *does* to you...internal burns, clothes melting
into the skin, that sort of thing.  We don't get gross about it, but we try to
stay with the reality of what we're creating.

     Re: the PPG firing...we talked to some high-IQ types about how a
plasma-firing weapon might work.  There would be superheated bursts, some
marginal escape of the gases used, and it would burn through the air, creating
a small thunderclap-like sound.  So this is what we did.

     The PPGs are Phased Plasma Guns, using superheated helium.  It doesn't
ricochet like conventional slugs, dissipates quickly after a hit, can be
adjusted to produce surface damage, or cut straight through the body, or to
make a big impact without burning through.  At full strength, they burn
straight through any kind of body, causing massive internal burns and damage
to the internal organs.  The clothes melt right into the skin.  It's not a
pretty thing.  Generally they're operated at a lower or less lethal setting.

     The ripple is caused by heat from the discharge.

     There are definitely PPG assault rifles, which are visible in  "Grail."
They can fire faster than pistols, but I don't think they could handle the
power-buildup to fire 3-6 per second.  That's definitely slug-thrower turf.
