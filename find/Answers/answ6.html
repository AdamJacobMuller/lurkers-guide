     What happens at the end of the five year arc?  The "Babylon 5" series
ends...if I have anything to say about it (and I do).  If something esle
follows, we'll see what that is, but it won't be the same series, or the same
title, or really the same characters.
<P>
     Barring that very distant possibility, at the end of the five year arc, I
take a very, very, VERY long nap....

     Re: the end of the 5th year...I've noted before that there is a thread
raised during the B5 run that could be extended into its own series.  But it
wouldn't be B5.  The story of Babylon 5 ends at the end of the fifth year.
regardless.

     I'm being very careful not to let B5 turn into a *franchise*.  It's a
story, created in X-parts, for television.  This thing will turn into an
industry over my dead body.  The most that the framework will permit is a
2-hour TV movie that caps year 5.  That's it.
