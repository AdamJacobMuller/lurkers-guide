     We're going to re-create an entire new hairpiece that will lay flatter
and look better from the back, which I felt was one of its drawbacks.  Also.
we don't want to have Peter shave his head for the whole series, as he did for
the pilot, so we're coming up with a longer prosthetic that'll come all the
way over the top of the head to the eyebrows, where we'll blend it in
unnoticeably.  This will make Peter's life just that much easier.

     We're not changing Londo's hair to make it anything less than what it is.
It'll still be as outrageous as it was in the pilot.  What I was referring to
specifically was the way it bunched up at the back of the head, just above the
nape of the neck.  What they had done was take a conventional wig and shove
the hair up and lock it into place; in this case, we're stringing a new.
custom wig that will gently come up in the back, as if growing naturally in
that direction.  The top part will be the same, it's only a matter of cleaning
up the back, which simply didn't work aesthetically.

     I find it interesting that people can accept spots, scales, fur.
foreheads, reptiles and parasites...but not a different style of hair, used to
denote one's rank or position (as is done in some primitive societies right
here).  Look at the history of hair just around us in the last hundred or so
years...long hair, powdered wigs, crew-cuts, braids, dreadlocks, spikes.
mohawks....

     Among those I've talked to, it seems that folks from other places --
England, Europe, some from Japan -- have *zero* problem with the hair.  It
seems genuinely an American reaction.  I was talking to someone about this
earlier this evening, and the comment came back that Americans in particular
are absolutely *obsessed* with not being embarrassed, or being made fools of.
When they (we) see someone who doesn't match our view of what's the norm, we
imagine how we would feel in that position.  And to make ourselves more
secure, as in high school, we make fun of what would personally embarrass us.
When the underground/subculture of the 60s got ANY chance to express its
views, what did people focus on?  Their hair.   Sometimes other personal
traits, but usually the hair.  "Damn longhaired freaks."
<P>
     To see *hair*, of all things, being somehow less acceptable than funny
foreheads, scales, or other aspects of alien-ness flatly astonishes me.  (It
was also pointed out to me that in the first season of the original Trek.
there was a *lot* of mail to Paramount about losing the pointy ears on Spock.
that they just looked stupid.)
<P>
     It just seems sad to me, and somehow informative, that people are unable
to see past the hair to the person.  Are we really that conservative and
ethnocentric?  I particularly feel strongly about this for Peter, who is
absolutely *out there*, taking a great risk with this character, who is doing
an amazing performance...and all people can talk about is the hair, as though
that somehow diminishes the performance.
<P>
     Amazing, really....
