     For those who might be interested, we've come up with some name for the
various clans of the Minbari warrior caste.  The primary five are the Star
Riders (the oldest), the Moon Shields, the Wind Swords, the Night Walkers and
the Fire Wings.  (The first three refer to the early Minbari version of a
mounted force, for which you need riders with shields and swords, with #4
referring to foot soldiers, and the last to those whose clan first used flying
machines in battle.)

     (Oh, and Star Riders refers to those mounted soldiers who were trained to
use the stars for navigation.  Behind them came the foot soldiers, who were
expert at traveling by night.)
