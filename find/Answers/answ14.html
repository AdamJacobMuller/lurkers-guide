<H2>   Will we find out what happened to Babylon four, three, two, one?</H2>
<P>
     After the meeting, Ron Thornton and I were talking, and he said, "Okay.
what's the deal on Babylon 4?  I mean, are we ever going to see what happened
to it, or see it again?"
<P>
     I smiled.  "Do you REALLY want to know?"
<P>
     He considered it for a moment.  I think he gets nervous when I smile like
that.  "Okay...sure."
<P>
     So I told him.  And his eyes went wide as pancakes.  It was a wonderful.
Tex Avery effect.  "Get out of here," he said, at first sure I was kidding. I
explained that I was quite serious.
<P>
     Last I saw him, he was wandering off, muttering to himself, but growing
increasingly enchanted with the idea....

     The EA has owned all of the Babylons; 1-3 were sabotaged early in
construction, so it wasn't too much of a loss.  They dumped a BIG budget into
B4, and when that died, barely passed the budget for #5, skimping all the way.
cutting it down to bare bones operating expenses.  They will and would never
approve a #6.

     B4 never got as far as having a commander attached to it.  The last
stages of construction on Babylon 4 were supervised by one Major Krantz.
assigned specifically to that task.  He managed to get the station completed.
and on-line, and Earthforce was just beginning the process of selecting a
commanding officer to run the station when, 24 hours after the station became
operational, it vanished, taking roughly 1,200 of its skeleton crew with it
(including Major Krantz).

     B1-B4 were located in roughly the same sector, with B4 using some of the
materials from 1-3 leftover.  B5 was constructed about 3 hours (traveling time
in real-space) from the location of B4.
