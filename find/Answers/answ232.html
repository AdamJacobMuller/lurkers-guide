<H2>   Is Straczynski a household name?</H2>
<P>
     I hate to burst any bubbles, but I can go just about anywhere in the U.S.
and find that nobody knows the name Straczynski, and the only time I've caused
a mob scene at a K-mart was in a tussle over the last Captain Power
figures...or was that when I wandered into the lingerie section and...well.
never mind.
