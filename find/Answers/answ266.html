     Today was "Men In Skirts Day" for many in the Babylon 5 crew.
<P>
     There are some things man was not meant to know....

     Re: the crew...today was Pajama Day.  Don't ask.

     Our head of post production, associate producer George Johnsen, pulled a
number on me today that just struck me as hilarious, and I pass it on to you.
(We do a lot of silly stuff behind the scenes.)

     Take your hands.  Fold in the thumb until it's pointing in toward the
palm of your hand, but not entirely.  Fan out your other four fingers on each
hand as far as you can.  Now put the two hands together so that the index
fingers touch, and the pinkies are on either side of one another (i.e., you've
formed a crown or fan).  Raise your hands so that your wrists are settling on
either side of the top of your head.
<P>
     Now look at the person sitting next to you and say, "Live, Londo, and
Prosper."  This is the unofficial B5 crew greeting.  Apparently some have been
doing it when they arrive for work in the morning.

     We're a sick bunch, but we're fun.

     Funny...I sometimes make up little clips from shows and put them to music
for myself or for convention appearances...and I was giving some serious
thought to assembling a montage and using "I Am the Walrus" by the Beatles as
the music...and then realized that it would probably give away too much if I
composed the pictures correctly with the lyrics.
<P>
     I am the walrus...coo-coo ka choo....

     During the con appearance, Jerry told a story that *I* hadn't heard
before.  There's a scene in the script "Midnight on the Firing Line" in which
Talia (Andrea) goes into a transport tube, finds Garibaldi, and asks some
questions about Ivanova.  They rehearsed it several times, this being Andrea's
first time on the set, and filmed one take.  She comes down the hall, comes to
thepen...and Garibaldi's pants are down around his ankles. Needless to say.
that shot did NOT end up in dailies....
