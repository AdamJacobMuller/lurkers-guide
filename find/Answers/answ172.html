     Preface: as has been stated before, since no studio facility was big
enough for our purposes (we now have 20 standing sets and 57 swing sets, some
120' wide or more), we took over an industrial facility roughly the size of
Latvia and built three soundproofed soundstages, costume facilities.
construction areas, dubbing room, prosthetics wings, you name it.  It's sort
of a Lucas Ranch operation, everything under one roof.
<P>
     A number of shows have taken over and converted such facilities to shoot
series, but I'm proud to note that this is the *first* such conversion to be
finally, officially and formally redefined by the city as a working studio.
It's the *first* new studio in town in something like 10 years.  There's
nothing else like it unless you want to actually go on the lot of a major
studio.  (And it has the advantage of being off the lot, away from people who
might wander into your stage and, oh, start giving you notes.  If you're a bit
away, they have to drive over, and the hassle ain't worth it.)

     Ah!  Now I begin to understand.  Alas, my offices aren't on the Warners
lot either; we're well and truly off-campus.  Next time look up north a piece
past the Universal Black Tower, and wave, I'll see you.

     The end of the central corridor was a painting; correct.  And I never
liked it.  So over the break, we *built* another 15 or so feet to the end of
the corridor, going up, so now it's quite real, and we can put stuff in there.
Much improved.
