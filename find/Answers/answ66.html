     As I recall, the photo and article is about Sinclair's ancestor, who
fought in the Battle of Britain.  And the framed piece is indeed a Sinclair
Aircraft logo.

     There is some history there with Sinclair's father, but I'm not getting
into it this season because there are some other family issues involving our
characters that I want to delve into initially, and I don't want to step in
the same stream too many times, as it were.

     You won't see Sinclair's brother this season...and that's all I can say
for now.
