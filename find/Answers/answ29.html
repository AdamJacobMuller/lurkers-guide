<H2>   How does Kosh communicate?</H2>
<P>
     Now that we've finished mixing some shows, we've now seen how Kosh
speaks, followed through to the end.  It's a very unusual system that he's got
there, and it's *real* creepy to watch/listen to it.  The kind of thing that
makes your skin crawl after a while.

     I love it.

     Correct, Christopher Franke designed Kosh's voice.
