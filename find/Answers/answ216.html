     BTW, Compton's has signed to do a CD Rom of the Babylon 5 Universe, which
is going to be VERY comprehensive...all the alien races, including the League
of Non-aligned Worlds, background on the war, dictionaries, other reference
stuff, you name it; it'll also be able to take advantage of the latest
voice-recognition software, so you can run it exactly as the B5 computer is
run.  ("Computer, language search, "Satai.")  There will even be some original
CG and live-stuff shot for it.  It should be a killer CD Rom. (Now if only I
could get my system up and running....)

     Re: the CD-Rom...we're planning some very cool stuff.  I've indicated on
all pending licensing deals that I don't want them to be just one more media
tie-in; they should have some independent value.  So in this case, I really
want to use it to de-mysticize what television is, and how it's produced.
Something for educational purposes.  So we'll track how the process is done.
by taking a micro-example: from concept, to a scene in a script, to costume
designs, production/set design, storyboards prosthetics, filming, editing.
scoring and mixing.  As a culmination of this, there will be 5-7 brief dailies
shosts, all from the same scene.   The job then is for the user to edit these
dailies (establishing shot, medium close-up, close-ups, inserts and the like)
into a *scene*.  You can literally see the dozens of ways you can create a
scene from the same footage.  You can then play it back, possibly with some
music, and see how it works...then play back the real scene as we did it, and
compare and contrast.

     Last date I heard was January 1995, but the main problem is that there's
just an awful lot of information to codify and assemble, and Compton's has
been going through some personnel changes of late.
