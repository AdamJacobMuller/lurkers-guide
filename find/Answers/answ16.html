     Overall title for season two: "The Coming of Shadows."

     Next season's last episode will not be a cliffhanger per se, but will,
like "Chrysalis," just escalate the hell out of the show.

     Haven't yet seen or heard what the airdate schedule will be like for next
year, but like you I hope it'll be with more new episodes straight through.
and fewer interruptions by reruns.
<P><HR><P>
     There will be 22 episodes in season two.

     Yes, in season two, we'll be seeing a lot of the jumpgates from up close,
and straight through.
