[This refers to a potential sequel to Harlan Ellison's _Outer Limits_ episode.
"Demon With a Glass Hand"]

     I thought long and hard about the question of mixing universes, and
allowed it only in this one case, because the events that propelled Trent (the
character from Demon) into the past (our present) don't take place for another
thousand years or so.  Thus it doesn't do my arc any harm at all. One could
say that the events in "Demon" will happen at some point in the future of the
B5 universe...unless some events change them.  On this one occasion.
therefore, I decided to allow it.  But that's the ONLY one.

     We're still working out the dynamics of how these two universes would
cross seamlessly, without doing damage to either.  We've got some solid leads.
but this is 'way too early to get into them.  More down the road, one
hopes....

     Yes, the two Harlan scripts are temporarily on hold, due to some health
problems earlier this season (two heart procedures), the quake and his
injuries there, and other stuff.  He has, however, served very well as our
consultant, and it has been more than worthwhile.  His health permitting, we
hope to continue the relationship in future.

     Harlan is currently writing the "Demon" sequel for us.  He is on as
Conceptual Consultant next year, and is working closely with us.  But there
are always people out to tear Harlan down, so I'd pretty much ignore these
weasels.
