     Mike: see my comment in 19.

     There's some more fun between Garibaldi and Talia down the road, and one
elevator scene in particular that I think you'll like.

     We've killed off all of Ivanova's close family, yes.  Maybe some cousins
are left, but that's about it.

     A little aside for you...at one point this season, Delenn goes to the
Grey Council.  There's a ritual she has to observe when she joins the ranks of
the Nine.  Part of it is this statement she makes upon entering the circle: "I
am Grey.  I stand between the candle, and the star.  We are Grey.  We stand
between the darkness, and the light."
