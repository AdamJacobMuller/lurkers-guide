     It's not so much story ideas (though I suppose there is some validity to
that point) as...I dunno...just seeing one speculation after another after
another, going through every conceivable possibility and
combination...granted, some is inevitable, it was just the systematic and
extremely...*energetic* hammering that made me wonder if this might not end up
hindering people's enjoyment of the show and its revelations rather than
assisting it.

                                                                  jms
