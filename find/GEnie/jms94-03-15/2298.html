     Some random thoughts:

     I would *never* pull a "he wakes up and it was all a dream" on the
series.  I hate that kind of story.

     There's more in that newspaper than meets the eye....

     Note in the episode that when Sinclair's wheeled down the hall, still in
his uniform, he's not bloodied up.  But is later.

     This is, as stated, one of my favorites from this season.  (And the
person behind the lighting is the same one behind all the episodes, John
Flinn, our cinematographer, working with Janet Greek, our director.)  I would
put at this approximate level (some better, some as good) the following
episodes (for varying reasons): "By Any Means Necessary,"  "Babylon Squared,"
"Signs and Portents," "A Voice in the Wilderness," and of course "Chrysalis."

                                                               jms
