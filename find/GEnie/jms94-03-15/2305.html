     It wasn't a reference to the Heinlein book, only to the historical use of
that design.  Re: the breather masks...in cases of riot, sometimes they pump
in gas.  Also, if they have to chase any of the aliens into the alien sector's
alternate-atmosphere sections, they have to be wearing breathers.  (Believe
