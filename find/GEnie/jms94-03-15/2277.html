     Longshot: it was a tip of the cap to the Prisoner, yes.

     Episodes are all in various stages of post-production; they come out
helter-skelter, higgeldy-piggeldy, you name it.  We're pretty much caught up
on all the episodes filmed; we have to finalize editing on the two-parter,
then edit the last episode, and that's done.  A bunch of the others are still
being scored, mixed, composited, you name it.  So that's really a very hard
question to answer.  Just today finished editing on "Babylon Squared," which
looks really cool, will mix "Signs and Portents" in two days, and finalized
the mix on "The Quality of Mercy" today.

                                                                jms
