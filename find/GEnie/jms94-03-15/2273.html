     Actually, we came very close to doing a black-and-white segment this
season, and might do so next.

     Well, last night was the B5 wrap party, at Pickwick Bowl here in the
valley, opposite the equestrian center.  I think I bowled about nine games in
a row, and currently ache in muscles I didn't know I had.  About 325 cast,
crew, writers and producers.  Harlan showed up, and after a slow start bowled
180 and whomped hell out of us.  I averaged about 160 in my later games.  Or
less.  David Gerrold showed up, Larry, Andreas, Michael, Peter, Mira, Caitlin,
Bill...and the B5 Blasters, the art department bowling team with their own
bowling shirts.  When I left, about 12:30 am, things were still going pretty
strong.

                                                                 jms
