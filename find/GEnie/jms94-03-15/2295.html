     What?  Who, me?  Near as I remember, the Question was, "What happened at
the Battle of the Line?"  Answer: Sinclair was taken aboard the Minbari
cruiser, tortured, interrogated, mind-wiped and shoved back into his ship.

     The Question *now* is, "WHY was Sinclair taken aboard the Minbari
cruiser, tortured, interrogated, mind-wiped and shoved back into his ship?"

     That question was not asked heretofore...so how could it be still
unanswered?
