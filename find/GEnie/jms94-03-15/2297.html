     Goodman: the CGI won't look as good in slow motion because we step-
printed them deliberately, in order to give them a more dream-like appearance.
For us, this wasn't about the ships, it was about one of the men in the ship,
which is why we kept him in sharp focus, and went to step-printing whenever we
went outside (and since we're seeing this from his memory, clearly he wouldn't
actually have *seen* most of this, it's his *sense* of what happened).  You'll
get plenty of clear CGI in "Signs and Portents," airing in May.
