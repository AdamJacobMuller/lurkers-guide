     I dunno...that's an *awful* big cruiser, given the specs.  The thing to
bear in mind is that in space, you don't really have a reference point.  So if
something is in the foreground, it can look large against the background (the
cruiser), making the cruiser look small.  (It's the same effect as holding a
tennis ball in front of your eye, and using it to block out the sun; the
tennis ball isn't bigger than the sun, it's a matter of where you're
standing.)  Sinclair's ship is a LONG ways from the cruiser when last you see
it.  That maw is a massive launch area.   It's really *huge*.  Perhaps you'll
get a better understanding of how big it is in a certain later episode, where
you'll be able to see a single ship entering the maw *at* the maw itself,
which should put it all into the correct perspective.
