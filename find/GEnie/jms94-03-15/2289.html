     Correct; the fighters enter via the main docking bay, are lowered into
maintainance bays, repaired/recharged, then set back in place.  You will see a
goodly portion of this in "Survivors."

     And the Narns didn't really have the resources for an invasion of Earth
at that time.

     Nor would much be gained, either.

                                                                jms
