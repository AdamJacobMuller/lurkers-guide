      Well, now I've heard it all...was speaking to Walter Koenig tonight,
 and he mentioned being at a convention this past weekend, and hearing a
 lot of positive B5 comments.  Along the way, he overheard a discussion
 between a bunch of folk, many of whom were defending TNG and DS9's rather
 minimal SFX and smaller cast and other stuff by saying that it wasn't
 a fair comparison, "since B5 has a lot more money to spend than TNG or
 DS9."

      I could've plotzed.....
