     It's 23E, yes.  And the ships have been somewhat upgraded, but the basic
configuration remains.  Also, after the war, a LOT of the EA's fleet was wiped
out, so it's been a very slow process of putting out new ships.  Even B5 isn't
completely armed as of this time; they'll be getting in their final squadron,
Zeta Squadron, in "Survivors."  (Right now all they have are Delta and Alpha
flights.)  The budget is very tight.
