                        *** YES! ***

     The composer we've wanted, who we've been courting, has seen the rough
assembly and likes what he sees!  He wants to do it!  Insofar as I know,
there's only one deal point remaining to be resolved.  Once that's done, and
Warners has approved, I can probably make some sort of announcement, all
things being equalized.
