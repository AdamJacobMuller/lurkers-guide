     Er, actually, any reposts of my messages should only be noted as
copyright by me.  Just a formality.

     Just returned from the San Francisco con, and about ready to drop, which
sums up pretty well my status for the last few days.

     We wrapped Friday night at 2 a.m., and there wasn't a party (we were all
too bushed) but a general well-wishing sort of thing.  Didn't get home until
nearly 3:30 a.m., or asleep until 5 a.m....and then could only grab two or so
hours sleep before having to get up and nab the plane in time for the B5
presentation in San Francisco.

     Emotions were really riding high Friday night as we got off the last shot
of the pilot.  No one really wanted to leave, despite the late hour.  They're
a good bunch.

     Anyway, I'm going to go and put my feet up, try to eat around my broken
tooth, take some aspirin, and try to get better.  It's as if my body were able
to stand the strain just long enough to finish the job of the last four weeks,
and then imploded....

     Later.
