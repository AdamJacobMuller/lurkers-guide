      I'd say there were extenuating circumstances here that made it more than
just a simple murder (and not all murders get wiped, esp. in cases like second-
degree or manslaughter).  He'd stalked Edward for years; arranged to break the
mindwipe; and engaged in slow, deliberate, methodical torture unto death.  The
degree of premeditation is staggering.

                                                                  jms
