     We hope to *FINALLY* be able to announce the formation of the  official
Babylon 5 Fan Club within the next 7 days or so.  From time to time, news
about this will get dropped here, and we can use this for notices relating to
the club, and information about joining and such. 

     We've been negotiating with WB for *over a year* to let us do this, and
it's taken a long time mainly because they didn't think anyone would be
interested in a fan club for something not ST.  (Sound familiar?)  But
finally, after much persistence, we're finally at a point where I can say I
think it's going to happen at last.  Stay tuned....

                                                                   jms
