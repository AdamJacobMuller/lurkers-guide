     YAAAAAAGGGGHHHHH.....

     Well, I *finally* finished writing the two-parter, "War Without End,"
which is probably the toughest thing I've written for the series to date.  
Given everything that has to fit in here, and the fact that it's the other
half of the B4 storyline (this ain't a spoiler, that'll be common knowledge in
ads and the like), it became a pretty difficult job, moreso than when I'd
originally thunk it up.  It's kinda like cramming 20 pounds of potatoes in a
10 pound bag...but I *think* I got it all in, even though the initial drafts
came out at about 7 pages too long.  As I commented to one person, "I'm
definitely dancing on the edge of my ability here."  But I'm pretty sure I
pulled it all off...and I think folks are going to be quite pleased.

     But *man* that was tough....

     Now, having written 16 and 17, only 5 scripts remain to be written for
this season.  And there's still an awful lot to fit in before the big season
ender, which I suspect will raise quite a few eyebrows.  

                                                                jms
