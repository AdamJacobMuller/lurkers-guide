     On those other services, the sysops arranged for conferences with the
cast members involved.  That could be done just as easily for GEnie as others.
Just hasn't been done.  To my knowledge, no one's been invited.  (I think it's
been mentioned in my direction once or twice, but not for a while, and I don't
think anything was really ever pinned down, but my memory isn't all it
was...if it ever was....)
