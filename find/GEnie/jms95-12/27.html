      Actually, I always kinda thought that the people granted the people
their rights, then created the government to arbitrate in the dispute over the
use of those rights.  

      For a glimpse on how ST stories get written, btw, pick up the latest
copy of WIRED.  I know this kind of thing works for some folks, but it just
makes my hair stand on end.

                                                                     jms
