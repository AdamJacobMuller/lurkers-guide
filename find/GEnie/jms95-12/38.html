     Thanks.  Though I knew about the gaff a LONG time before it was to air
here in the US, I let the east/west thing go through as shot for the very
first broadcast because I was afraid that the loop might hurt the scene, and
it was *so* perfectly done.  That over, I decided it was worth taking a shot
at it.  If your friend didn't notice, then we did it right.   So now those who
taped the first broadcast have something that'll never be seen again (if I
have anything to say about it).
