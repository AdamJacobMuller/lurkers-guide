     You want to know how much Joe has been writing lately?  You want to know
the goofy side of it?  

     I write with keyboard in lap, leaning back, legs in a broken-4 position
(left ankle crossing right knee) to support it.  Well, I've been writing so
much, so *long*, lately that I recently discovered that there is now an actual
indentation in my left leg, just above the ankle, where it's been abraded by
cloth, and the circulatoin's been hindered, and there's been constant pressure
placed on it.  I've actually lost some sensitivity in that 5-inch section. 
THAT'S how much I've been writing this year.

     I need a vacation.
