     Actually, in each TZ season, there were many other writers, though
Serling wrote the majority of each season (also, the lion's share of TZ
episodes were *half-hours*, not hours).  But fundamentally, what matters most
is not the volume or quantity of scripts, but the quality of what goes IN
them.  I'd rather write 1 good script than 4 mediocre scripts.

                                                                      jms
