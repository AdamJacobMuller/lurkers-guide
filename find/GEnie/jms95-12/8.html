     Actually, I tend to spend the same amount of time here as anywhere else;
more, in fact.  I inevitably log onto GEnie minimum of twice a day; I
sometimes go a couple/three days without logging onto AOL, for instance,
though then I post several messages at a time, so you get a flurry.  As for
CIS, bear in mind that I've been on that service LONG before GEnie even came
along, since 1984/85, and that has the benefit of using an offline
reader/posting program, Tapcis...I've tried Aladdin, and can't get it to do
the stuff I want...this isn't an invitation to teach me, I don't have time for
the learning curve right now...so everything you see from me here on GEnie is
written live, on-line.  That sometimes mitigates a *bit* against the number of
posts, but no more so than at any time before.

     The video thing didn't come out as an announcement, but rather as an
aside to an ongoing discussion that touched into this area.  It wasn't a case
of, "Aha!  I have this to announce, so I'll do it HERE rather than on GEnie." 
That's just where it occured to me in the natural progression of messages. 
Just like stuff gets mentioned here that sometimes doesn't get mentioned
elsewhere.  Which is why there are a number of folks out there collecting my
posts on various services and reposting them onto other services, because I
don't generally talk about the same stuff in all these different places.  If I
just did redundent postings, there'd be no need for that.

     Finally, if there *is* any numerical difference in postings -- and I
dispute that premise -- it may come from the fact that in general, on the
newer places, I tend to get a lot more specific questions than here; and most
of the ones here, or in general, tend to be "is this going to happen," or
asking for details on upcoming stuff, which I really can't answer often or in
great specificity.

     I still consider GEnie and CIS my two primary services, having been here
the longest...but let's not get proprietary here....
