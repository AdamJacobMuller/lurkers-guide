     Jeff: yep, that was you I was thinking of...thanks for leaping up and
helping indicate I'm not senile (well, yet, anyway).

     Re: Mechwarrior 2...I don't have any first-hand experience with the game,
so don't take my purchase as recommendation; I'd just read some of the
reviews, and figured I'd check it out.

     Re: Sinclair as the One...funny how all this time very few folks have
really commented much on how it was that Zathras could look right into
Sinclair's face and say, "NOT the One."
