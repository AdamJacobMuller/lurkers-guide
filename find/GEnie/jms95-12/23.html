     Kwicker &amp; Jose: exactly my point.  Kelley *co-wrote* all of a season, or
all but one of a season, sometimes supplying the story, or rewriting another's
script...but no one's done it *singlehandedly* before.  

     So Nation did 13 episodes that season?  Well, then looks like that
record's been broken already; 17 this season already.  Plus 4 from the end of
last season, so when this is all over (year 3) that'll be 26 in a row,
unbroken.  (Or is it 27?  What aired before the final four?)

     This is probably the ultimate in trivial details, but it's the sort of
thing that helps me keep going.

                                                               jms
