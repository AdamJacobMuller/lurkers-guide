     Actually, bear in mind that the American system operates through a series
of checks and balances; there's freedom of speech, but there are penalties if
you use that freedom to write defamatory newspapers, for instance.  In
cyberspace, the checks and balances are more than a little overdrawn....

     Tom: to your question...I do know that Terry Nation wrote a full season
of Blake's 7, though I don't know how many episodes that was.  Some folks have
checked around, and as near as can be determined, in American TV, no one
person has ever singlehandedly written an entire season of a one-hour dramatic
series in the entire 50 years or so of TV history.

                                                                   jms
