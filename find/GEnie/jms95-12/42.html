      One other aspect I forgot to mention is that if we do the tapes, there
are residuals and royalties to pay to actors, writers, directors as well as to
WB and elsewhere.  The more you put on a tape, the more residuals you end up
paying per tape...and the more the prices is going go up.  It's not the same
as copying a bunch of tapes for a friend; we have to pay everyone who
participated in the episode.
