     BTW, here's humor...though at the same time understandable given the
penchant for some folks to abuse the nets by pretending to be other people...I
got a call today from Claudia, who was trying to take part in a B5 IRC and
kept getting booted out by folks yelling at her for the crime of pretending to
be Claudia Christian.  Nobody believed it was her.   Perhaps in future we need
to find some way to verify when this happens.

     (BTW, speaking of net abuse, I'm led to understand, from the sysadmin on
the server in question, that Theron Fuller is no longer being allowed access
to Usenet from his account.)

                                                                    jms
