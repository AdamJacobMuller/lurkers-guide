      Bear in mind that the Agamemnon now has a captain of its own, and that
captain isn't going to just turn over command of his destroyer every time
Sheridan wants to take it out on a joy ride.  Also, the really important
missions Sheridan might use it for are probably things that the EA military
division might not be comfortable with, and would never let  him just take out
a destroyer just like that.
