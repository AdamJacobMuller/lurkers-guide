     The Centauri did not steal the bag; he had left long before Edward lost
it (we see him drop and leave it behind in the hallway).  AS Garibaldi said,
someone found it and tried to sell it.  

                                                                  jms

 
      Have listened to and enjoyed some of Enigma's work, yes.  Nice stuff.

      Can't predict fourth season script stuff at this early stage; one crisis
at a time.
