      Jose: "glad to have you back on rastb5 again"...huh?  I'm not on rastb5,
in limited fashion or otherwise.  Are you perhaps referring to the info group?

     Re: inspiration...in general this has meant people coming to me and
saying that because of the show, they've chosen to get involved in charities,
or social causes, or to register voters, or work in shelters; in Dallas at a
small convention I was at, a young man stood up in the seminar and said that
he was changing his major to social work because of the show...in email I
received a note from a fellow who, inspired by the notion that you can choose
a better life, relocated with his wife halfway across the country, against the
"advice" of everyone else, and created a new and better life doing *exactly*
what he wants to do with his life.

                                                                   jms
