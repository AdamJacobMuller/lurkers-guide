      Yes, "CoS" is a deliberate mirror-image of "Midnight," partly to
illustrate the notion that "the wheel turns," as G'Kar says...yes, it  does,
and if you forget that it eventually turns on *you*, you'll be ground beneath
it.

      I enjoyed Wing Commander 3, and will almost certainly buy WC3, but won't
play it until I've finished writing for the season, for obvious reasons....

                                                                   jms

(oops, meant to say WC4 above)
