     What else they would call it...hmm..........home?

     I have some names for y'all, for those keeping track.  We've finished
assembling our crack first team on the production side, and I can pass along
most of the names now.  We're astonished at the sheer level of quality we've
gotten on this stuff.  And tickled to have them.

     Director: Richard Compton.  One of the prime directors for The Equalizer
and Hill Street Blues and Miami Vice.

     Director of Cinematography: Billy Dickson.  Billy has an amazing eye for
color and shadow and composition that many of you may have seen on the
Desperado programs.  First-class.

     EFX Director: Ron Thornton.  Main EFX fellow behind The Addams Family,
Highlander II, Plymouth, Dr. Who The Movie and others.

     Production Designer: John Iacovelli.  Award winning production designer
direct from Honey, I Shrunk The Kids and other projects.

     Production Manager/Line Producer: Bob Brown.  Previously producer or
production manager on War of the Roses, Indiana Jones &amp; the Temple of Doom,
Return of the Jedi, Iceman and the three Childs Play movies.

     Casting Director: Mary Jo Slater.  Mary Jo has cast untold numbers of
movies and TV programs, from the revived Dark Shadows to the recent Intruders
mini-series to Star Trek VI.

     Plus others we've nabbed from James Cameron's company, Steven Spielberg's
company, George Lucas' company, Jim Henson's company, and others.  Names as I
can release them.

     This is a team that most any movie or TV series would *kill* for, and
we're very happy to have them all aboard.

     Today I saw the new suite of offices we've acquired.  People begin moving
in this week.  The numbers of people involved are expanding with astonishing
speed.  I strolled about in my new office, and that's when things begin to
become very real.  Have to acquire new furniture to fill it.  That'll make
three offices: my home office, my office at Universal, and my office at the
Babylon 5 location, plus a smaller office at the set which I'll be sharing
with my other executive producer, Doug Netter.

     It is now exactly 2 months to the day when we will begin rolling film.
From this point on, the clock is ticking, and there's a LOT to be done.  But
we're in very good shape, and I'm looking forward to it immensely.

                                                               jms
