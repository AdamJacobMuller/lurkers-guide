     All suggestions are equally considered...even the loony ones.

     Yes, when I'm finished with the B5 movie, I'll continue with M,SW (as I
am now, in fact), until the season concludes in February...which is about when
we'll dig in seriously on the B5 series.  What that means is that I'm really
doing double duty...I steal a few early-morning hours for B5, then go to M,SW,
put in a full day, leave around 5ish, then go to B5 and don't return home
again until sometimes 10 or 10:30 p.m.  (And of course there are days when I
have to be at B5 all day, for casting and other reasons.)  So I'm sometimes on
the go as much as 18-20 hours a day, depending on what's up.  Fortunately, the
producers at M,SW are fully aware of the situation, and support it, and as
long as I continue to handle my workload, have no problem with it.

     There is a tendency to forget where one lives sometimes, though....
