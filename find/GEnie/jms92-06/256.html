     Thanks, Joe.  Glad you're enjoying it.

     Joe...hmm...that reminds me....

     I've never been real big on formality.  And I know that typing
Straczynski can be a fearsome thing indeed.  Fingers were never meant to move
in that particular configuration, I think, and more than one person has had to
dial 911 with his nose when his fingers tangled on the keyboard.

     Point being..."Joe" is just fine.  If there's another Joe in a thread (as
above), "Mr. S." is is also fine if you need to make the distinction.  (One or
two have called me Big S.  Some comment that I'm the biggest S in town...and I
wish they wouldn't smile quite so broadly when they say it, or hold it quite
so long.)

     In any event, we're all in this together, so I think we can let formality
slide.

                                                         jms
