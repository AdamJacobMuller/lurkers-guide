     At this point, it looks like I'll be arriving on Thursday, and returning
on Sunday.  I *imagine* that the B5 presentation will be on Saturday, at least
that's what I'm going to push for.  Once I know for sure, I'll post the info
here.  I just learned this evening that the B5 presentation at WesterColt is
going to be on a Saturday, though I don't yet have a firm time.
