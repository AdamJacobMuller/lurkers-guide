     David Coulier, right-right-right, that's the guy.

     Took a look at the videotape, and remembered one other thing.  It took
nearly 20 minutes to get things calmed down after Welker let fly.  We had to
take a break so everyone could get their heads screwed back on again.
Everyone went back into the recording studio.  Sat.  A moment of silence as
they get ready....

     And there comes Frank Welker's voice, "Y'know...you ever wonder what
Charlton Heston's fart would sound like...?"

     The director lunged for the studio mike, "DON'T....YOU...***DARE***"

     He just smiled.

                                                                 jms
