     The boxed episode was wrong; several of my episodes (not the best ones,
but okay) appear in the other volumes of CP episodes; only about one-third
made it onto cassette.

     As for how Carolyn got a tan...she's a trader, remember, and she's
frequently planetside during her travels.  So NYAH!
