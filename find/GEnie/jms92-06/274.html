     We'll probably end up getting an intern via one of the local
universities.

     (Wonder if it'd be better to go for a creative writing student than a
film student...the latter can be such a pain....)

     When did I get over being nervous and anxious at someone reading my
words?

     Well, I'll tell you the truth: as soon as I hit that point, I'll let you
know.

                                                               jms
