     Some good names here; some I rather like.

     The circulation of the newsletter is going to be much broader than just
to Genie-ites; if that were the extent of it, then we wouldn't  NEED a
newsletter.  It's to plug in the...er..un-plugged-in.

     Saw some more actors today, some more cool EFX, and for the first time,
sketches of the prosthetics we'll be using for some of the actors.   WAY neat.
G'Kar is especially interesting.

     Long day (those who listen to HOUR 25 know why), so this'll be brief.
Good things coming.

                                                                   jms
