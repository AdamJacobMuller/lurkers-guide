     Ah, THAT explains why the picture wasn't in the issue I picked up (June).
Will look for the new one next week.

     In addition to our main casting director, we've now nailed down our
supplementary casting directors in New York and elsewhere.  Scouting starts
next week.  Don't expect any announcements on cast soon; for one thing, it
should go through Warners first, and for another, we're going to be VERY
picky.  We don't have to rush, and we're not going to.  Sets you can change,
lighting you can modify, but your cast is your cast.

     BTW, one of your number will be seeing the B5 script *and* the B5 demo
tomorrow afternoon.  If he sees this and would like to comment at all
(necessarily vaguely on the script, please), he's welcome to do so.

                                                                jms
