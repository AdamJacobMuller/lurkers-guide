     By all means, go ahead with the badge et al.  Sounds cool.

     Who are some of the actors we're getting in terms of shows?

     (Again, these are just *auditions,* not confirmed people; in fact, some
we know we won't use at this point, but it's interesting to see who we're
getting.)

     Got a call on the last bunch of people to come through, all of them very
good.  Person read down the list of names, and when I heard one of them I
stopped dead.  "WHO?!" I asked.  She read the name again, and _ assuming, I
suppose, that I didn't recognize it _ noted, "You know, from THE
AVENGERS...?"

     Oh.

                                                                   jms
