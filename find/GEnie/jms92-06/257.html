     Actually, that's something we've discussed...what if someone only sees in
the ultraviolet spectrum?  Or infrared?  For those individuals, the color
coding is different...though you won't be able to see it on your television
screens, because YOU can't see in the ultraviolet range, but it'll be there.

     Would this face lie?
