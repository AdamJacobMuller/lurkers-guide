     (pant-pant-pant) Barely a few minutes here to log on and update.

     Meetings galore.  Today we locked down the actual, physical look of our
main alien characters, and man, they're great.  Just great.  We've got Steve
Burg, one of the main conceptual designers behind Terminator 2, and John
Criswell, one of the main guys from the Henson Creature Shop, linked to handle
prosthetics and related areas.  They've both always wanted to cut loose with
what they can do, and we're hoping to give them that opportunity.

     So now the look of Londo, G'Kar, Delenn and Kosh is (are?) set.  I think
you'll approve (sly smile).

     Will lock down some of the cast in the next few days; the rest of the
cast in the next 7-10 days.  Set design has been approved by the studio.
We're now in the process of making deals for actors, construction firms, efx
shops and the like.  We're *really* starting to move now.

     That's the funny thing about a production like this...it takes a long
time to get moving; it's like slowly pushing a huge boulder inch by inch until
gradually it begins to pick up momentum...goes faster...and then it's all you
can do to keep it from speeding out of control, which is something you always
have to guard against when you've got *so* many people running in different
directions, doing different things.

     Onward.
