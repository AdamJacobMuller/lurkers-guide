     Paula...being only nominally computer literate, that's a question far
beyond my understanding.  When Ron Thornton does his RTC with me prior to B5
airdate, you might want to address that question to him.

     I seem to recall that the Conrad incident was *after* I'd finished
working on the show, which made it just that much funnier.  I mean, it just
went on and on and on...windows were blown out...birds fell from the
sky...women went into labor...animals keeled over and died...passing airplanes
momentarily lost power...dogs for five miles in any direction suddenly looked
around and wondered "What the hell was THAT?"....

     I can't believe it...I've degenerated my *own* topic into fart jokes.

                                                                 jms
