     I've already talked to Ron about doing an RTC sometime closer to airdate,
and he's agreed.  Frankly, I'd rather he continued pounding away at the EFX
than here, for the time being.  (I can afford to take the time, the script's
already written...all I have to do now is, oh, produce the damned
thing...besides, I'm just plain nuts.)

                                                                 jms
