     I'll announce as soon as I can.  If you haven't yet recieved your shirt,
after ordering one, re-contact the same address and check with Susan.  Gently.
We don't want to startle her.

     Still lining up cons on the East Coast.  I've kinda unofficially agreed
to be at WishCon in NY, so that's a start.  Will expand from there.  The hard
part is stealing time away from work here on two shows at the same time.
Thank Mojo for notebook computers....
