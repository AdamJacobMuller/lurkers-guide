     BTW, for those who might be interested in finding out what your loyal
correspondent has gotten himself into THIS time, if you're on the East Coast,
check today's (Wednesday's) BOSTON GLOBE, or yesterday's NEW YORK TIMES page
12 (art theft info, which ties into the Globe), or the trades or USA Today
over the next day or two.
