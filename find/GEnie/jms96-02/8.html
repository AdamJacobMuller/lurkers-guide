      Well, Mike, then you're bound to be disppointed because one of those
things is going to be dealt with for sure.  Some things can get by without
resolution; some things can't.  Otherwise people get frustrated because
nothing means anything, it's just random threads, and you get Twin Peaks.  
(And then they turn around and, because you didn't resolve something, say it's
a "plot hole" and gig you for bad writing).  

                                                                  jms
