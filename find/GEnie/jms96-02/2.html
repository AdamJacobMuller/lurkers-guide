     Brett: it's nothing to do with the editor.  We deliver nice, clean fades
to black.  When the show is delivered, we often get clipped by the local
stations (sometimes, we suspect, when the national spots are slugged in),
because if you clip a couple seconds here and there, you get enough time to
slip in another blipvert/promo.

                                                                   jms
