      Why didn't we do the music change in the end credits at the very start
of the season, you ask?  Why, what a silly question, it was all planned, all
intentional, it means...er...it means....

      It means we *forgot*.  More correctly, *I* forgot.  We were all so busy
getting the new main titles done, we just kinda forgot about it until the
first mix...and then we sorta looked around and said, "....oops."

                                                                jms
