     Never said they're all convinced of it.  Just as all Germans weren't
convined of the views advanced by Hitler.

     You don't need all of them.  You just need *enough* of them.

     Preferably, enough of them with guns.

     Remember, too, that we just came out of the Earth/Minbari War about ten
years ago, when we stood at the edge of extinction.  The threat of a new alien
race makes a good device.
