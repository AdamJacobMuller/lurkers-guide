     Other than GEnie...hrmmm...probably Compuserve.  As of this time, it's
the one area I tend to post about equal to GEnie; it has a decent offline
reader (Tapcis) that'll help save you lotsa dough...the science fiction media
area (sfmedtwo) has 2 areas set aside for B5 in messages and library...it's a
friendly place, absent the occasional troll, which is generally dealt with
fairly well.  Once the moderated rec arts b5 area is created, I'll be there as
well quite a bit.  In the interim, with GEnie long the unofficial home of B5
online fans, the first place that "noticed" us...I'll be here until they turn
off the lights.
