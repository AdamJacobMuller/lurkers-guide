     Just an addendum...the concerns I raised with the Creation people were
not on my own behalf, but upon those who come to the cons, voicing what I've
heard here and elsewhere.  It's their determination that they have fixed these
concerns that prompted me to give them a chance.  (If I weren't doing that con
that weekend, frankly, I'd probably stay home and try to recover).  Anyway,
it's not been an easy decision, but it's the only one that makes any kind of
sense at this time.

                                                                 jms
