     Make that two of us.

     Ah, well....

     BTW, if anyone would like to, oh, I dunno, get on a mailing list for the
Babylon 5 Newsletter (name to be announced soon), send a POSTCARD _ not a
letter, a postcard _ with your name and address to BABYLON 5 NEWSLETTER, c/o
Moonfire Productions, Box 2325, Oakhurst, CA  93644.

     Right now, we're shooting for mid-September for the first issue, around
the time we finish filming.

     It is now T-minus 6 and counting....

                                                                 jms
