     Hurm...actually...a word about Magicon....

     We finish shooting on September 4th.  There's likely to be a wrap party
that night.  Which means I'd either have to take the red-eye to be in Florida
by the next morning...or get a 5 a.m. flight out, either way arriving a wreck
for the Saturday presentation.

     Meantime, something else has come up.

     I've been contacted (again) by Creation Entertainment, and there have
been a number of phone calls between us.  I've been very straightforward about
my concerns, the things that I've heard from fans, all the things that I've
stated here on this forum.  They have gone out of their way to be
accommodating, and to make clear that they are aware that there have been
problems in the past, but that they have been corrected.

     So I'm going to give it a shot _ my suspicions intact _ and see how it
works out.  If it does, terrific, everybody wins.  If not...then at least it
was given a fair shot, and I have always tried to be fair.

     Consequently, to those of you in the San Francisco area...I'll be doing a
B5 presentation at the Creation Con over the weekend of September 5th and 6th.
(A short hop up to San Francisco is a LOT more palatable than an excursion
cross-country.)  I'll be able to bring a lot of neat stuff with me to show at
the convention.

     Now I have to let Magicon know.  And my regrets to those who may have
been anticipating the presentation there; I'd planned on just gritting my
teeth and, on the last day of shooting, getting no sleep and just bulling my
way through it...but I know I'm gonna be absolutely dead by then, and it's
just too much to put what's left of my body through at that point.

     T-minus 5 and counting.

                                                                jms
