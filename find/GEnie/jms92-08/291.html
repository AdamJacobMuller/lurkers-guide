     I'll be at Comic Con for a couple of days; I go for the shopping....

     Don't know yet about the other cons...as for the military, we're trying
to keep it correct.  As it happens, my Spousal Overunit is a military
historian (a *major* one, able to recite considerable information about every
major battle of the Civil War and discuss strategy in the Carthaginian battle,
you name it).  She's been very detailed in nagging me to stay correct when it
comes to this stuff.
