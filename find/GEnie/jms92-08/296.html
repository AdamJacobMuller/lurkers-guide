     No, if you were on the T-shirt list, you're already on the B5 newsletter
list.

     And while I'm thinking about it...Katherine...I've been running off at
the mouth here about how remarkable the EFX are that we're doing, but clearly
I have an agenda, and a stake involved, and there's no reason why anyone
should take my word for it (skepticism is a virtue).  Now, you've seen some of
the new FX...so as an objective voice, did you want to go into any detail
(without getting *too* specific) about what you saw, and what you feel is
different about it, or anything like that?
