     Some interesting things are happening re: the broadcast debut of the B5
pilot.  Good things.  Will advise.

     As to how Richard directs...pretty much like most directors, he walks
through the scene with the actor(s), having already a fairly clear idea in
mind how he wants to play the scene.  Blocks out each of hte _ the _ moves,
rehearses them a few times, and then shoots it.  Then goes in for coverage
(overs and unders, close-ups and mediums, that sort of thing).

     Day Two went quite well, after a slow start.  (A people mover we planned
to use _ nicknamed the  Being Mover, since it's used by others than humans _
didn't work out as well as planned, so rather than go with something less than
perfect, we scrapped it and yanked it...which took an hour or so, and then we
were able to get down to filming.)

     We used our Big Impressive Set today, and suspect it'll look pretty cool.
Also saw dailies from yesterday's filming, and for the first time the cast got
to see themselves on film, and see how it was being filmed, and they're all
*very* jazzed.  It looks like a motion picture.  Rich textures, nice use of
shadows, good depth of field...very nice.  The uniforms and prosthetics come
out wonderfully on film, and the performances are sparkling.  Some good drama,
and some *very* funny stuff as well.

     Anyway, all continues to go well.  We remain on schedule.  The cast is
happy.  Warners is happy.  We're happy.

     Onward.

                                                                  jms
