     By the way, if anyone's curious, here's how I'd rank the first six
episodes in terms of my own personal preference, from 1-6: "The Parliament of
Dreams," "Mind War," "Soul Hunter," "Born to the Purple," "Midnight on the
Firing Line," and "Infection."  We'll see how close this coincides with your
own reactions.
