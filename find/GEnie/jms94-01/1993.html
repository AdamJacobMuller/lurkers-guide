     (I'm keeping a low profile overall just now, to avoid getting in the
way...but quickly....)

     I *love* "Duck Dodgers."  I have virtuall all of the WB cartoons on tape
or disk, and from where I sit, that's wonderful stuff that'll be around for a
long, long time.  No omens, just something I thought would be fun.  (Again,
connecting past/present/future, sort of our B5 theme.)

     So far, so good...ratings in San Diego are a 9 rating with a 15 share,
beating all the network affiliates, delivering 150% over what the station
normally gets...this could bode *very* well.

                                                                  jms
