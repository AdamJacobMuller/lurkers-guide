     Thanks, all.  Matt...to your question, there's something I wish I could
tell you, but I can't without spoiling something in regards to the commander
running off all the time.  All I can say is watch the last act of "Infection."
You'll learn something very interesting there which impacts this discussion.
It's a scene between Garibaldi and Sinclair in the latter's quarters.  Believe
me, you'll know it when you see it.

                                                               jms
