     Re: magazines...I'm actively not cooperating with Starlog, so that takes
care of that venue.  There's deals in process for a comic, and for
novelizations, but I've kinda urged people not to hurry that process too much,
on the grounds of, "Let's do the *show* first, and make it as good as we can,
and *then* worry about the merchandising."  Too often people in this business
put the merchandising cart before the horse.  If we do our job right, then
there'll be plenty of all that down the road.  If not, why jump in and try to
exploit it?
