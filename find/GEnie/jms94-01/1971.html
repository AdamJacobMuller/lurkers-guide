     Logging on from the computer at work.  Still no power at home, so my
system there is dead.  So this'll be brief.  Terrible couple nights,
especially the Sunday, when the big one hit.  Lights out, blind terror, the
sound of plaster tearing and glass breaking and objects flying through the
room.  The house shaking as though in the maw of a large, terrible animal.
Fireplace fell down in the den, will probably have to rebuild the whole
fireplace.  Sundeck/patio is now separated from the house.  Massive cracks
elsewhere.  Dust and grit over everything.  To enter a room you have to clear
a path through debris...cd's, books, magazines, videotapes, everything's off
the shelves and on the floor, 6-12" deep.  Couldn't even open the office door,
blocked by debris.

     Fortunately, no injuries here or in the B5 crew/cast.  Andreas' house
took a major pounding, might be a total loss, we'll have to see.   Our
cinematographer (the same one who escaped the fire by inches) is in similar
straits.  We offered cast and crew the chance to stay home, but everyone
wanted to come in to work, get back on the horse again, show their support for
the show.

     More as I'm able.
