     BTW, in Larry DiTillio's latest edition of the "Scripts" column, in
Writer's Digest Magazine, there's a fairly lengthy section on B5.  For those
interested in hearing some stuff from another viewpoint than mine.

     Also look for some syndicated articles to appear in newspapers over the
next week, including the Tribune News Service, and the Teledata News service,
which between them cover something like 2,500 newspapers and magazine.  Also
the Boston Globe will have a piece on B5, as will Entertainment Weekly.
