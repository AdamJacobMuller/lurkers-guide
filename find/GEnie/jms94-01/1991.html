     It's *not* inconsistent.  There is a VAST difference between taking part
in a supervisory capacity in a business deal, and testifying in a courtroom on
a case where someone could be sent to jail for the rest of his or her natural
life.  Neither did I at any point indicate that any business use of a telepath
is useable in court.  It's something that one businessman pays for, to make
sure the other guy's on the up-and-up, not a legal thing.

     The right to privacy is a definite interest, yes...but to the courts, the
more significant issue is checks and balances, and an unwillingness to
surrender control of or influence over the judicial arm to  another government-
regulated agency with questionable military influences.

     There are many times that these and other laws may come into
conflict...and sometimes they won't be fair to all people at all times.   Our
government has a quit-smoking priority...and then goes out and underwrites
tobacco farmers.  There's an inconsitency for you.

                                                                 jms
