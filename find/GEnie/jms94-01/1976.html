      Well, the ratings are starting to come in.  We won't know the full
 story on the ratings until next week, because syndication doesn't work
 quite the same as network shows.  Some places are yet to air the first
 episode, and as with the ST shows, you add both airings to get a
 cumulative total.

      That said...we have some ratings/shares from the first night's
 single airings.  (By comparison, and I pass this along only as a
 benchmark, the ST shows generally get around an 8 or 9 rating and about
 an 11 share.  That's the *cumulative* rating, not a single-night rating.)

      So when you consider the following numbers, realize that they're
 not complete, and will increase maybe another 30% after the second
 airing (give or take).

      New York: 7.2 rating, 10 share.
      Los Angeles: 12 rating/17 share.
      San Francisco: 7.4 rating, 11 share
      Washington DC: 7.7 rating, 11 share
      Seattle: 10.4 rating, 16 share
      Minneapolis: 7.1 rating, 11 share
      Orlando: 8.8 rating, 16 share
      San Diego: 9 rating, 15 share
      Portland OR: 9.6 rating, 14 share
      Kansas City: 9.4 rating, 13 share

      In many markets, we beat in one night what it takes the ST shows
 two showings to pull, ratings-wise.  In many markets we beat network
 shows.  The LA showing beat "Beverly Hills 90210."  In some places, the
 ratings shot up 220% over what they normally get in that time period.

      Translation: we're not a success.

      We're a bona fide *hit*.

      Most significant of all are the quarter-hour breakdowns.  All the
 PR in the world might get you to tune into a show, but PR won't *keep*
 you there.  If the audience finds the show uninteresting, the numbers
 will fall each quarter hour.

      Practically across the board, the ratings either built or didn't
 change by quarter hours.

      To say that the people at Warner Bros./PTEN are stunned would be
 a considerable oversimplification.

      We did it.  Now the interesting thing will be to see if we can
 sustain it.  Onward and upward....
