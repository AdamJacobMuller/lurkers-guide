     The Starfuries are stored in the launch bays, yes.

     Re: Sinclair getting into a fighter...there were a number of reasons for
this, one of which being he wanted a good reason to avoid being in on the
counsel vote, given his marching orders.  But more than that...I would point
out that this isn't Star Trek, and Sinclair isn't Picard; he is first and
foremost a pilot.  He loves to get into a fighter and take it out  He's a
fighter.  That's when he is most at ease.  That's what his character *is*.

     At the same time, however, there are consequences for that kind of
behavior, as you point out.  And there are deeper reasons for what he is doing
than even he want to admit.  Tell you what...table that aspect until after
you've seen the last part of "Infection," which deals *with this exact issue*.


     Re: Vir...that was the first episode filmed with his character, and he
wasn't directed as well as he might have been.  We pulled him back a lot in
later episodes.
