     Snakes generally move slowly...until they strike.

     Re: the medical tools...we brought in a medical science consultant, who
helped us design our instruments.  His sense was that we're moving more and
more toward light as a system of treatment, non-invasive procedures, that sort
of thing.  No, there aren't anything like those devices in today's operating
rooms...but this is 250 years from now.  In any event, it *is* based on the
latest info we're getting on new science from our medical advisor.
