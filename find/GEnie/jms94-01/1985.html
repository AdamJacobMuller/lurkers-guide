     Re: not hearing thundering explosions...that's because there's no sound
in space.  We're trying to take a more *science* fiction approach to the show.
Along with the neat dynamics of motion in space, there has to be the
correlation in terms of how explosions are presented if the science is to have
any integrity.  Just an explanation for why a thing was done...in other shows,
in internal-station stuff, you'll get *plenty* on the sub-woofer.
