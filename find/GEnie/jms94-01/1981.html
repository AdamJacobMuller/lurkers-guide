     Our other directors are terrific.  There's Bruce Seth Green, who's done
an awful lot of work on various series (I think he also did some episodes of
V, btw), Jim Johnston, Janet Greek and Deborah Navarra (the first episode for
Deborah is coming up in the rotation soon).  I don't have their credits in
front of me, though I know Deborah's done a lot of Homefronts, and Janet comes
from a mainstream directing career, though she's an SF fan herself.  (Janet's
directing/has directed "And the Sky Full of Stars," "Chrysalis," "Raiding
Party," and our two-parter.  She's absolutely amazing.)

     Jim's done "Survivors," "Soul Hunter," "By Any Means Necessary," and will
likely do "Babylon Squared."  Bruce has done "Born to the Purple," "Mind War,"
and "Legacies" so far.

                                                              jms
