     There was a whole discussion about this over in Internet, and maybe
someone can grab that thread and put it all in here...suffice to say for now
that Psi Corps telepaths are ****NOT**** allowed to scan defendants in any
official way connected to a criminal act.  It violates the right  to due
process.  Even if requested, it's simply not allowed.  You do NOT want to even
open the door a *crack* in letting a government-regulated agency begin making
determinations about who is and isn't guilty of a crime.  That way lies
dictatorship, Thought Police and Big Brother.

     We'll get more into this question in an episode entitled "The Quality of
Mercy."
