     Sci-Fi Buzz was on the set this week, in fact, and did some quick
interviews with cast, me, and Harlan (who is returning to Sci-Fi Buzz as
commentator).  More on this when I get a date.

     Yes, much to my chagrin, I'm in the Making Of piece.  I hate me on
camera.  I get twitchy, my head disappears into my neck, my neck disappears
altogether, I suddenly gain about 20 pounds, and I look for all the world like
some kind of demented, myopic turtle.

     And yes, Bill Mumy is also in "Mercy," but has no scenes with June.

                                                                jms
