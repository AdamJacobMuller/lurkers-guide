     Fever broke a little today, so that helps.  May even go in to work for a
few hours tomorrow.

     Re: the Universe Today piece....sigh.  I wish they'd let us proof these
things before they sent them out.  That should be "Minbari POET accorded
honors," not "Minbari PIRATE."  I haven't had a chance to check out the
program yet -- no macs at home -- but plan to look at it as soon as I can.
There are a few glitches here and there apparently, plus in the electronic
trading card gifs, but easily straightened out.

                                                                 jms
