     Which episodes are central to the story arc?  I'd say the episodes that
you should keep in that regard would be "Soul Hunter," "The Parliament of
Dreams," "Mind War," "And the Sky Full of Stars," "Babylon Squared,"
"Chrysalis," and maybe "Legacies" and the two-parter, "A Voice in the
Wilderness."
