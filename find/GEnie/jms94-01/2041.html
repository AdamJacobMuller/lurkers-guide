     You may think it was obvious that the nephew was reading at gunpoint, and
in fact, he was...but thinking something or suspecting something isn't the
same as proving it.  Londo could say, "He was reading at gunpoint!"  And G'Kar
could say, "No, he wasn't."  Where do you go from there?  (And, in fact,
that's *exactly* what Londo said...only to have G'Kar deflect it.)

     Re: why Londo didn't show the clips...at this point, there's not any
question in anyone's mind about the attack taking place.  The Narns say they
were invited in to help quell internal strife.  That the events took place
isn't at issue; it's *why* and whether or not they were invited in.   (As with
Germany in WWII indicating that some places "invited" them in.)

     Had Sinclair shown the evidence, it probably would've just hardened
G'Kar.  Also, most politics is back-room dealing.  You do this in public, and
you make a terrible enemy who'll strike back as soon as he has a chance.  Let
him have his dignity, save face, BUT get what you want, and there's room to
maneuver in future.  It's the difference between being a punch'em-out hero,
and someone who has to be diplomatic, within limits.

                                                                jms
