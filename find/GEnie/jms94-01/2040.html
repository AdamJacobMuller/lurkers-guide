     My thought, at the time, was that if we play the reality of this for a
moment, probably *all* of the ambassadors have some kind of weapon, smuggled
in via diplomatic pouches.  Garibaldi and Sinclair know they're
there...question is, is it worth starting a diplomatic incident over, as long
as they're not being used?  Garibaldi is saying, in essence, "Okay, you know
it's there, and I know it's there, but now you've made a point about it.  Lose
it or hide it, or I'm going to have to charge you, and we're BOTH going to be
up to our ears in it."  If Garibaldi confiscated it, there'd be a whole
diplomatic hassle...and Londo would just have another one sent to him via
diplomatic pouch.
