     Added notes...1) B1-B3 weren't completed prior to going up; they were
sabotaged during construction at various points.  Only B4 was actually
completed.  2) Just a thought...you may want to take a gander at "Mind War" in
re: all the telepathy discussion.  You may walk away from that show with a
somewhat better understanding of the need to keep these people away from a
courtroom than I can convey here.
