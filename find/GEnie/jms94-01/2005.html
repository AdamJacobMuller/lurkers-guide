     Gold bars on the chest are for command staff, silver bars are for lower
command staff (i.e., Sinclair has gold, the techs in the observation dome have
silver).  As 2nd, Ivanova's bar is split, half gold and half silver.  Medical
division gets a red bar, Security gets a green bar.

     Rank are denoted in the brass pieces on the shoulder.
