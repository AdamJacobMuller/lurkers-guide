     Well, we've finished shooting "Legacies," and have begun shooting
"Raiding Party."  I think "Legacies" came out very well (guest-starring John
Vickery).  "Raiding Party" will guest star Gerrit Graham.

     We finally delivered "Chrysalis" to Warner/PTEN, and heard back: our
liaison over there was stunned, describes it as the best season-ending
cliffhanger he's ever seen, unlike anything done before.  Suffice to say we're
pleased.

     There's not a lot of CGI in either "Legacies" or "The Quality of Mercy"
(which will follow "Raiding Party" in the production lineup), because neither
story really called for it.  But there's a *lot* in "Raiding Party," some of
it very elaborate.  By way of comparison, in an average B5 episode, a script
from beginning to end has about 60 or 70 setups (a setup is a numbered scene
or shot, i.e., INT. SCOCKPIT or INT. ZEN GARDEN).  "Raiding Party" has around
112 setups.  That's more than in some movies.  It's a *very* busy script.

     We're now just about two weeks from our debut.  Lots of behind the scenes
action...meeting with journalists and some critics, buckets of interviews, and
a general sense of *anticipation* among the crew.  People are now either
seeing, or about to see what we've been quietly doing here ever since July.

     Once "Babylon Squared" is turned in, probably on Friday or Monday, there
will be just 4 scripts left to write (of which 2 are the two-parter).
 It seems like just yesterday we had 22 in front of us to write.  The time has
just zipped past with unparalleled speed.  It feels like it took forever to
GET the series, and suddenly before we really have a chance to think about it,
ZOOM, the first season is nearly over.

     This is going to be a very interesting few months....

                                                                 jms
