     Just completed another script, "The Quality of Mercy," which I wrote
almost entirely while down with the flu, and can literally not remember
writing any of it because of that.  Totally on autopilot, though it seems
pretty good.  (Might've been in Flemish, for all I knew.)  Also, we just cast
Gerrit Graham in "Raiding Party," which starts shooting next week, by which
time I hope to have "Babylon Squared" completed in first-draft form.

                                                                 jms
