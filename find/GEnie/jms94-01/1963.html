     On the topic of B5 being a novel for television, consisting basically of
five "books" (as Lord of the Rings was three books)...some figures for your
consideration.

     The total page number of script pages for season one: 1,100 (give or take
about 10-20 pages).  Basically two 550 page novels, or one very long (275,000
words) novel.

     At this point, it looks like the total for season one scripts written by
JMS is 12 scripts, or a total of about 600 pages (equal to a 150,000 word
novel).

     Assuming the show runs 5 years, that's 5,500 pages, equal to 11 average-
sized (100,000 words) novels.  Given that I'll probably continue to write
about half the scripts, that's 2,500 pages/5.5 novels just in JMS scripts.

     (Why do I suddenly feel very tired...?)

                                                                jms
