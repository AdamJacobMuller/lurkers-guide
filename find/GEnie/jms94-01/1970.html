     BTW...since we've been discussing script stuff here, a little bonus: from
1990-1991, I wrote a new 4-hour "V" miniseries, entitled "Rebirth."   It was
to be the comeback for the V series, until they realized that the show -- like
its predecessor -- would be too expensive to produce for syndication.  This is
the only official, Warners-sanctioned follow-up to the V series, even though
the script wasn't produced.

     I've gone ahead and uploaded the first three acts of that miniseries to
the SFTV library, file #893.  For those who followed the V story, you might
find this of some interest....
