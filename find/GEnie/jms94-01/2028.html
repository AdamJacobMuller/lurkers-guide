     I still plan to continue to go to cons, but probably at a somewhat
reduced level, simply due to the requirements of exec producing this show and
writing a smidge over half the episodes.  Probably hit the major cons,
WorldCon and the like.  And always, *always* ComicCon.

     Quake...ehhh.  Yeah, had some damage.  The fireplace in the living room
is now *IN* the living room...the chimney/fireplace has to come totally
down...a wall or so is going to be knocked out...there are cracks all over the
place...the sun deck is now separated from the front of the house, the stairs
leading up to the house are separated at one point... a closet is pretty much
demolished and will have to be yanked and re-done...lots of other minor
damage...couldn't get into my office for about a day because of the debris
piled up in front of the other side of the door...didn't have power from
Sunday night through Thursday, only today was told that the water's
okay...spent most of the nights writing scripts on a notebook computer by
flashlight....

     It hasn't been pretty around here for a while.

                                                                  jms
