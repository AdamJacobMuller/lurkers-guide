     Actually, there are newer black leather B5 jackets, which we made up for
cast and crew for Christmas, as a gift.  They're *gorgeous* black leather-and-
cloth letterman jackets, with a slightly redone B5 logo on the back (better
metallic thread for the sunburst, some other minor variations).  Mine has
something a little extra: the patches worn on the uniforms of those who fought
at the Battle of the Line.  A Starfury patch on the left arm, squadron
name/number on the right arm, EA Command  Patch with name on the left breast,
Earthforce Off Worlds patch on the right breast.  Very, very cool.

     BTW, a request for a favor: reviews are going to be coming out this week
on our first episode.  I know they're slated to appear in People,
Entertainment Weekly, and TV Guide.  (Apparently Jarvis will be doing a
review, about which he would only say to some people, "It's *brief*," which
sounds like another hatchet job in the offing.)  I know that the East Coast
gets deliveries of these magazines a few days before they arrive here on the
West Coast.  If anyone sees these (or other) reviews prior to Tuesday, lemme
know, and post as much as you can from it.  Thanks.

                                                              jms
