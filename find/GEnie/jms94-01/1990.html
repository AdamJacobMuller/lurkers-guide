     1) The markings are on top of the starfuries, not beneath.  The
"disappearances" you refer to are shots in which we're looking UP at the
fighters.

     2) Re: the Psi Corps...let's have a moment of logic for a moment.   Does
anyone here think that the Judicial System will, for a *moment*, let another
government agency come into their courts with pronouncements of guilt or
innocence?  Lawyers wouldn't have it, judges wouldn't have it, the Supreme
Court would rule against it.  Also, please remember that the Corps is viewed
with some measure of suspicion by the rest of the government.  As you'll see
in the course of the series.  They aren't perceived automatically as the Good
Guys.

     You MUST set up checks and balances, and policies.  You can't say,
"Okay, a telepath can scan sometimes, but not others, with some people, but
not others."  The law is a defined creature.  A telepath *may not* scan
someone accused of a crime, and have that as admissible evidence.  A telepath
*may* scan a victim who is unable to remember the events of a crime,
BUT...that is not admissible in its own terms, it must then be bolstered with
actual, physical evidence.  Even an eyewitness testimony can be challenged,
and hearsay evidence is open to challenge as well, there are *already*
limitations on second-party testimony.

     Allowing the Psi Corps to function within a criminal court setting is one
step removed from tyranny, and a government controlled court.  If you actually
look at the *reality* of it...it wouldn't happen.  And that is the position
we're taking with our series.  Is it debateable?  Of course it's open to
debate.  We like fostering debate.  Is everything fair?  No, it's not, just as
in life.  But as someone said (actually, the person looking on over my
shoulder as I type this), it's my show....
