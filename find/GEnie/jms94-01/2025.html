     Since I sat on a panel with Niven, who said that in his view nothing good
is written for TV, and implied basically that TV writers were people who'd
sold out and were just a shade above prostitutes in the food chain, I doubt
very much that Niven would be interested in writing scripts, nor would I be
terribly much inclined to ask.
