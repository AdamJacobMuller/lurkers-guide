     PPG = Phased Plasma Gun, and yes, the settings work about the way you
describe.  At full settings, it burns right through the body (and you can see
this in some shots, albeit briefly and discreetly).  We also deal with the
reality of what such a weapon *does* to you...internal burns, clothes melting
into the skin, that sort of thing.  We don't get gross about it, but we try to
stay with the reality of what we're creating.
