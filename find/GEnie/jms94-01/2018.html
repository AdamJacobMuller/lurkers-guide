     Did we save anything for the rest of the season?  Lemme put it to you
this way...you ain't seen *nothin* yet.  "Midnight" makes just about
everything done before for TV look lame...but there's stuff coming down the
pike that'll make "Midnight" look pale by comparison.  With each show we get
better, we learn more, and we can *do* more.

                                                                  jms
