     This kind of comment is really pointless now because the show is about to
hit the air.  Lots of people have been badrapping it during the months of
waiting.  Now you get to see for yourself, and all this "it ain't great" stuff
will be shown for the BS it is.  If you've seen it, judge for yourselves.
They're full of it.

     It's dismaying that we've gotten to this point of, if we're not wasting
millions of dollars on EFX, it can't be any good.  Wrong.
