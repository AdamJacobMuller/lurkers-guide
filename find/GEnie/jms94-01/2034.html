     We've re-lit and touched up the forced perspective to make it look
better.

     Also, Ron did *substantial* modifications to the B5 station itself,
making it the biggest single object to render.  It has something like (and
this is only my memory) 100 times the resolution of the station used in the
pilot, so you can get right in close for paint-scraper shots.  It's much more
detailed and substantial looking.

                                                                  jms
