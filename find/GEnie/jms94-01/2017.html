     Don't know if Ron's named that ship or not; will try to remember to
inquire.

     Advance word: look for a big story in Entertainment Weekly, probably
hitting the stands next week (the following week latest); stories via the
Tribune and Teledata syndicators; we got the cover in the L.A. TIMES Sunday
color TV magazine for the week we air; other newspapers will be doing the same
(specifics when and if I get them).  Expect to see pieces on CNN and Showbiz
Today over the next 2 weeks, and Starburst should have a very long piece on
the show sometime soon.

                                                                  jms
