     Cooney: I wasn't offended...very little offends me...EXCEPT THIS DAMNED
FLU THAT REFUSES TO GO AWAY, AND EVERY NIGHT IT'S FEVER TIME, AND I'M GOING
OUT OF MY MIND, YOU HEAR?  I'M GOING MAD!  I'M SPENDING MY DAYS AND NIGHTS
TRYING TO WRITE IN TWO STATES OF MIND: DELUSIONAL OR CONFUSED (which on the up
side is one more state of mind than is normal for me) AND I'M TIRED OF IT, YOU
HEAR?  TIRED OF IT!
