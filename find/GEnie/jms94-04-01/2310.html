     Personal request: could some enterprising SFWA member here, who might've
archived the "Ellison vs. Platt" topic in the SFWA category, send me the whole
thing in email?  Confidentiality 100% assured.  It's for a non-networked
member.

     (Any SFWA member who objects...take it to email.  Not that I'll be the
least concerned, of course, I'd just rather not have it clogging this topic.)

                                                                  jms
