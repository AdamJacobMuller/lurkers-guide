     Bear in mind, Sinclair was only out about 24-48 hours (I don't recall the
exact number).  So it wasn't that long a period of time in which to arrange a
prisoner transfer.

     Pathman...your perception comes from a slight advantage: you're here.
This has been discussed in great detail on-line, and in the various faq files,
and in my individual postings.  (About Sinclair and the Line.)  But this
group, for all its other wonderfulnesses, comprises not enough people to make
a hiccup on the ratings.  Unless off-line viewers saw the pilot MOVIE -- and
not all of them did -- this is their *first introduction* to the fact that
there was a missing 24 hours at ALL.  Most of them didn't have that prior
knowledge in order to HAVE the suspicions.

     As much as I like the online environment, one can't tailor a show  around
prior knowledge gained through this exchange.  We have to bring everyone along
*together*.

                                                                  jms
