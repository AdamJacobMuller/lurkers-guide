     Stories become more problematic in direct proportion to the complexity of
the suggestion.  If it's a one-liner, or a brief thought, that's not too
problematic.  If it's a lengthy discussion of a possible story...THAT'S a
problem.  It lets someone say, "Hey!  My story had 52 specific notions, and 52
of those are in his story, so I wuz robbed."   It's really a question of
degree, courtesy and intent.

     And the writing credit on MOTFL was jms.
