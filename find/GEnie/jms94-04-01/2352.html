     As another aside...I'm surprised no one here has mentioned what
transpired just recently on CI$.  A couple of people were posting their
version of what they thought ST 7 was going to be about, in some detail, and
Paramount jumped in on jackboots and started threatening lawsuits, against the
people, against CI$, against everyone and anyone involved.   There may even
have been an injunction.  In any event, the lawyers descended en masse and
stomped on it hard.

                                                                 jms
