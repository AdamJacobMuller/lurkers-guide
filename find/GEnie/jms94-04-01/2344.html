     No one has seen the entire series outline.  Three people have seen a ten-
page synopsis of the full five-year story, and are sworn to absolute secrecy
about it.  Larry, as I mentioned earlier, read it, and his first reaction was,
"You're out of your f*****g mind."  A second person began crying at the end of
it.  (Honest to god, I'm not making this up.)  The synopsis contains only the
broad strokes; not the details, and there's a LOT of odd stuff in the details.


     In preparation for a (hopeful) second season, I've broken out the
individual episodes/stories for year two, and let one person skim through the
breakdown, only in order to determinen production needs in advance, so we can
budget accordingly.  That's all.
