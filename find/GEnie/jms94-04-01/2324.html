     The zero-g cargo section extends from the front of B5 well into the
middle of the station, *inclusive* of red sector, which is below it.

     I'm never optimistic.  As far as pickup is concerned, it's very
basic...the Paramount network, as stated, is making inroads, pressuring
stations to sign onto the new network or else they won't get the proven,
guaranteed, franchise, new ST series.  Independent stations only have so many
available hours, which is putting a real crunch on the syndicated marketplace.
Whatever people may think, a second season is not a lock.  I wouldn't have
asked people to express their support, *especially* to the local stations,
just to jerk people around.  I take that kind of request very seriously, and
wouldn't ask unless I felt it was useful.

     I am hopeful, and certainly there are many positive signs...but at the
same time, as I've said before, this is one town where hope can kill you.

                                                               jms
