     Unless you're planning to do monstrous amounts of blue-screen work,
making stars go left to right (or right to left) is easy; ST uses a star
curtain, which simply is on a loop running in the right direction (when they
don't use blue screen).  Stars out of the B5 window would be going in a
CIRCLE...which would require a star WHEEL of *enormous* size.  We were able to
trick the camera using camera moves in the pilot to make the stars move, but
have found it more difficult to do this on the series.  We have some ideas on
how to fix this for a (hopefully) second season.

                                                                     jms
