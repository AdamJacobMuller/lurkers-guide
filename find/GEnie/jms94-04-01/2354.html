     Cindy: your recollection is incorrect.  The story was *not* the real one,
so saith the people who were posting it.  They were just making it up.

     Legally, this is a very muddy and difficult area.  Which is why I have
generally avoided getting into it here.  There are always some who, upon
getting a request like this, want to drag out the legalities of why they
should or shouldn't go along with it, who says they can't do it... when from
my perspective, why are we getting into the legalities of it?  I ask it as a
*courtesy*.  I spend 3+ hours a day on these systems, and as a rule of thumb I
never ask much in return.  Even when I'm blind tired after a long day, and I
log on to find (as today) 1,075 message in my mailbox, I still make it a point
to come in every day, read everything in both B5 topics, and respond as much
as I can...and the only thing that I ask in exchange, as a courtesy,
understanding that it's a difficult area, is to refrain, where possible, from
posting significant or detailed story ideas.
 I don't see why legalities have to be argued over each time this gets brought
up.  One can argue the merits and the specifics and the letter of the law ad
infinitum...all I've said is that if they *do* start popping up here, I'll
have to excuse myself from the discussion.

     Anyone who wants to engage in elaborate story speculations and ideas can
do so privately, in email, to your heart's content.  All I ask is that you not
do it where I can see it.  I don't like having to make the request, would
*much* prefer not to do so, but the flat bottom line is that we are a lawsuit
happy country, and I cannot expose myself, my show, and PTEN to that kind of
risk.  (And please don't go over the realease form and promises discussion all
over again...we've hashed and rehashed that one, and it doesn't work.)

     Most people in this town can't believe the amount of effort that I put in
here, in an exchange which, from a strictly numerical point of view, wouldn't
notch the ratings up a fraction of a point.  But to me, it's important.  I'm
just trying to minimize the amount of danger to which I expose my show.  If
the show matters, then the request matters.

                                                              jms
