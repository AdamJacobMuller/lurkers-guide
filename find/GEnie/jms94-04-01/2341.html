     Since they apprently scan this topic...could someone here please notify
the pinheads at the Prydonians of Prynceton that the Compton's CD Rom of B5 is
not being done by Richard Compton, B5 director; that it is being done by the
same people who put out Compton's Multimedia Encyclopedia; that Richard
Compton was also NOT the head of the B5 special effects department...and while
you're at it, suggest they find a new topic for their top ten...unless they're
willing to incorporate poor journalism, inaccurate fact checking and typos.
