     Still plan on showing "Signs and Portents" at I-CON, though it'll be
tight getting that one finished in time, given the incredible amount of CGI in
it.  Also will be doing a panel there with Harlan, Michael O'Hare and Arne on
the origins of B5, and a one-man Q&amp;A session/workshop on writing for TV.
