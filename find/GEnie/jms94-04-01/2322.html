     We expect to know around the second week of May.  Because of the recent
entry of Paramount's new network, which is grabbing up stations left and
right, nothing in the current marketplace is a lock, so we'll see what we will
see.  They're really hoping that ST spinoff #3 will be sufficient bait --
offering the guaranteed ST franchise -- to help close down other venues and
other competing shows.

                                                                  jms
