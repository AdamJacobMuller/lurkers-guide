     It has *always* been my sense that the body was slipped out an access
airlock in the zero-g cargo area.  Every other access -- like the boarding
area and standard cargo area -- is under close security to prevent this kind
of thing, or the influx of contraband.  There's really nowhere to GO from the
zero-g section, so it's a little looser.  As for how he got the body
there...there is an answer, and a reason, and if you look at this episode
again after the season is over, even the nitpickers who brought it up will be
able to figure it out.  I didn't address it in the issue because I didn't
think anyone would make a federal case out of this, and for other reasons that
will in time become apparent.  Several other nits picked at this episode will
*also* be clarified by season's end.  It's not easy to sit quietly, knowing
the answer, and being unable to tell it, but that's simply what I have to do
for the time being.

                                                                   jms
