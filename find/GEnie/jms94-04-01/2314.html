     Actually, no, I don't believe John Flinn was our DP on the pilot movie.
The series is a *tad* lighter than the pilot, but not much.  Re: the grainy
aspect...this is happening *after* we turn over the episodes on digital (D2)
format.  Apparently the company that PTEN uses to drop in the commercials (one
dub), do the closed captioning (another dub) and other stuff (total: five
generations down) was doing so on *analog one inch tape*...and, we recently
discovered, using *USED STOCK*.  Neither PTEN nor anyone else noticed this or
was aware; we noticed the substantial difference in picture and audio quality,
and began backtracking it and found this out.  Starting with "War Prayer"
we've been able to correct some of this (with considerable yelling), and will
in time correct the rest.  Also, some TV stations are downlinking to less than
effective stock, which doesn't help.  The image that leaves here on D2 is VERY
sharp, with nicely saturated colors.

                                                                  jms
