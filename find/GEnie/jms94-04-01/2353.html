     I would like to know the 3 times that the specific line, "There's a
shuttle leaving in two hours, be on it" was used.  I know of only one: in
"Mind War."  G'Kar said to the assassin, in "Parliament," "That's your flight,
I suggest you hurry," *in answer to a PA notice, but that's not the same thing
by any measure.  Please cite the three times you say this exact phrase was
used.  Because I don't think it's there.
