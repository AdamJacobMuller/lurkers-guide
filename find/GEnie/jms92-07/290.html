     Catherine Adair ended up with another gig, so we now have Ann Bruice, who
was tied in our decision for a costumer for the pilot, but in that case she
was busy on another project.  Now she's available, and she is doing *terrific*
work.  Just amazing stuff...her work on the Grey Council is particularly nice.

     Tim: no one's said a word about it to us, and I don't think it'll really
have an effect on us, one way or another.

     Probably late summer.  We have an awful lot of time before airdate, so
there's really no rush to get the cameras running, which is nice.
