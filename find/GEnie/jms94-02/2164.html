     Just one note...as I mentioned in my reply to your email, Torville, I
have received and waded through literally *thousands* of critiques of B5, from
the pilot to the first two episodes.  In all but maybe 5-6 of those, I keep my
mouth shut.  The only time I can't avoid the tendency to respond is if I see
something that I think is unfair, as I felt your message was unfair.  (And
again in your latest, that the ship being on a collision course "doesn't
advance the story."  That's simply silly.   The soul hunter is unconscious at
the start.  Thus, his ship has to be on autopilot.  Thus if it comes in, once
it's past the gate, it's out of control.  Sure, I suppose that I could've had
it flying off at a whole different tangent, or just laying there in
space...but this is a series with some measure of *action* to it.  I like to
keep a good pace going.   Pacing is part of the story, advances the story.
Thus it *does* advance the story.)

     I have accepted, without comment, a *lot* of things that I disagreed
with...sometimes holding to my own original view, sometimes altering my views
when someone hits me over the head with a fact.  But I reserve the right,
every 3,000 messages or so, to get, as you say in your signature, "miffed."
And I'd note that *you* got miffed after just *one* critique of something you
wrote...try 3,000 on for size some time.

                                                               jms

     ("I can see you're really upset about this, Dave...Dave...?)
