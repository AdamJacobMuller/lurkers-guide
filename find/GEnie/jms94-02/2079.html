     P.S.  Just as a reminder to anyone looking on...before we began airing
episodes, I posted my list of favorite episodes of the first six.
 I'll repost that here now:

     1) "The Parliament of Dreams"
     2) "Mind War"
     3) "Soul Hunter"
     4) "Midnight on the Firing Line"
     5) "Born to the Purple"
     6) "Infection"

     Plugging in the addition of two new episodes that'll be aired after "Mind
War," I'd put the new lineup of the first eight in this order of personal
favorites:

     1) "The Parliament of Dreams"   
     2) "And the Sky Full of Stars"       (A tie with "Parliament")
     3) "Mind War"
     4) "Soul Hunter"
     5) "Midnight on the Firing Line"
     6) "Born to the Purple"
     7) "The War Prayer"
     8) "Infection"

     I think that the first list comes pretty close to the majority of views
I've seen expressed here thus far.  We'll see more after the next two air.

                                                             jms
