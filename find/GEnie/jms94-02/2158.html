     Speaking of handing someone a hot potato, if you think this one is a
toughie, just wait for "Believers."  Yikes.

     What the soul was, who's right, and even whether this is SF or Science
Fantasy, was it explained enough to merit one over the other... how can I put
this...?  I don't want to spoon-feed stuff to people.  What I want is not to
hit someone with a MORAL, or a message, or "This is what a soul is," or "This
is what makes it an SF series," I want to start discussions.  Arguments.
Preferably a bar fight or two.

     We present an issue.  Here are the sides.  Now...what do YOU think about
it?  I want this show to ask, "Who are you?  Where are you going?"  That's
half the fun.  Some of my favorites pastimes in college were sitting in the
commons, or the library, arguing this stuff from every possible angle.  You
think I'm gonna tell you what to think?  What it means?  No.  The goal is to
provoke discussion.  Preferably passionate discussion.

     Otherwise I might as well just start renting billboards and putting up
signs.
