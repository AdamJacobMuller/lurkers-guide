     The Xon?  Dead.  All of them.  And good riddance.

     RE: the glasses...it's not something I've been able to figure out how to
mention, but the Narn pride themselves on their physical perfection.  Hence
there is no market for physical aides; it's something to be ashamed of.  So
they have to crib stuff from other species, like glasses that have a
prescription close enough to be useful.

     I have *no* idea how to work that into a script, and am not sure it is
even a good idea to do so.

     Kosh was otherwise engaged....
