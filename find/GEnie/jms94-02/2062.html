     I watch *every* version.  I watch the daililes.  I look at the director's
cut.  Then John Copeland and I go in to make the producer's cut.  We watch it
again a few times, futzing with it as we go.  I watch the on-line version.  I
watch the color-corrected version.  I watch it again after we've added in the
SFX.  I watch it while we spot the episode (determing where music and sound
effects go).  I watch it again when we do the mix-down to add music and sound.
I watch it again to make sure it's all cohesive, on my home system, to make
sure it translates okay (we mix in a fancy sound stage, with killer speakers,
which most folks won't have).
