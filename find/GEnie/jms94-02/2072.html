     Groups like the Grey Council, the Bene Gesserit, and others are part and
parcel of mythology...whether it's the council of the gods, the twelve
apostles, the councils of wizards and elves in Lord of the Rings...they are
consistent with the myths we have created for ourselves, and thus pop up all
over the place.  (Did I mention the Round Table of Camelot?)
