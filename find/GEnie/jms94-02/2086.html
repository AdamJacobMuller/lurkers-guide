     It depends; in most places, it's held solid, other places it dips if
there's something of local interest on another channel (i.e., a local sporting
event), other places it's gone up.  As long as it stays overall within a point
or two of the goal, if it generally builds over the previous hour, and the
demographics are good (which they are), you're in good shape.  There's a *LOT*
of variance in syndicated ratings.

     Needless to say, though, we got *creamed* by the Tonya/Nancy Show.
Which got a 64 share, the 3rd biggest ratings for a sporting event in history.
But then, *everybody* got beat up by that one, so again it's okay.
