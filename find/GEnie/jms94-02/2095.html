     Nope, we don't do the threaten-ambassadors stuff much; in fact, as I
think of it, that *might* be the last real biggie, though certainly they get
into considerable trouble from time to time in other ways.  That's too easy a
story, thus it behooves us not to do it overmuch.

     And like I said...I have problems with "Infection" as well, so there is
no flame from me.  I guess part of it is knowing what was in the script that
should've been carried off better, but wasn't.  And part of it is my fault; I
tried to use the Nelson/machine as a metaphor; it wasn't supposed to be about
the Nelson/machine, but about the kind of people who would create it, the kind
of people who would sell it, and the kind of people who would confiscate it
even KNOWING what it was (and of course the kind of people who would *use*
it).  Unfortunatly, when you put  somebody in that kind of suit, that
*becomes* the story, and from that point on you're pretty much doomed.  It was
also in places too much an obvious metaphor, and the "hand of the author" is
showing too much.  It was the first script written for this season, after the
long break after the pilot, and I think I was trying to find the characters'
"fingerprints" and getting into the flow of the series, which took a script or
two.

                                                                jms
