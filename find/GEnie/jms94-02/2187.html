     The "stay put" line was ad-libbed by Andreas, because the crawfish kept
crawling off the table.

     Re: G'Kar being theatrical...that's who he is.  I like theatrical
characters.  I know many in real life that're much bigger than life, very
broad...and great fun.  Not every character has to be sonorous and serious and
restrained.  The whole point of *having* alien characters is that they should
act differently than the majority of us.
