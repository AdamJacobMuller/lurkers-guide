     I'd be inclined to ask your friend at the store to hold back any such B5
vs. DS9 debate until we've aired the first season.  Otherwise it's really not
very fair.  It's like comparing two books, one of whom you've read completely,
the other of which you've read only the first couple of chapters.

                                                              jms
