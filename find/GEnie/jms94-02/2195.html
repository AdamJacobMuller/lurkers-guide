     BTW, re: Sinclair remembering all those names...we used many of the real
names of the people standing in line, many of whom *did* belong to the
religion they had come to represent.  We went down this line of 250 people,
and went over their names *twice* with O'Hare.  That's all.  After that, he
got each name right every time; amazingly quick memorization.

                                                                jms
