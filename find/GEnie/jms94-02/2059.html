     What a weird day...filming "Babylon Squared," and one minute I'm standing
in the anteroom/hallway of a Minbari cruiser that leads into the Great Hall
and the chambers of the Grey Council...a few minutes later I'm standing in a
section of Babylon 4, and the whole atmosphere of the crew is *very*
different, the whole sensibility is strange...very strange.

     Just cast Theodore Bickell in an episode entitled "TKO," written by Larry
DiTillio.  Also Greg McKinney appears in that episode.

     Finished writing the second half of our two-parter, "A Voice in the
Wilderness."  We go off the station for this one.

     Just one last episode to write, and we're finished with the scripts for
this season.  How weird.  Seems like we barely started.  Finishing filming on
#17.

     "Babylon Squared" has a *very* different look to it, and a very eerie and
foreboding feel about it, which I like a lot.  Jim Johnston, who directed
"Soul Hunter" and several others is doing it.  Very moody.
