     Sure, I could've gotten them into bed by the second act...but that wasn't
the point.  What I wanted to show, what interests me, is the give and take
leading up to that moment, the feints and parries and "how do we get past
this?"  That to me is some of the most interesting stuff in a relationship.

     Re: the newspaper...it's not printed in conventional fashion.  You
program in your interests, and every morning a pre-filtered copy of UT is
printed up in your quarters, on synthetic recycleable material.  You ript it,
carry it, toss it.  Very simple, and probably within our own grasp in the next
5 years.

     (I.e., imagine a computer set to scan the wire services, look for certain
keywords, download the articles, and during the night load the articles into a
pre-set design format and automatically print them up on your laser printer so
they're waiting in the morning.)

     I didn't say that Earth was the ONLY one with diverse religions.  I don't
understand why it is that when ONE thing is shown, it means that's the ONLY
thing.  It's not.  Narns, as we'll see in "By Any Means Necessary," have
several competing beliefs.  The idea of the festival wasn't to compare and
contrast, only to show what *we* (whoever *we* is) believes.

                                                                jms
