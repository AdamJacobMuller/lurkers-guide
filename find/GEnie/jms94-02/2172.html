     John...when you go around shooting off your mouth and calling names and
making cheap shots, you're going to have someone hand you your head from time
to time.

     There seems to be this perception of BBS etiquette as, "I can say
anything I want about you, be as unfair as I like, but if you call me on it,
if you respond in the same kinds of terms I use, then that's being
unprofessional."

     But then there have always been people who don't like it when the target
fires back.

                                                                   jms
