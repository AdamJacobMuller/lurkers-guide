     I think it would've done better as a Short Subject.

     Sorry; there's no one more critical of my work than me, and when it comes
to "Infection," I'd just kinda prefer it if it kinda vanished in the night.  I
feel that way about only two episodes out of 22, so that's not too bad, I
suppose.  But in any event, I don't think there's *nearly* enough there to
make into a two-parter.

                                                                   jms
