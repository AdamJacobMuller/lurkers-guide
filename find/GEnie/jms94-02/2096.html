     Mike: for you to say that the racism issue is one that has been beaten to
death in the last X-years, that including it in the first 22 episodes is "a
sad tale:"

     I live in L.A.  Does the name Rodney King ring a bell?  Or the L.A.
riots?

     Maybe you don't like the treatment of an issue -- that's fine -- but I
reserve the right to try and address issues that I consider important.   Maybe
you think it's been said.  But it bears repeating.  As someone once noted, "Of
course everything has already been said.  But since no one was listening, we
must begin again."
