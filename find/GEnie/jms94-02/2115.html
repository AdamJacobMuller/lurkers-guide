     For the most part, lower level types don't know the names of those in the
Grey Council (speaking of Minbari for a moment).  They are kept fairly
anonymous to avoid the cult of personality arising.  You'll see the full
extent to which they preserve their anonymity in some of the upcoming
episodes, specifically "Sky" and "Babylon Squared."
