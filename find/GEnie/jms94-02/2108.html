     (Trying to run it all through my head...I don't think we see Kosh for a
while...he's not in "Mind War," not in "The War Prayer" or in "Sky," and the
first one up after reruns is, I believe "Believers," in which Kosh *does* make
an appearance, being as cryptic as ever.  We tend to use Kosh sparingly.  The
one story in which he plays a significant role and has a lot of on-camera time
is "DeathWalker."  He's also in "Grail," and "Chrysalis," and some others,
though they slip my mind at the moment.)
