     I'll have to check to see about the glitches; we've tracked down the
technical difficulties further, and discovered (among other things) that after
we'd delivered the episode, at one stage along the way they were being
transferred to 1" *used tape*.  Add in going from D2 to 1" and from that 1" to
others to do closed captioning and commercials, and you're bound to get some
weird stuff.  Starting next week, episodes will be going out with most of the
transfer work done on D2, not 1", so they should be cleaner henceforth.

                                                                jms

     (If you could be as specific as possible on where the glitch is, I can
check our master vs. the broadcast master.)
