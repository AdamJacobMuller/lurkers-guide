     Because we deal with religion a *lot* in this first season, we're giving
it a break...but yes, there is some cross-fertilization.  I'd written a scene
for one script, cut for time, featuring an alien in Catholic collar, a priest.
And there should be humans who'd get into alien religions that are thousands
of years older than our own.

                                                                 jms
