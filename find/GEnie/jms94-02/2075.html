     Okay...here's a request for a favor.

     As of this week, "Infection" is more or less past us, and now two of our
better shows are coming up; two real favorites, "The Parliament of Dreams" and
"Mind War."  These give a much better sense of what this show is *really*
capable of doing.  (BTW, add "Raiding Party" and "Babylon Squared" to my list
of favorites from this season; the former shows that you can come damned close
to the level of action-oriented space EFX in "Return of the Jedi" in TV.
Really amazing stuff.)

     Anyway...if there are people you know who haven't given the show a look,
or have been uncertain...these are the shows to have them watch.   You can
tell commend these two episodes to them without reservation.  If you would
want to convey that to those you know, we'd appreciate it.  This is really a
chance were B5 can shine.

                                                                 jms
