     No, I don't think there's a 100% correlation; sometimes a show is
absolutely awful, and is panned appropriately.  Sometimes a show tries to
introduce a paradigm shift, and gets unfairly nailed.  And all of the other
possibilities in-between.

     I have learned from this experience one very important lesson: no matter
what you do, somebody'll gig you for it.  If you put in action, they'll say
the show has nothing to say and is shallow; if you put in esoteric stuff,
they'll say it's pompous; if you spend time building your characters, they'll
say it's slow; if you do a complex plot, they'll say there's no
characterization; if you have no EFX, they'll say you're cheap; if you put in
lots of EFX, they'll say you're just doing the old razzle-dazzle with nothing
of substance...and on and on and on.

     So, fundamentally, the only thing you can do is keep doing what it is
you're doing, and be patient, letting people gradually see the full picture of
what you're doing.  (Oh, yeah, and if you start off going for ambitious stuff,
they'll say you're confusing; if you start gradually and work your way into
the more complex stories after you've introduced the world and the characters,
they'll say you're not innovative.)

     I am content to be patient, and to continue telling the story I want to
tell.
