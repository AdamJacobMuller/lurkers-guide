     They don't.  Never said they did.  Centauri have a pantheon.  The Narns
(as we'll see in "By Any Means Necessary") have several different competing
religions.  Only two religions -- Centauri and Ikarran -- have a similar
historical thread in the Great Maker, with the small addition of those worlds
conquered by the Centauri which have adopted Centauri religion (or been forced
to do so, as has happened here on our own world).
