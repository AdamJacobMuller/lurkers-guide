     Correct; the distortion you're seeing is caused by superheating the air.
When it collapses again -- the heat literally burns through the atmosphere,
the same as lightning -- it would logically make a sound like a small
thunderclap...so we sampled some thunder sounds, and interlaced some of the
PPG sound with that as well.

                                                               jms
