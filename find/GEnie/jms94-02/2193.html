     There was a follower of Islam; right next to the orthodox jew at the
front of the line.  "Mr. Rashid, a Moslem."  I made sure we put them side by
side.

     The "fishy" song was composed by Christopher Franke specifically for that
scene.  I told him I wanted sort of a Narnish Gilbert and Sullivan, and that's
what we got.

     Re: the camera moves...I really have no idea what your friend is talking
about.  Virtually all of our sets are constructed for full 360 degree camera
movement (and we do have a few cases of full 360 degree pans coming along).
This is not, however, a "cutty" show...some shows, presuming that their
audience has the attention span of your average gnat, lean toward fast-fast-
fast- cutting and editing and swishing camera moves.  We *hate* that.  We're
trying to set a mood, not turn the show into an MTV music video.  (Miami Vice
was a terrific example of this kind fo thing.)
