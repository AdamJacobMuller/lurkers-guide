     Oh, god, did the Dance Theater of Harlem line get in there?  I don't
believe it....

     Yes, you'll see places in the show where they can and do congregate; the
briefing room, the conference room, the mess hall...the observation dome is a
place to *do* stuff, not so much talk about stuff.

                                                                 jms
