     John Drew: regarding your note that naming the starliner the Asimov is
"not original" and "cliche"...I deeply admired Asimov.  Harlan Ellison, this
series consultant, was as dear a friend to Asimov as anyone could be.
 I named the starliner after Asimov shortly after his death, because I will
personally miss him, and for Harlan, as his friend.

     So regarding your "cliche" line...not to put too fine a point on it,
screw off.  Get your own damned show.  This is mine.  The starliner originally
was named something else.  If I choose, as an expression of loss, to name this
ship after him, that's my right.  As far as I am concerned, that is the end of
this discussion.

                                                                jms
