      Here's the tentative schedule for episodes past "Mind War," which
 airs in three weeks:

      March 9 -  "The War Prayer," by D.C. Fontana
        "   16 - "And the Sky Full of Stars," by jms
        "   23 - "Deathwalker," by Larry DiTillio
        "   30 - "Believers," by DAvid Gerrold
      April 6  - "Survivors," by Marc Scott Zicree

      At first it looked like there was going to be a batch of reruns
 after "Mind War," but PTEN is so happy with the ratings that they do NOT
 want to interfere with the momentum.  Which makes me very happy as well.

                                                                 jms
