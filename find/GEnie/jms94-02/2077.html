     Dana: please list for me any promises that I have not kept.  I have
spoken about the series overall, and I have spoken about those individual
episodes that I think are terrific.  I said that "Sky" would be like a leap
ahead of most anything produced for american SF-TV before. And I stand by
that.  "Sky" hasn't aired yet.  It will in 4 weeks.  I said that I liked
"Soul," loved "Parliament" and "Mind War," and wasn't terribly big on
"Infection," with "Midnight" and "Purple" somewhere toward the back of the
pack of this first batch.

     I am, and have been, *very* careful about what I say here, and to avoid
over-hyping.  You're keeping me to promises that I haven't made, or applying a
promise made about one episode to another, which is more than a little unfair.
Show me what I've said here that has been inaccurate.   Otherwise, I have
nothing to apologize for.

     And one other thing: I'm not "begging" fans to do anything.  I'm pointing
out that the next two are killer episodes, and if there's anyone somebody
knows who hasn't been wowed yet, *those* are the shows that'll do it.  That's
all.

     Dana, if you don't like it, don't watch it.  It's really that simple.
I've said before that this show will stand or fall on its own quality, not on
anything I've said here.  And I stand behind that.

                                                              jms
