     To the question about a Soul Hunter's strength...yes, it is *very*
considerable.  Even with one arm he was able to slam the hell out of the
commander, pick him up and again slam him against a wall before throwing him
about 10 feet across the room.  Had he not been stopped, and stopped good,
yes, he would've torn Sinclair to ribbons.
