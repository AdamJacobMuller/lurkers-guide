     I'd slice this a little finer and suggest that it wasn't so much the
*stupidity* of racism and the whole genetic purity aspect, but the
IMPRACTICALITY of such ideas.  If you follow the idea to its logical
conclusion, *nobody* is pure.  Which was kind of the point.

     And oddly enough, there's a pro-genocide discussion in "Deathwalker."

                                                                jms
