     BTW...someone sent me a note mentioning that somewhere or other  somebody
was citing Dukhat (S.H.) and Dabo (BTtP) as "obvious pull-overs from ST," the
first being a name in DS9, the latter being a game Quark plays.

     In reverse order...the world mentioned isn't Dabo, it's Davo; second,
Dukhat is a name that goes back as far as the original treatment, seven years.
I am consistently amazed at how everyone thinks that everything emanates from
ST.

     This show does not DO "obvious pull-overs from ST."  Period.  We don't
have to.  We're perfectly happy being our own show.  Why would ANY show,
trying to make its own identity, do this stuff?

     There are times I just despair....
