     One thing we discovered after making the pilot was that we had gotten so
dark and moody in the thing that in some cases we walked into what (as I
recall) are referred to as "illegal blacks."  Meaning it was *too* dark in
places, and some foreign distributers (which apparently is where this is a
problem) would balk at picking up the pilot.

     The other thing, BTW, is that I haven't been much aware of any *major*
lighting difference; we've upped it a bit, but not that much.  The other day I
watched (for the first time) one of our shows actually being broadcast, and
noticed that they cranked the luminescence WAY up there.   (This is a problem
rampant through TV; when I was on "Murder," we'd do these great, moody scenes,
and CBS would dial it up until it was nearly daylight.)  Some of the music was
also stomped down, cutting out most of the low frequency stuff.

                                                                 jms
