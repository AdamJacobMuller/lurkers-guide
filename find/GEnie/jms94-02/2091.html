     Re: Sinclair's actions toward the Soul Hunter...the device he uses was
trained on Delenn.  It was spiraling up to full power throughout the scene.
Just as Sinclair's thrown, you see it starting to come to critical mass...it's
shooting at Delenn.  There isn't/wasn't time to sit there and figure out how
it works, and shut off the right button.  He turned it so that it faced away
from her...and the Hunter was caught in his own machine.

     There was nowhere else to go with the machine.
