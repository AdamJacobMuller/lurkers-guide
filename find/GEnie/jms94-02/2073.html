     Well, we're doomed...I just realized today that our first *really* strong
episode, "The Parliament of Dreams," airs the same night (in most markets, the
23rd) as the Tonya Harding/Nancy Kerrigan face off in the olympics.

     Imagine a silence vast as space...that sound is neilsen ratings meters
stuck unmovingly on CBS....
