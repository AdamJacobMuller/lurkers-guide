     Negative.  The orientation of the control room is correct.  You look at
the docking bay in the direct center of the station (and the center of
rotation), which is zero-G.  Now you pan down.  You come to the observation
dome, *beneath* the docking bay.  (Incoming ships pass OVER the head of
whoever's standinga the main console.)  Their feet point down to the outer
hull of the station, and their heads point toward the docking bay.

                                                                   jms
