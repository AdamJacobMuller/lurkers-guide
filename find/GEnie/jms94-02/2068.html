     There was a fairly negligible drop in #2, from 7.0 to 6.5 rating, mainly
because the week of the second show was the beginning of sweeps period, which
is when all the networks and local stations drag out their big guns and the
competition increases *considerably*.  In addition, a show generally drops 1
or 2 ratings points after its premiere; only  one-half of one-percent is
extremely good.  Apparently, from PTEN ratings research, we're performing well
above their expectations.

     The demographics are *extremely* good...hitting exactly the audience that
advertisers want.  For a series with no franchise going in, we're still far
beyond expectations.  The overnight from L.A. -- which is all I have in hand
at the moment -- from "Purple" is a 7.4 rating with an 11 share, which is
consistent with the prior weeks, so we're holding steady.

                                                                jms
