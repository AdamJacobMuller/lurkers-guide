     Well, John, you can say it's unprofessional...but in your case, as
someone who hosts/produces a talk show on SF, you of all people should be
aware of the death of Asimov, of the place he held, of the affection many of
us held for him...and to dismiss something meant to honor that memory (and his
death is still fresh for many of us) as "cliche," frankly, as far as I'm
concerned...you should've known better.  It's got nothing to do with me, and
everything to do with knowing SF.

     And maybe next time you'll wait, and inquire, before dismissing someone
else's work as "lazy" and "unimaginative" and "cliche."  Yes, this is a place
for opinion.  And if someone's opinion is based on fuzzy thinking, rudeness,
prejudice or inaccurate information, I reserve the right to bonk that person.
Hard.  Or are you saying that you can critique my writing, but I can't
critique yours?  As I understand BBSs, it's an interactive service...one gives
as well as receives.  I am not here to be a silent punching bag.  This has
been a process of *give and take*.

     And it is as blessed to give as to receive.

     So I am twice blessed.  And so are you.

     Deal with it.

                                                                  jms
