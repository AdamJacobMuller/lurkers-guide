     Many aliens (all who require alternate atmosphere) live in the alien
sector.  Those who can breathe oxygen can live in other areas, but tend to
congregate with other non-humans in the oxygen sections of the alien sector.
The ambassadors have their own environment supported quarters in the Green
Sector, which is the high-security area for diplomats.

     Humans have the highest clearance level because this is a human run and
operated (for the most part) station.  This isn't the Federation; the Earth
Alliance would *never* allow a non-human to have highest clearance.
