     We'd gotten Patrick for Knight 2 in "Sky," based on his reaction to the
script...only to discover that he was going to be out of the country when we
were going to shoot it.  He's *very* particular about what he does, and the
scripts he does, so this was something of a compliment (and I think he
could've related to where we were going with it), but we'll just have to try
again on something else; I'd love to have him in an episode sometime.
