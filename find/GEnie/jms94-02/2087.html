     B4 never got as far as having a commander attached to it.  The last
stages of construction on Babylon 4 were supervised by one Major Krantz,
assigned specifically to that task.  He managed to get the station completed,
and on-line, and Earthforce was just beginning the process of selecting a
commanding officer to run the station when, 24 hours after the station became
operational, it vanished, taking roughly 1,200 of its skeleton crew with it
(including Major Krantz).
