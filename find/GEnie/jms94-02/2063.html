     I've only had B5 related dreams a few times...thankfully.  I need SOME
time away from it.

     Re: the statement that it took the soul hunter's ship "literally seconds"
to reach B5...nope.  Sinclair left the observation dome, went down to the
bays, got into his EVA suit, and had the ship prepped.  So it was more than 2
seconds.

                                                               jms
