     Actually, many of the alien races do *not* have monolithic religious
beliefs.  You'll note that G'Kar didn't take part in the festival from the
Narn POV.  You'll see Narn beliefs in "By Any Means Necessary," and there it's
mentioned that there are many different beliefs among Narns, G'Quon and G'Lan
being the two larger systems.
