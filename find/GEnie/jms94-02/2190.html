     You're seeing, btw, why this episode, much as it's a favorite, couldn't
be shown any sooner; there has to be some familiarity with the characters for
this to be most effective.

     As to the interpretation of the final tag scene...my thought was that
it's a way of saying, "Our dominant belief is that ALL beliefs are respcted."

                                                                  jms
