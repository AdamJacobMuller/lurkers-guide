     Well, of course, the other thing to remember about Paul is that he had a
real problem with women doing much of *anything*.  His letters about the role
of women in church came out of his concern that women were taking too big a
place in the church, and had to be pushed down.  If someone wants to yank out
a biblical quote to put women "in their place," it's almost *always* one of
Paul's.  He had a real problem with women.  (Yoko in particular.)
