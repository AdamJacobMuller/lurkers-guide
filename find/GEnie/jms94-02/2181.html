     There's a definite improvement arc in the show; the deeper we got into
production, the better the stories generally became, and the better the
production values.  (With a few exceptions.)  The biggest change in the show
came once we began writing scripts *after* we'd begun shooting episodes, so
that we/I could again see the actors and find their fingerprints.
"Parliament" is the first one I wrote after we started filming; "Soul,"
"Infection" and "Midnight" were all written prior to filming starting.

     Re: the GURU reference in this ep...could someone here, in as precise a
manner as possible, indicate the reference, what it was, wehre (where) you saw
it, and what it refers to?
