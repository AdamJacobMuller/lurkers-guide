     Regarding Ivanova...it's not really an attempt to pull at heart strings,
as it is to establish that this is someone who's had, and is still having, a
pretty rough life.  It's a real roller-coaster for her, and the way she
survives it is to absolutely bottle it up inside.  She has had angst
throughout her life, and she's in for more.

     We start to track that in little ways that probably no one will notice,
as well as making it the occasional story point.  A little way nobody'll
notice: after this episode, she starts messing with her hair, which we'd
deliberately set as extremely tight until now.  Suddenly she doesn't have
someone for whom she has to be a certain way, and she has to start finding her
*own* identity, and it ain't easy.

     Re: the club owner recognizing Sinclair (or not)...this is something we
discussed.  Can Sinclair go places in the station and not be recognized?  In
some cases, no.  In a place like the Dark Star, maybe so; this isn't the kind
of place he generally hangs out in.  It's a question of how much day-to-day
interaction somebody would have with him.  Yes, he's an important figure; but
I'm not sure if I'd immediately recognize L.A. Mayor Richard Riordan at first
glance, particularly in different style of dress, in an unusual location.
We're *not* going to do it a lot -- just once this season -- but we thought it
was a reasonable approach.

                                                                 jms
