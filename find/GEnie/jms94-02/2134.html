     Victoria...long as you're here...at this point it looks as if I won't be
able to make it to the con.  I knew there was something brewing in August, and
there are several somethings, primarily including San Diego ComicCon about a
week earlier.  When we're in the middle of production, I can get away for
*maybe* one con a month, but two is just impossible.  There's one slim chance
that I might be around there for business purposes at some point around there,
but that's still very much up in the air just now.
