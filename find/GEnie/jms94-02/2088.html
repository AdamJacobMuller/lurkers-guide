     BTW...before I forget (again), the syndicated radio show, the Mike and
John Show will be broadcast *live* from the B5 studios this Monday (tomorrow)
from 3-7 p.m. EST.  It's on WJFK in D.C., and also carried in Baltimore,
Miami, Tampa Bay, Indianapolis, Reno, Rochester, Buffalo and Fresno.  Most of
the cast will be interviewd, along with me and some of the other producer-
types.  Walter Koenig will also be on the air.

                                                               jms
