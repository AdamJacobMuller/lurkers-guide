     Well, open mouth, insert foot....as I said, it had been *tentatively*
decided to fully revise the schedule, for the reasons given.  Then someone
remembered the November sweeps.  If we do all new episodes through as
planned, we'd have *nothing* for the November sweeps, we'd be done.  So we had
to ajust a bit, so there will be 2 or 3 more after "Mind War" that're new,
culminating in "Sky," then 3-4 reruns, then picking up again.  Sweeps are
*very* important for the stations, and since the show is doing well, they
don't want to waste episodes in non-sweeps periods.

     Meanwhile...it occured to me the other day that I've finished the last
script I'm going to write for this season of B5.  Seems like we just got
started, and now I ain't got no more scripts to write for a while, until PTEN
decides whether or not to pick us up.  It's weird; kinda like coming home one
day to find your car is no longer in your garage.
