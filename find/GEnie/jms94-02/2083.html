     BTW...for those in the L.A. area...our Conceptual Consultant on B5,
Harlan Ellison, is having a special presentation, "On Being a Writer, An
Evening with Harlan Ellison."  It's being put on by the Learning Tree
University one time only on March 1st from 7-10 p.m.  He'll be talking about
writing, ethical standards, cultural illiteracy and politica (political)
correctness, among many and varied other topics.

     The price is a pittance -- $39 -- and information can be had on this by
calling 818-882-5599.
