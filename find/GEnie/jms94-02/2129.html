     I loved the lensman books, and own first editions of just about the whole
cycle.

     Re: the helmets reflecting a tactical display...we actually tried this,
and put in displays where they would actually be.  Problem is, unless you're
shooting at an up-angle, which looks really weird, it's not bright enough to
reflect much, unless you also REALLY make it bright, in which case it looks
REALLY funky.
