     Re: establishing and transitional shots...couple thoughts.  The machines
used to render establishers are the same ones used to render the show-specific
shots.  Ron's elves said, in essence, "Pick one."  So for some period of time,
we had to make do with what we had, and take care of the shots we needed for
the episodes themselves in terms of the stories.  As we went along, though, we
gradually began to add new ones.

     The other problem, of course, is that the station isn't going anywhere;
you can change the angles, but you're still stuck with planet, station, stars,
maybe a ship or two.  So even if there *were* new shots being rendered as
establishers/transitional shots for each show, there wouldn't be *that* much
difference between them.  So again, it made sense to putting those hours of
rendering time into doing bang-up shots for the main story in each episode.

     You'll get a clearer sense of some of that cool stuff in "Mind War,"
which has some strictly *gorgeous* CGI, and a LOT of it.

                                                                  jms
