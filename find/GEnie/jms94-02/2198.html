     Well, it was my thought that there will always be folks who don't want
their eyes messed with.  I still have my tonsils, and though I could afford
contacts, I won't let ANYbody touch my eyes.  There's surgery that can correct
it, but you can *really* forget that.  I dunno...it just makes sense to me
that it'll still be around.  Not everything vanishes with the passage of time.
