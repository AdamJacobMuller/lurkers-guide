     Good, one should look up words, add to one's vocabulary.  Who
does this involve?  Well, we'll see.

     Yeah, I wrote the Scripts column for Writer's Digest for almost
exactly 10 years...definitely enough for a book, but since the new 
version of my writing book is coming out in October, no point to it, really.

     Actually met Chris Roberts last year, when we were in some
preliminary discussions about us doing a Wing Commander movie or 
series.   He definitely wants to be a film-maker.
