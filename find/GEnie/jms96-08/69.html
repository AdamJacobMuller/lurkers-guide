     I have *no* idea why this should be...there's no reason why the
writers can't contact me, unless Dell is telling them not to, and if that 
is true someone at Dell is going to be tarred and feathered.  As Tim can
confirm, if someone writing the B5 DC comic had a question, they just 
sent me an email, and if I could confirm it, I would.

     Regarding Jeanne's specific story...when the spec outline came
in, I went over it with a fine-toothed comb and made notations on certain
elements to bring it into line with canon.  The script she will be 
receiving will answer about 95% of the questions in this regard.  It has 
nothing to do with kindness; when Stephen Smith needed to finish the new 
card set from Fleer, I made sure he read the final 5 scripts so he'd know 
what to include/exclude.

     With Dell, after I approve the outlines, I rarely hear from the
writers until the first draft comes in, and then I have to go over it 
with little time and try and correct it.  It'd be better if they checked 
in with me during the process but I assumed they wanted to get it out 
first, then correct what needed correcting.  If they're not being allowed 
to ask me questions, if somebody there is putting him- or herself in the 
way for reasons of controlling information or preserving authority, 
somebody's going to be in *serious* dutch.  

     I will check on this on Monday.

                                                                 jms
