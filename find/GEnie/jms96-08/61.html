       Michael is generally reserved, soft-spoken, very intelligent;
he reads quite a great deal, and has a background in NY theater, so he's 
up on all kinds of plays.  He's also very observant and a good listener.  
He tends to find the one person in the line who's been shoved back, and 
go to that person the most, or to the kid in the audience.  He has a 
somewhat philosophical bent as well.
