     It's real simple, Kwick.  I sit in a chair in the office as
actors come in to audition.  Most times, an actor comes in, and an actor 
goes out.

Sometimes, on rare occasions, the actor comes in and the character
comes in with him.  You don't see the actor, you see the character.  And 
that's the one you hire.

                                                                jms
