     Virtually all food used is real, for health reasons.  The liquid
drunk by G'Kar and Arthur in "Avalon" is Yoo-Hoo; the mountain of stuff
Garibaldi's eating in the Zocalo in first season is piled meatloaf; the 
spaghetti and bagna cauda was real; the only problem is that no matter 
what you do, it's going to get cold after 18 takes, even with reheating, 
and by the 17th take...well, it's an ugly sight.
