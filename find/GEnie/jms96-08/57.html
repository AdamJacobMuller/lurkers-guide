     Actually, the jackets you generally see me and members of the cast 
and crew wearing are *only* for those folks, who've earned them in the
trenches.  We'll never license out anything just like them, in order to 
keep them special for the crew.  We'd make a mint if we did...but that 
ain't what matters here.

     Technically, the first B5 related con I did was LosCon, where I 
screened about 15 seconds of animation for the project, and first went 
public with the name.
