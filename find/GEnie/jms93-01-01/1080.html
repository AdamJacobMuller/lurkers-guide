     Right...and there was a lengthy discussion of how the Links tie into the
B5 central computer, and how it operates in relation to those Links (which are
computer segments themselves) in either the SFX or the B5 Science topics.

     BTW, a thought, for anyone to jump in on who wants to...as noted uptopic,
on Tuesday my job is basically done.  The B5 pilot will be finished.  Between
now and the show's airing 5 or so weeks from now, what areas would you be
interested in discussing?  What things would you like to see done here?  (I
briefly considered the idea of uploading one page of the script per day
between now and the time B5 airs, but then I realized that a lot of folks
would probably prefer to see it produced, not see the script -- the ultimate
spoiler -- and thus jettisoned that idea.)  I guess my main fear is being
dull...not that that's *too* likely to happen with this crowd...but I take the
"okay, so now what?" note uptopic somewhat to heart.

     Or we can just keep doing what we're doing....

                                                                 jms
