     I use Windows a little more than I used to, but overall I suspect (well,
know, really) that I'm not getting the most bang for my buck because I don't
understand the mechanics of configuring either Windows or the computer itself.
I'm sitting here with a killer megasystem, and...the best comparison I can
think of is an australian aborigine who's found an F-16 figher plane and
mainly uses it to shelter his sheep and goats under the wings when it
rains....
