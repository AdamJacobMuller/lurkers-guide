     Yes, there's considerable training involved.  In the pilot, Lyta talks
about it in one exchange, about the "years of training" required for a P5
classification, and that most of those who try "burn out."

     As for the Fox station question...bear in mind that most stations that
broadcast Fox shows are not actively OWNED by Fox, they are only loosely
AFFILIATED with Fox.  They're still independent stations that have a deal to
buy X-number of programs from Fox Television.

                                                                  jms
