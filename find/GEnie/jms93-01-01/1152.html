     That is the only narration in the show.  When we get to the series, I
plan to adjust the narration and keep it as a stet opening.  Probably it'll be
something along the lines of, "I was there at the dawn of the Third Age of
Mankind.  It began in the Earth year 2257.  Babylon 5 was the last of the
Babylon stations.  This is its story...."
