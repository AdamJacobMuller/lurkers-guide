     I'm finishing B5 post production this coming week, and writing my third
novel, and am helping out a friend on another series (said friend having
gotten in over his head a bit, through no fault of his own) doing rewrites and
a few scripts.  Just something to keep me busy while waiting to gear up for
the series.  (Also took time to write out a synopsis of each of the first 22
episodes for B5's first season, which will then be assigned as needed,
interposing new ideas as they're suggested by other writers.  Also finished an
hour-length B5 script, which will be one of the mid-season shows to be shot.)
