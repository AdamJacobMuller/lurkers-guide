     Leviathan...as a local, mayhap you could ring up Dana Hersey and fill him
in on the background, just so's he knows it ain't a DS9 riff.

     This is probably the single biggest problem I know we're gonna have with
reviews.  On every other level, we'll stand on our own; I just don't want that
inaccuracy surfacing and skewing the review.

                                                               jms
