     There's something about the Lyta/Garibaldi dynamic that I like, as others
here have noted as well.  I keep playing with one scene I'm dying to write,
where he's trying to pick up on her, and says, "Listen, what do you say we go
by my quarters, I'd like to show you my favorite thing in the whole world."
She gives him THAT look.  "Okay-okay-okay, my SECOND favorite thing in the
whole world."
