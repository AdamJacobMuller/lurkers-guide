     Someone back a while ago suggested "Fivers," and that's kinda nice.

     Re: Captain Power...yeah, that's a show that is an example of what to
strive for, and how sometimes good intentions can get derailed.  We genuinely
wanted to come up with a long-term story, and by and large, we succeeded.  The
problem was the marketing in front of the show, and the merchandising behind
the show...we got killed from both sides.

     There's an entire second season of unproduced CP scripts, story edited by
Larry DiTillio, in which he follows up on the arc that I and others
established during the first season.  You would have found out what Dread
became, what happened to Power's mother, where Eden was (and there would be
direct contact), what the secret was in Soaron's programming, and so on.

     It was a good experience, though, and it let me cut my teeth on multi-
season story construction.  It was the experience on Power that led me to
believe that something like B5 could be done.  (And yeah, I still have much
the same reaction to the last episode...it's a real tough one to watch...which
was the point.)

                                                                    jms
