     Re: sign off tags...pruff...that stuff's for sissies.  The jms is
sufficient for my needs (and looks kinda like a revolver pointed right).

     Have seen the whole movie now with final EFX, sound, music, dialogue, all
that jazz.  Looks better than I'd hoped possible.  Will be cleaning up a few
spots in the next two days, and then watching the final product one more time,
this time on a regular TV set rather than the studio's projection system and
sound system, to better gauge what will and won't be audible on a home TV.

     By mid-day Wednesday, we be done.

                                                                   jms
