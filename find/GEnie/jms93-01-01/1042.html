     Ah, except, Gary, for the reason I picked that particular metaphor; this
ain't Sudden Death, as with football.

     This one's going to the judges at the end of the round, and the case will
be decided...win, lose or draw...on the merits of the performance in the ring,
not on hype (on either side), not on good feelings, but on the quality of the
work, which is as it should be.  Only thing I've ever asked at any point in my
life is a fair fight on a level playing field.  Then let things fall as they
may.

     And as for the judges...look in the mirror.

                                                                   jms
