     I can more or less hold my own in math UNTIL such time as suddenly we're
dealing with numbers AND letters.  For some reason, I'm absolutely hard-wired
for language.  Letters are part of a word, a number is for math.  When someone
says "A = 9" my immediate response is, "A what?  *A* dog?  *A* horse?  What?"
I know what the theory is on all this, that there are groups, sub-groups,
universes, all that jazz...the theory is fine...but when I look at a number
AND a letter in an equation, my brain goes into vapor lock, I get confused and
fall down.

     I don't even want to TALK about the scams I ran in order to pass my
semester of Statistical Psychology to get my B.A. in clinical psych.
