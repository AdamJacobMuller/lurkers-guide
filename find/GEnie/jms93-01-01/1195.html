     I'm still hammering down the rules on hyperspace...what can and can't be
done.  My first thought was that they travel blind, but given that it's
heavily traveled, I realized after a while that you'd *have* to be able to see
your surroundings in order to avoid collisions.

     The point you raise is quite conceivable.

                                                               jms
