     Yes, a VERY large blunt object.

     The one point of any possible interest to draw from this comes from
something I tried to beat into incoming students when I was an orientation
counselor at SDSU: if you go to college, and all you see are the class rooms,
the bathrooms, the parking lot and the cafeteria, you will cheat yourself of
99% of your possible education.  Any university or college has vast
opportunities for writers and others.  In the former case, write for the
university newspaper, or the university theater (and most schools have an
ongoing one-act production program)...take classes in acting or film, to get a
sense of history, or the hands-on process of being on stage...the range of
experience open to you is enormous.  Don't just follow your major to its
conclusion.  There is a world of experience you can get while you're there
*that you may never have the chance to experience again*.   Take it.

     End of sermon.  I shouldn't even be here, frankly, this is for the new
folks and others to sign in and introduce themselves...both for the interests
of our own private party, so we know who's come into the room, and for any
possible future mailings or opportunities.

     Let's hear from y'all.

                                                                 jms
