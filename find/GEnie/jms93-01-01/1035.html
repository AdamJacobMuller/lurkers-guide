     What an amazing group of posts...I'm speechless.  It's gratifying to see
that the process works, that this medium can be used to such good effect.
Something that has always been important to me is de-mystifying the process.
Lee mentioned somewhere uptopic that the on-line stuff has been going on for a
long time, across various shows, from RGBs and Power through Zone and now to
this.  To de-mystify writing, Harlan writes in bookstore windows...I do this.

     I just got a private note today (oh, and speaking of notes, just address
hard-copy mail to my name; it's a private mailing address, not a studio) from
one fellow who just managed to get a development deal with a studio.  It ain't
big, but it's a start...and because of the discussion here, and elsewhere over
the years, he has a better idea of what to expect, and how to prepare.

     This is an extremely tough business to crack.  And the largest part of
the problem is just getting accurate information.  When I came to LA
originally, I didn't know squat, and a long time -- a LONG time -- was wasted,
time I now very much regret losing, because I just didn't fully  or accurately
understand How Things Worked.  If this process can make the entry easier for
another writer, or de-mystify what happens behind the screen, then all the
better.

     And, selfishly, it has been great to get the input, to hear the
questions, especially those I can't answer...because down the road you just
KNOW that that question will come up eventually, and better to be hit with it
now than blindsided later on.  It's a rewarding, fascinating and challenging
exchange.  I suspect that a LOT of shows would be considerably improved for
this kind of direct communication.

     Oh, yeah...and re the newsletter...if you ask Christy nice, I'm sure
she'll send you the back issue.  Tell her I said it was okay.

                                                                  jms
