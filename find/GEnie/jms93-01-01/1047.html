     I have no problem with married couples, none whatsoever, serving the EA.
And, as I've said before, there is no problem having a kid in the background,
as one of a family passing through, for instance, but I do not wish to center
a whole *story* around one.  Someone said "But they can do it on TNG and DS9,"
which is one more reason for NOT doing it here, to keep the identities
separate and distinct.

                                                                 jms
