     You can jump into the B5 story at *any* point...only thing is, the more
you watch, the more you get the nuances.  PICKET FENCES is a great example of
this.

     And if the waiting to hear when and under what umbrella B5 will be picked
up is killing YOU....

                                                                   jms

     (Umbrella = same night/second night, not to start any rumors.)
