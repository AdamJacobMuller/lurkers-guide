     Yeah, I'm *pretty much* staying to Naval terms, mainly because the
introduction of starships will probably be under that heading as vessels, and
that seems to follow.  Additionally, if all of the various major militaries of
various countries were combined into one Earthforce, then there would be some
standardization, and naval terms *seem* to be more standard than others across
services, but my research there isn't as deep as it probably should be.  Would
be nice to work in some variations, however....
