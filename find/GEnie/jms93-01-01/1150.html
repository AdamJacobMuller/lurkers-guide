     Re: the voices....I can't do it, I can't tell him....

     Re: the narration at the beginning...actually, I suppose there's no
reason why I can't put it up here.

     LONDO (older voice): "I was there at the dawn of the Third Age of
Mankind.  It was the Earth year 2257.  Babylon 5 was the last of the  Babylon
stations, located deep in neutral space.  It was a port of call for
businessmen, smugglers, diplomats, businessmen and travelers from a hundred
worlds.  It could be a dangerous place, but we accepted the risk because
Babylon 5 was our last, best hope for peace.  Under the leadership of its
final commander, Babylon 5 was a dream given form...a dream of a galaxy
without war, where species from other worlds could exist in mutual respect...a
dream that was endange one man on a mission of destruction.  Babylon 5 was the
last of the Babylon stations.  This...is its story."

     That's from memory, and as I look at it, some of it ain't *exactly* right
(that should be "species from different worlds" not "other worlds," for
instance, but the sense of it is correct, and it's probably 90% textually
correct.  (I also see I repeated businessmen twice...which means I left
something out, but having now been up about 20 hours, I'm too tired to
remember what or to look it up in the script.)

     I'll try to remember to dig out the exact wording and put it up, if
anyone's interested.

                                                                jms
