     WHO TOLD YOU ABOUT PLANET GAWOOMPKI?!  EGADS!  THERE'S A LEAK IN OUR
OPERATION!

     (Actually, there *is* a leak in our organization...the funny thing is
that it's me.)

     Re: Sinclair and Ambassador-ship...there's a very logical questoin (or
question) that has to be dealt with.  (Again, we go back to that same point,
asking the next question.)  Why is a *Commander* serving on the station, and
the Advisory Council, and representing Earth?  Wouldn't they have a regular
Ambassador present?

     This is a question that we will resolve.  As well as the one implicit in
the foregoing: why is a *COMMANDER* -- lower in rank than a Captain --
entrusted with this responsibility, rather than an Admiral or some other high-
ranking individual?

                                                                       jms
