     Yes, it's repetitive.  Yes, it's deliberate.  It brings you back to the
beginning of the narrative, which is a space shot that more or less matches
the other shot.  (Makes a visual loop, in other words.)

     Telestro: certainly one of our characters might go the way of
Saruman....and one might go the way of Aragorn...and Gandalf...ah, well,
that's always uncertain, isn't it?  "Expect me when you see me."
