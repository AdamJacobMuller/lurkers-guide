     Ah, but remember, the government is the one who put the jump
gate in; no
one individual or corp could afford to do that.  When your ship, if
Earth
registered, comes through, you're automatically billed, just like
income
tax...it goes against your credit.  If you're not Earth registered,
you pay
when you arrive at an Earth port or orbital transfer station. 
Either way, you
pay.  If you try to land somewhere without proper authorization,
you'll be
arrested and your ship confiscated.

     Now, you could probably come through the gate, hang in space
for a while,
and go back in again (IF you're a non-Earth registered ship) and
not pay
anything...but in that case, what's the point?  It'd be like taking
a
difficult trip in a small ship across the Atlantic, and not getting
out or
going ashore once you arrive.
