     And the program should be pretty nifty, from what I'm
heaing....

     Just uploaded another gif, the last for a little bit; 774,
named
cockpit.gif.  It's a composite shot of the interior of a Starfury
that's being
fired upon, the incoming blast whiting (or in this case greening)
out the
cockpit.  Is this shot from "Sky?"  Could be.

     It's a bit hard to look at because of the lighting, but it'll
give you
some idea of the interior of these things.

     BTW, tomorrow we do the final mix on "Sky."  And for that
episode,
Christopher Franke has composed a piece entitled "Requiem For the
Line," which
is very moving...at the same time brave and sad, hopeful and
ominous, martial
and doomed...one of the best things I've heard for TV.

     The other day, a reporter asked me what I wanted to accomplish
with
B5...and I remembered this commercial showing a viewer plastered
against the
wall opposite the TV...and that seemed about right.  I don't want
viewers to
see a show and say, afterward, "Well, that was a nice story."  
There has to
be more than that.

     And while we certainly have our episodes that are paced just
a little
more slowly, less intensely, because you have to have variation,
have to allow
time for character stories...there are some episodes, like "Sky,"
that just
hit the viewer right between the eyes with a 2 by 4 *real* hard and
say "HEY!
PAY ATTENTION!  WE'RE NOT KIDDING HERE!"

     Take no prisoners....
