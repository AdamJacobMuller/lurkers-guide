     Kathryn's last name is Drennan.  Her full credit is Kathryn M.
Drennan.
Not Straczynski.  Probably displaying considerable wisdom on her
part.  Ten
thousand letters, no vowels.

     Absent a collaboration on a series of articles for TZ Magazine
a few
years ago (a guide to the Night Gallery series), we don't
collaborate.   Ever.
I also don't collaborate with Larry D., or any other of my writer
friends.  As
I learned before, particularly on the one occasion when Larry and
I tried it --
we co-wrote a pilot and bible for CBS based on the "Elfquest" books
-- all
parties concerned will live a LOT longer by keeping a respectable
distance.
