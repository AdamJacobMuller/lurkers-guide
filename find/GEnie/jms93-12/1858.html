     For no discernible reason, except perhaps that I am a glutton
for
punishment, I have uploaded a file I don't think was previously in
the B5
library: jms.gif.  I stumbled across this on another system. 
Insofar as I can
tell, it's a scan of the B&amp;W photo that appears on the back cover
of my second
novel, "Othersyde."
