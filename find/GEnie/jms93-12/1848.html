     For starters, the Orion constellation would not look like the
Orion
constellation from another POV, say, 30 light years from here. 
Another
cluster of stars might *look* the same, or similar, but anyone
expecting to
see the constellations as we recognize them from here is going to
be
disappointed.

     As far as I know, from what Ron's said re: constellations,
while it may
look like Orion, it isn't.  It's perception, the mind looking for
patterns it
recognizes.
