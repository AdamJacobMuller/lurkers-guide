     Although in the new laserdisk set of SW movies, the matting is
FAR less
noticeable.

     Re: the crew...today was Pajama Day.  Don't ask.

     Some thoughts on the crew, btw...which besides being
sensational on its
own terms, is a very caring bunch of guys.  Some of them have been
making
expeditions to the post office lately, gathering Santa letters and
circulating
them to grant wishes for toys.  There's a wall of letters that have
been
answered so far with presents.  Just one example; there are more. 
They're
good people.
