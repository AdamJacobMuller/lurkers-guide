     I doubt there would be much problem at all in translating it
to the other
platform.

     Arne: slight correction to your correction.  No scene with
Chan or
Eastman was "removed," it's simply an incorrect listing.  Chan and
Eastman are
both in "The War Prayer," they were never in "Infection" in any
way, manner,
shape or form.  It was simply a typo on the part of the person who
wrote up
the lists, putting names from one show into the wrong sheet.
