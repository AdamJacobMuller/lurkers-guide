     I think the material will be repeated, but I'm not 100% sure. 
I know
there will be two 30 second spots, two 15 second spots, and three
10 second
spots, so I doubt they'd need 45 minutes total to do all of that.
 But don't take my word for it.

     BTW, the interactive B5 computer program should be available
online by
around January 10th.
