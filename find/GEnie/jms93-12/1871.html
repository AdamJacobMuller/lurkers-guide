     Season one will generally answer 90% of the questions raised
in season
one; season two will answer the remaining 10%, and answer 90% of
the questions
raised in season two...and so on.  There will not be a sense of
unfulfilled
waiting.  Also, by January I will personally fly under my own power
from New
York to Paris.

     I reallly, *really* need a vacation....
