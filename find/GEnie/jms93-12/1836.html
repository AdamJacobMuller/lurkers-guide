     The one thing that I'd like to point out is that Warner/PTEN
isn't in the
programming business.  This isn't a normal part of their PR
strategy.  The
only reason they have done this at all -- the B5 computer promo --
is in
recognition of the online support here and elsewhere.  They have
had to
contract out for this, and because this isn't a proven (yet)
strategy, could
only carve out so much for it.  No, not every platform is covered;
doubtless
that will change with time.  But it's generally never done at ALL. 
So I would
just temper the discussion with that reality.
