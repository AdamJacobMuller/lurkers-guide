     When we did the research on how a fighter could best operate
in zero
gravity, it seemed to require a four-wing axis with thrusters on
every side.
We've thus taken every possible step to make them NOT look like
x-wings,
particularly since there's no long, sleek forward section at *all*,
it's a
snub-nose, and the wings don't move, plus they have the unusual
thruster
combination.

     "Trax" is/or was still running new eps as of a few weeks ago. 
The
schedule was deliberate, to make what they had stretch.  That may
change this
season; we'll have to see.  Haven't heard yet re: the final
schedule.  For our
part, we have 6 finished (completely done, music, sound, all that)
episodes in
hand now, and will have one more by the christmas break.  By the
time we go on
the air, we'll have a total of 12-14 in hand, so we're in great
shape in terms
of scheduling stuff.
