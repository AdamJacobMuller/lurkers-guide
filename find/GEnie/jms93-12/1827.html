     Don't show 'em the pilot first.  Let 'em dive right in.

     Yeah, we do a LOT of ships this season.  I have gifs of them
all, and
some of them are mind-bogglingly nifty.  What I like about Ron's
work is that
many of the space shots are works of art you could practically
frame.  And
he's done one very important thing: he's brought COLOR into space,
in a big
way.  Ships are personalized, painted, textured and made into
things you enjoy
looking at.  The Starfury nicknamed the Sea Witch is a great
example of
this...as well as a bunch of others.

     Not all Starfuries are the same, btw...you'll be seeing a
different
category of them in "Mind War," and they're gorgeous.  Also very
scary.   Not
as scary, but more nifty, are the ones in "Survivors" and
"Chrysalis."

     Ah LOVES spaceships....
