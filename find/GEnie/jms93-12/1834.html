     Er, Arne, just checked the revised "Infection" description in
19...
neither Kiron nor Roberts appear in that episode.  They're in "The
War
Prayer."

     I got the erroneous file listings today, and have advised PTEN
of the
mistakes, and they're being corrected.

                                                              jms
