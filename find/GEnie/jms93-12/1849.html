     Mike: you needn't worry.  I find all-powerful beings of any
stripe
incredibly boring.  I find it more interesting when ordinary people
are
summoned to do extraordinary things, and must rise above their
limitations
without losing their limitations; succeeding in spite of them. 
Sinclair is a
man, period.  He may have a great calling ahead of him, as did
Churchill or
Lincoln or Alexander or (for all we know) Rondo Hatton, but they're
all just
men in the final analysis.
