     Happily, the energy level here isn't flagging at all; if
anything,
there's been an infusion of energy, partially through being able to
show some
of our crew finishd episodes, so they can see the whole elephant
rather than
only isolated parts (to great reaction), and partly through the
reactions at
the con.  We're all feeling very renewed and rededicated toward the
show.
