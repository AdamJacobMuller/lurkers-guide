     Here's a thought to conjure with.  It takes about an hour to
render a CGI
frame that's very complex; 45 minutes if it's not terribly complex.
 With the new Screamer, we can cut down that time by about half, so
that a
highly complex scene can be rendered in 15-30 minutes.  Average
length for a
CGI scene is about 60 frames, so figure 30 hours.  You can do a
full show's
worth of CGI in about a week, give or take.

     Today we turn over the raw footage for a special scene that'll
be in one
of our episodes.  (Several scenes, actually, in the same episode.) 
 Ron's
elves will be rendering 24 hours a day (on automatic at night) for
the next
THREE WEEKS to do something very special with this episode.  If
it's done
right, it won't really draw attention to itself, it'll just be
very, very
cool.
