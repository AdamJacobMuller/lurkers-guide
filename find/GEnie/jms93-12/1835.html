     Here's the interesting thing...ever since July, when we began
shooting,
we've been sitting here, doing our show quietly...and now, as
January nears,
slowly we've been growing aware of a sound...the PTEN and Warners
]MACHINE[
gearing up.  Press, promotion, photographers on the set, calls with
International and books divisions, and now the sound is quite
pervasive, like
a jet engine gearing up for flight.  Suddenly it comes clear, "Oh,
yeah, we're
not just making our little show here for ourselves, this is bigger
than just
us."  The energy level is definitely powering up around here.

     Had a reporter in here the other day, and he asked if it
bothered me that
other shows were getting all the ink...meaning, I suppose, TNG and
DS9 and
SQ:DSV...and my response really said it all, I think.  It's like
the Rocky
movie.  Let the other guys get all the press, do the big flashy
stuff, wave
around big budgets...we'll just stand here in a meat locker,
pounding slabs of
meat with our bare hands....
