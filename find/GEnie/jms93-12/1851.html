     Catherine Sakai is all business.  Not much for display.

     It's "J. Michael Straczynski" on title credits mainly because
that's the
way it looks best, frankly.  Lets you sneak up on the whole name in
progressively larger bites.  Joe Michael Straczynski looks kinda
dumb to me,
also too long; Joe Straczynski is too short, and unbalanced in
terms of layout
(he said quickly).  My friends call me Joe.  My crew calls me Joe. 
One person
on the crew kept calling me Mr. Straczynski, which you should try
saying out
loud sometime.  Even *I* can't do it.  It was so painful to listen
to that
after a while I kept calling back "Joe" at him until he got the
message.
