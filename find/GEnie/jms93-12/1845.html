     We're still working out book details.  One possibility is also
to take
the most heavily arc-related episodes, stitch them together into a
novelized
form, and publish them so that there in one book is the major part
of that
year's arc.  Other approaches are still being investigated.

     And yes, in TV, it's the exec producer who generally gets the
final cut,
whereas in film it's often the director (or, in some cases, the
studio).
