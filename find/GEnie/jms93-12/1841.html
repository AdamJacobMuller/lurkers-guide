     Oh, I know...I saw the (g) the first time...I just kneejerk
respond
sometimes, take things seriously just in case the g didn't mean
what it seemed
to mean (and nothing is what it appears yes?).

     Re: the Oliver Stone thing...that's a comment made during the
edit on
"Chrysalis" as well.  I'm dying to see how people will react to
what's done
and revealed and advanced in that episode, but we have to sit on
it; though
we'll be mixing and finishing it in the next few weeks, we won't be
turning it
over to PTEN until shortly before airdate, because we don't want
this getting
all over town.  There's not a single major character who's not
profoundly
affected...or strongly set up for profound changes in the very near
future.

     I love it...it's my favorite of the season, without question.
