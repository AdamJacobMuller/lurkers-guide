     Will try the black magnetite tapes.  (Is that like red
kryptonite?)   I
almost exclusively use TDK hi-fi or SVHS otherwise.

     Work on the documentary should be finished sometime early next
week, and
transmitted to the stations sometime thereafter, by about a week or
so.
Walter seems fine.

     Me...I'm glad it's the production break.  I need to sleep in
a bit, and
catch up with some work, and find the floor of my home office
again, which is
currently covered by scripts, comics, and reams of paper.  I've
worked on
shows before, but never in this major a capacity, running the
damned thing,
especially the way this has to be run...meaning you can't let any
details slip
past, no matter how small...and frankly, as Arnold said in T2, "I
need a
vacation."  When we hit the Thanksgiving break, I crashed one night
and didn't
even see the next day, slept right through until that night. 
There's nothing
that can really prepare you for a job like this.

     Re: moving "Mind War" up...no, doesn't affect continuity at
all.  If it
did, it wouldn't have gotten moved.  It's what's called in the biz
a "moveable
piece," able to go *almost* anywhere in the schedule, as long as
it's after
episode 3 and before episode 15, since stuff in the first few set
it up, and
15 pays off part of it.

                                                               jms
