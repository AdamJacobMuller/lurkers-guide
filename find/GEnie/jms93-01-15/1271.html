      EEEEEEEEEKKK!!!!!

      I just read the first eight messages in the new topic 19 (mine).   Jeez,
what a flashback.  What redundencies.  Did I really sound that gleepy?  Oh,
man.  It's like looking at your high school yearbook photo.   Are you guys
*really* sure you want to do this?

      Eek, I tell you, Eek!

                                                                 jms
