     "Bob" will never be seen talking anywhere, at any time, for any reason,
in B5.  I'll personally run a truck over him first, newscast or not (unless I
think I can get a good gag out of it...).

     Re: my mental state...I'll know better in a week or so.  I try not to get
too personally involved with my own life.  Basically, it's lots of fatigue.
During the five days of editing, there was so much going on (the
music/sound/dialogue edit), I was so obsessed with making sure it all fit
together, that for two nights out of that I got no sleep at all, not so much
as a minute...I'd crash, and just stare at the ceiling, brain chasing itself
in ever-smaller circles, until gradually light started to come in through the
window slats.  (Did you know that Danger Mouse is on at 6:30 a.m. out here?
I'd wondered where that show had gone.)  This happened two nights in a row, so
by the end of the fourth day, without really any sleep at all, I had elevated
to a whole new plane of consciousness.  The day after we finished, I slept for
something like 18 hours straight.

     I tend to live crisis to crisis, and I guess right now my mental state is
mainly one of concern for how the show does when it airs.  First was the
concern about getting the show made; then the concern about getting the show
made RIGHT; then the conern about post-production; then the concern
about...well, you get the idea.

     There's this great character in Eric Frank Russell's "Men, Martians and
Machines" about a photographer who, on return starflights from the ship's
exploratory missions, sits and does nothing but worry about his pictures
coming back intact.  The one time he DIDN'T worry, they were destroyed.  So
now that's what he does: sits, stares, and worries.  That's about how I get
through on shows like this.

     BTW, for those interested, the magazine Aboriginal SF has an article by
Susan Ellison about B5, including an extensive commentary from Harlan about
his involvement with the show.  (The issue just hit the stands.)

                                                                   jms
