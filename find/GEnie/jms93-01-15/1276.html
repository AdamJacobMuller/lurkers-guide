     While we may indeed have a CGI character down the road, it most assuredly
*won't* be a shapechanger.  I don't like to swim in somebody else's pond.

     Re: observatories...we'll be introducing the many other specialists who
work at B5 as we go along, from environmental techs to astrophysicists, so
we'll definitely find a place for this.
