     Nope, the music is all original to our composer, Stewart Copeland.

     And it be WAY cool.

     (On the B5 blooper reel, there's a shot of all these alien faces, and
that rock song with the lyric, "Everyone's strange, when you're a stranger,
faces look strange, when you're alone" going on in BG.  Very funny.)

                                                                 jms
