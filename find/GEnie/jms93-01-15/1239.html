     Correct, that's the shot seen in the magazine.

     Re: the B5 commercials...please drop me a line reminding me of this prior
to con-dor, or I'll forget.  (Jeez, between the commercials and the cut
scenes, this is starting to add up to some considerable viewing time.)

     Coke, Pepsi, who cares as long as it's got caffeine?

     Katherine: I made a discovery, a better deli than Jerry's or Arts:
Solley's, on Van Nuys two blocks up from Ventura, in the same complex as the
multicinema.  A good deli, and a great restaurant, with stuff I haven't seen
elsewhere.  (Corned beef and fried egg sandwich...might as well inject the
cholesterol right into your veins and get it over with.)

                                                                jms
