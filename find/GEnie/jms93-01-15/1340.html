     Shane...imagine, if you will, a slow fuse being lit...as I stare at the
name, thinking, "There was something...something I was supposed to do,
something...writing?"  Then, finally, the fuse works its way through the dense
foliage I laughingly call my cerebral cortex and explodes with the words "THE
ARTICLE, STUPID!  YOU NEVER FINISHED PROOFREADING THE ARTICLE HE SENT YOU!"

     A thousand apologies, Shane.  The piece came in right when I was in the
midst of finishing B5 and leaving M,SW, my life was degenerating into stark,
staring madness, and I put it down, intent upon taking care of it that
evening, and next thing I know...I see your message here.

     Hope I didn't screw anything up....

                                                                   jms
