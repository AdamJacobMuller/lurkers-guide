     So, Denny, any comments of David's that you'd like to repeat here, or
provide for PR use?  If not, that's okay.

     Yeah, I'm inclined to think that there will be an upswing in interest.
 What intrigues me is the notion that we actually will have two audiences out
there: those who've followed this discussion, and will be able to read into
things the various background information posted here...and those who will see
it totally absent any background on the characters or the universe.  An
offhand comment in the pilot would have more meaning for those who've been
following this, and can fill in the blanks.

     As a writer, though, you can't expect anyone to bring prior knowledge of
your story TO the story, it has to be self-sufficient, so we'll see how well
it functions on that level when the new folks arrive.

     I'm sorry if it seems like there's an awful lot of self-examination going
on here...my tendency is toward being hyper-critical of the work, rather than
to try and make excuses for it.  And again, I must selfishly admit that I
learn a *lot* from these exchanges, and the diversity of opinions here, and
the depth of the answers to questions asked, is quite striking and most
invaluable.

                                                                   jms
