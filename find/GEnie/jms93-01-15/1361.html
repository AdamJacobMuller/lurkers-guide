     The death penalty question is one I've been debating in terms of B5 for
quite some time.  Look at the math involved...if you find someone guilty of
murder, do you spend all the money and time and effort and so on to ship them
to a penal colony?  The cost would be ENORMOUS.  Do you keep them imprisoned
on B5?  If so, eventually you'll run out of room.  So the question becomes, Do
you space them?  Kill them humanely?

     There's a B5 story I have in mind that will explore this question, but
I'm not yet sure which way I want to go on it.

     And to the question above...some stations air PTEN shows on different
nights, yes, there's some flexibility.

                                                                  jms
