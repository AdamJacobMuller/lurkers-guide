     BTW, I've been hearing more and more from our Warners liaison that the
reviewers who've gotten copies of the B5 pilot have had their corneas melted
by what they've seen.  Half a dozen have already scrapped plans for other
covers in their weekly television magazine/supplements in deference to a cover
story on B5 (and this during Sweeps Week, no less!).

     Keep your eyes peeled, folkses...the stuff should start hitting the
streets in the final week of our countdown.

                                                                jms
