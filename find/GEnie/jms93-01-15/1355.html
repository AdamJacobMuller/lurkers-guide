     Jack's message is correct.  The only "sale" aspect was that the GEIs in
question had to send $1 to help cover postage; the shirt was free.  (I hear a
few have shown up at auctions for sale; $50 for one, in fact.)

     And yes, the triangle logo has been pretty much officially dropped.
Whether or not we'll find another use for it down the road is an open
question, but for now...yep.

                                                                jms
