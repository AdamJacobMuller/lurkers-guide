     Artisan: I think j.roy's got some graphics that qualify; nudge him into e-
mailing them.

     Nothing to pick at?  Oh, dear.  Stand with your face half an inch from
the mirror, and tell me you see no imperfections.  We all see the things
others miss.  Tell you what...at some point after the pilot's aired, after
things have settled down, I'll go through my list of things to do better in
the series, things we should've done different in the pilot, on and on.  But
that's the *purpose* of a pilot, to try a show out for size, see how it fits,
and make adjustments.

     But no matter how good it gets, everything is open for improvement in
some way.  You have to keep constantly questioning and re-evaluating.   The
unexamined life and all that jazz.

                                                                   jms
