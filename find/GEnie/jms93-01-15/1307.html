     If the Garibaldi outfit you refer to is on page 30, that's the same cut
of uniform as Sinclair's on 34, just a different angle on it.  (And there's no
white shirt under the outfits on page 28; those are high  collars with gold
braid.)  Now, there *is* another outfit that both he and Sinclair wear, it's a
black outfit (pants and long shirt) under a grey flak-jacket, which is a
combat uniform.  (The flak jackets are composed of various reflective
substances that help refract and dissipate some of the impact of energy
weapons.)
