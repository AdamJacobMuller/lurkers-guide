     Ah, but you see, for starters, the issue may not be one of reform; okay,
A kills B, so we transform A into a better person...this by you is a
punishment?  What is the purpose of the law, to reform or to avenge?

     Plus you run into the other problem...what of the other species out there
who may require death for certain offenses, such as murder of their own
species?

     And consider this: A kills B.  B happens to be your little sister, age
12.  A gets transformed by the psychs.  And you're now living side by side
with A, you see him every day, in a closed station...would thisn ot lead to
MORE murders?

                                                                   jms
