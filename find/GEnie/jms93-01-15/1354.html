     I'll know more about the computer game next week or so.  Best thing in
general is to write to Licensing Corporation of America to get on their
mailing list for future B5 promotional stuff and merchandising.

     The Creation designs for shirts look okay, if a tad prosaic...there has
got to be one central image to promote this show, but I'm darned if I can
figure out what it is at this stage.  The logo looks swell, though, in any
event.

                                                                 jms
