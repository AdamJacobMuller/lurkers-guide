     BTW, I'm giving some thought, since I'm going to be appearing at Con-Dor
in San Diego this March as GoH, to bringing along some of the scenes we ended
up cutting from the pilot, just to see folks' reaction to the stuff.  (Filmed
and cut, not cut before filming.  There are about half a dozen extensive
scenes available.)

                                                                  jms
