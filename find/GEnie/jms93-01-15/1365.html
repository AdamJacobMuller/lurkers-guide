     I think that, to avoid a western-centered show, you have to work from the
assumption that the EA has incorporated laws other than those of the good old
US of A.  Which will add some color to things.

     As for how dangerous a place B5 is...the comment about the prior Babylon
stations is a good and telling one.  There are almost two levels of
understanding on this...the sense of those who work there and maintain the
environment, who know just how fragile this situation really is, and the sense
of those who come and go, whose sense of safety has to be reinforced if B5 is
to be commercially viable.  Which opens up some interesting moral and ethical
dilemmas for some of the crew....

                                                                  jms
