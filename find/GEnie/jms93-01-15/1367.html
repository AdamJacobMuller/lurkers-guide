      Jim...hmm...interesting...an inquisitorial system could make for a good
adjunct to something I'd been thinking of...something Harlan suggested,
actually, during our first B5 brainstorm session last year.

      Which I'll elaborate on at some point in the future, but in the
interim...good idea.

                                                                jms
