     Rob: so what would you suggest?

     If B5 succeeds, there will be comics published in the same basic
universe, as well as novelizations.  These will be specifically encouraged to
go in different directions, partly for selfish reasons, so they won't mess
with my time/character line, and partly because I'd like to see what others
can do with this universe...sort of like a shared world anthology.  So yes,
there's room to play, and with luck, we'll see it there and elsewhere.

     What other options would you suggest?  If I've missed something, let me
know.

                                                                 jms
