     Brad: in Washington DC, B5 will be on WDCA-TV.

     And yes, pre-production has begun on "The Gathering."  Production and
prostethics designs have started, most of the high-tech equipment we'll need
for computer design has been ordered and should be arriving this week, a
director has been selected (though he's not yet locked down contractually, so
I can't announce who at this time), some production assistants have been
hired, others have been put on line...so the actual, physical process has
indeed begun.

                                                               jms
