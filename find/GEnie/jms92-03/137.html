     Actually, on the M,SW subject, I checked with some computer folks, and
the scenario as presented would work.  1) A number of people do leave their
computers on 24 hours a day, partly because the biggest problem with computers
is blowing a power source due to lots of turning on/off, and partly because
more and more computers are coming with internal fax cards, and thus they're
leaving them on to catch late-night or early morning faxes.  I imagine that
Jessica Fletcher would go for about the same modem setup I just bought, a
14,400 v32 bis that could exchange a LOT of information quickly.  In addition,
if the program slipped into her computer operates like my Windows or Norton
backup, it can be set to send out ONLY the newly-created or edited files...so
the whole process could take place in about 5-10 minutes.

     So NYAH!

     As for B5 casting...we'll be starting that in a few weeks, probably
around the 3rd week of April or 1st week of May, depending.  So figure on some
sort of announcement here around middle or late May.

                                                                jms
