     All I can say at this point is that something will be done.  In the
interim, anyone who wants to drop Paramount a letter is welcome to do so.

     I think the reason that we're in this situation, as opposed, say, to a
novel, is that we're in the same media.  When it comes to TV, the Paramount
attitude seems to be, "But...WE own space!"

     Hang fire, folks.  And get the word out.
