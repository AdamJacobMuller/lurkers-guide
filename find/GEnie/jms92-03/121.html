     Yeah...it was a decent show, all things considered.  (Just curious, how
many tapes did you find?  To the best of my knowledge, only six were
commercially released...about 1/3rd or 1/2 of the total of 24 episodes.)

     As for a being that is an actual *shapechanger*...screw it, let the Other
Guys have him/it.  Who says I'm not reasonable?

                                                                  jms
