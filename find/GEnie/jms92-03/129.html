     Not officially, Jay.  Not yet.  I'll announce as soon as I can, which
can't be until after papers are signed.

     Lawrence: yes, it *is* a substantial burden.  Which is why there will be
a slight shift in responsibilities once the series gets going.  The screenplay
has a line from Sinclair indicating that there *was* an Earth ambassador on
the station, but the ambassador fell ill and had to return home, during which
time Sinclair is nominally filling that role.

     So now he's wearing two hats, as it were, and Laurel is wearing one.
When the series gets going, he will be wearing one hat, and she will be
wearing one hat...and a lot of SF fans are going to get something they've been
asking for for a long, long, long time.

     At least, I *think* that's what I'm going to do...though I'm still
working out some of the permutations...it's a fairly recent decision, and I
have to look over the 5-year storyline to make sure it doesn't compromise
anything...if it does, then I'll have to find another solution.

     Was this at ALL helpful?

                                                                jms
