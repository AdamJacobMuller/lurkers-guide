     Yeah, there's kind of a good break-point about 6-7 pages into the script
that can be sliced off and used as a teaser, ending as it does with a bit of
an action scene.

     Re: weapons, we're sticking with the blaster/laser style gun, rather than
a projectile weapon, for several reasons: 1) a projectile weapon is MUCH
messier, and 2) you can set the intensity on a beam-style weapon so that it
can cut through flesh but not the metal of the hull...whereas a projectile
fired in a closed, metallic space that MISSES will richochet all over the
damned place.

     The key, then, becomes to do the beam effect DIFFERENTLY.  And we seem to
have a cool way of doing that.  I've discussed it with the EFX people, and
they seem to think it's do-able.  What I need now is some more tech info from
a couple of folks I know who are into the more scientific stuff, one of whom
is a physicist, to find out, if there WERE such things, how would they act?
The answers I've gotten thus far are very interesting, and open up all kinds
of possibilities.
