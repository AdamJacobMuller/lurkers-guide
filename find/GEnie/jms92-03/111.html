     Oh...glad you reminded me.  I'd forgotten.

     Will post something in the next 24 hours or thereabouts.

     BTW...one amongst us here has seen much of what B5 is going to be
about...characters, the bible, artwork, all that stuff.  If he would like to
comment -- as an objective point of view -- he's certainly more than welcome
to do so.  My thought, always, is that anything I say has to be considered
suspect because I have a vested interest, whereas if it comes from someone
else, it carries more weight.  (I ask others always to PROVE IT when someone
makes a claim, it behooves me to do the same.)
