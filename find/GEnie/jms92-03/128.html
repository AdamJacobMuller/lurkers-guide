     Tuesday is the night we're lock into at this stage, which is why November
17th (a Tuesday) was chosen.  Now, it's *possible* that the series might end
up on a different night, should the consortium decide to add another night to
the schedule, but that's still *very* much up in the air.

                                                               jms
