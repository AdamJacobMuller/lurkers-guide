     Nope, just busy with production details.  More meetings scheduled, and
being scheduled for this week...sound, casting, EFX and the like.

     I think we've got the weapons question fully licked; and the solution is
neither one, nor the other, but *both* (and I'll let you chew on that one for
a while).

     As we get closer to rolling film, I'll be skewing my "reports" here
slightly more toward production information and away from creative stuff, for
a variety of reasons, though from time to time we'll get into some of that.
At the moment, our main concern is getting the new, revised B5 onto film and
out of the computer.  We should have the first segments out and onto film in
the next 10 days or so.  (For those who are interested, there's as much
"surface" in the first one-fifth of the station as there was in the original
total B5 shown on the earlier demo.  That will literally enable us to get
within 100 feet of the thing with perfect clarity.)

     More as I can release it.

                                                                  jms
