    Thanks.  I kinda had fun with that M,SW episode, and trying to get the
flavor and language of the Irish dialect was both challenging and a great deal
of fun.  (It looks like I'll be writing a follow-up Irish episode for next
year.)

     And re: virtual reality/cyberspace...I was the first to commission a
virtual reality/cyberspace episode for television *ever*, on POWER, and be
assured I'll eventually get into that on B5 as well.

                                                                jms
