     As I mentioned before, there's *official* commitment, and what you can
thus announce...and what you can't.  It is my understanding that all we have
to do is bring the movie in on budget, and we're go for the series, we'll have
proven that we can do the kind of show that we promised.  And we can.  And we
will.  The show will follow, trust me.



     David: where exactly did this article appear?  This is very troubling.

     From the beginning, B5 has always included a casino, the subtle presence
of a brothel, customs areas, a marketplace, business areas, a nightclub/bar
and so on.  If this latest has any semblance to reality, this may have gone
too far.

     Please indicate the source, and date.  Thanks.
