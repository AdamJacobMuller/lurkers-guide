     Could be....

     Let us remember that the Medusa is a *legend*, the Minotaur is a
legend...legends are our way of dealing with things we don't fully understand.
Which ain't to say it ISN'T disinformation, or ISN'T in some way grounded in
some incident or other, only that all things are both possible and logical.

     More meetings today at Warners re: B5.  Tremendous enthusiasm for the
script.  Some money will begin flowing into the production budget from Warners
next week, and we figure on having the director locked down the first part of
the week.  Some discussion about whether or not we begin with a teaser...in a
way, a cold opening that grabs you up from the start, THEN later segues into
the opening titles ain't a bad idea.

     We're starting to get busy on this...memos flying around, lots of people
being hired and coming aboard, discussions about how many grips and sound guys
and wardrobe people and honey wagons we'll need...a show like this just sort
of sits around for a long time while everyone makes up his mind what to
do...and then when it begins grinding to life it REALLY starts to pick up
speed fast.

     One of our greatest concerns right now is the *look* of the show, now
that the script is finished.  We want something very unique, not quite film
noire but certainly a second cousin...texture, light against shadow...and the
whole concept of what the future will look like.

     Yikes.

     So what am I doing HERE?  I should be working!
