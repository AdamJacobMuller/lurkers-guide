     Well, all I can really suggest, if your area isn't covered, is to write
to the programming department at your local *non-network* TV station(s).
Those are the ones who are either being, or have been approached by Warners.
Suggest that they contact Warners, or indicate your interest in seeing the
program, based on what you've heard.

     And if, by the way, as an aside, you liked the look of THE EQUALIZER,
that kind of texture...the director we think we've settled on was largely
involved in that look, and did considerable directing work on that series, as
well as others...nice shadows, textures, profiles...as well as work on many
features.

                                                                   jms
