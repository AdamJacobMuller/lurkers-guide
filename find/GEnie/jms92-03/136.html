     Okay, black and silver it is.  Will go for the full-size logo in front,
in silver, and red slogan in back (I hadn't thought about the use of
red...cool idea).  Thanks for the input.

     BTW...for those interested, there's a decent-sized notice about B5 in the
current issue (#163) of STARBURST magazine, on page 7.  It gives some of the
background stuff as well as some good words about how it'll do.

     Onward.

                                                                  jms
