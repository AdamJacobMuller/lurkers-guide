     Matt: if you can reassure me...do so.  Otherwise, yes, there are ways to
find stuff out, but they're more time consuming.

     And to the above note...yes, we're still slated to come up first, with
the airdate still solid at November 17th.

     Just returned from another meeting with our EFX and production guys.
  The team is getting bigger with each meeting, as more guys are added on in
various capacities.  Today was a discussion of prosthetics, makeup, ship
design elements and the like.  The preliminary sketches are REALLY
interesting, and have a look unlike anything I've seen before on TV.   We're
especially setting aside time to work out how the B5 station will work, and
look, and it's undergoing some radical design changes that make what's out now
on the tape look like nothing.

     Oh, yeah...and will post some new speific info as soon as I can; it
'sbeen nuts these last few days.
