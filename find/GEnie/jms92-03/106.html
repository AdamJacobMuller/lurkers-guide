     So let me see if I've got this straight

     BABYLON 5 (a name followed by a number) for four years was always a space
station headed by an unmarried commander, at a major transit point for travel,
with representatives from different races on board, with a shapechanger a
pivotal story point in the movie, and with a variety of facilities including a
bordello and a casino.

     And now...as the story emerges....

     DEEPSPACE 9 (a name followed by a number) has become a space station
headed by an unmarried commander, at a major transit point for travel, with
representatives from different races on board, with a shapechanger a pivotal
story point in the movie, and with a variety of facilities including a
bordello and a casino.

     ...

     I was going to leave a much longer message, but the heart just went out
of me.  Will come back on line later.

                                                               jms
