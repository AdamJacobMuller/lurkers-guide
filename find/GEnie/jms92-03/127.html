     Fox network stations can carry it because it's on a Tuesday night for
starters, when Fox isn't sending out a network lineup.

     In perhaps the longest delayed-reaction in a while...if you have cable,
and get WOR, and none of your stations locally carry B5, you can pick it up
off WOR.  It's only when WOR brings the show into a local area where another
station carries it that it gets blacked out.  So you can either lobby your
local stations to carry it, or be sure that your cable operator carries WOR.

                                                                 jms
