     I note this here only because it came up on CIS, and I'd kinda like to
nip this in the bud.  Please don't take out any part of this on Michael.  If
you're going to be upset with anyone, be upset with me, since in the final
analysis, it's Doug and I who have to implement any decision, even when
mutually made.

     What happened at the beginning of the process is that we looked at the
coming season, and said (as I've noted on another system), that in the second
year, we can do X and Y, both of which are very cool.  But what if we did
something unexpected?  What if we took a chance, and tried a slightly
different direction, and set Sinclair aside for a while?  If we did that, we
could still do X and Y...and we could *also* do Z...and Z is very, VERY
interesting.  It opened up some very dramatic possibilities, allowing us to
expand the series and heighten the tension level.

     We talked to Michael, and he had some thoughts on this as well.  The
result was, as stated, a *mutual* decision.

     People here know how much B5 means to me.  I would never do anything, or
allow anyone else to do anything, to harm it.  This is my baby.  And this is
being done not because we will have to overcome this now somehow, but because
in the final analysis we think this will help the show, and give Michael some
flexibility as a side-effect.  I won't ask anyone to trust me, because in
Hollywood, "trust me" is a euphemism at best.  But this will all work out.

     In any event, though, if anyone's going to be upset in any way by this,
please direct it toward me, not toward Michael.  Fundamentally, the
responsibiliy rests on my shoulders, and Doug's.  But since Doug's not here,
I'll take it.

                                                                 jms
