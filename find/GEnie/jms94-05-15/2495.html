     I'll be happy to answer the question as soon as you can define for me
specifically what you mean when you say "soap opera."  Because it seems like
no two people mean it the same way.  What you seem to be referring to in your
message is characterization.  Maybe you couldn't care less about G'Kar's
religious ceremony, but it shows a very different side of G'Kar than we've
seen before.  That's important.

     I've said it elsewhere, but I'll say it here: I've never bought into the
strict definitions of what SF is.  If it happens in the future, on a space
station, involving starships, it's SF.  And I'd also point out that the
solution to G'Kar's and Londo's problem is a scientific solution using
lightspeed at its core.

     Also, I've always considered B5 speculative fiction, which isn't as
narrow as hard-core/technobabble science fiction (or, more properly, some
aspects of that area, since there has been a goodly amount of hard SF that
I've enjoyed and continue to enjoy).  To me, SF (either way) isn't about the
hardware, isn't about reversing the polarity on the tachyon emitter to reflux
the framitz.  It's looking to the future, and positing social and political
and religious questions.  How will society change by the year 2258?  How will
the government work?  How will we handle the development of telepaths?  How
will we get along with other life forms?   What will commerce be like?  That
is an *absolutely* valid definition of SF that has been showcased in some of
the best stories written in the SF genre.  I'd point you to "A Canticle for
Liebowitz" as just one example of one of the most famous books in SF, without
a *lick* of hardware/tech in it.

     Some SF fans don't like emotion in their stories.  They don't like
passion or people yelling or extremes.  They like their SF quiet and
reasonable and comfortable.  I don't want B5 to be a comfortable show.  I
don't want it to be spoken in a calm, reasonable voice.  I'm not in my office
now, but I have several quotes on my walls there (I note this because I can't
put author with quote from memory)..."Be uncomfortable.  Be sand, not oil, in
the machinery of the world."  "The point of no return, that is the point that
must be reached."

     B5 is a show that, at its best, is written at a dead run, that takes us
right to the edge.  That simply may not be your cup of tea.

     Which, I suspect, is earl grey.  Hot.
