     Actually, we kinda thought that major intersections like that would have
light-grids in the floors (there are arrows pointing the way to various
intersecting corridors) all over the place.  Hence why we didn't change them.

     One problem with putting in a different, replaceable "floor" is the noise
hassle.  The natural floor is reinforced, and *quiet* when you walk on it.
Any overlay (or underlay) is going to result in bounceback and creaking and
other audio problems that'll require dubbing in post.

      But we'll look at it again, and see what else we can do here.
