     BTW...while I'm on the topic...for anyone who wonders why I just sit and
despair some days...I pass along to you the following, from the June 1994
issue of Satellite ORBIT magazine, page 23, in a roundup of SF series.

     "Deep Space Nine is remarkably close in theme and premise to another
recent syndicated series, Babylon 5, probably because in Joe Straczynski, they
share a writer-producer."

     So just for starters, now I'm a writer-producer working on DS9.

     "Michael O'Hare plays the station's commander, in the words of one wag,
as if he were 'Lorne Greene under hypnosis.'"

     This should start to give you a clue: if a reviewer has to quote another
reviewer (I think that one came from People), it probably means he hasn't seen
the show he or she is reviewing.  How can we now verify this?

     "Even the presence of Claudia Christian, who plays Babylon 5's second in
command with the worst Russian accent you've ever heard, can't redeem this
one."

     Okay, now, folks, maybe I'm confused, what do I know, I just created the
show, I just executive produce the thing, I just see every frame of film a
zillion times...but...am I nuts or am I correct in the notion that Claudia
doesn't PLAY the part with an accent?  She doesn't DO a Russian accent.
Anywhere.  Anytime.

     This reviewer-critter, Art Durbano, has clearly never even SEEN an
episode of the show, and can't even be bothered to get his facts straight.

     We never get a break.  Ever.

                                                                     jms
