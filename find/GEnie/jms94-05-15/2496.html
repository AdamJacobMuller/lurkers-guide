     One thing that got somewhat short shrift this season were the personal
stories of the humans.  We learn a *lot* more about the Minbari, for instance,
than we really learn about Garibaldi, for instance.  So we're going to
increase that side of things a bit, so people can get to know our characters a
little better.  It's just doing a bit more for the humans what we did for the
aliens.  And it's really time for that; we now have a pretty good idea who the
alien players are by now...time to bolster the other side a bit.

                                                                  jms
