     Mr. T...actually, yes, we did audition a *lot* of Russian actors for the
part.  And we had to go back and forth, do we want an accent or do we not want
an accent?  Which kind of russian do we do?  Finally we simply fell back to
our position of "Whoever walks into the room and blows us away gets the job."
Claudia did that.
