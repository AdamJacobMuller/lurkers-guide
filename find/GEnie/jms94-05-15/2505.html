     Which is one of the interesting things I thought could be explored
here...up until now, Garibaldi has always had someone who would believe him,
back him up...how does he deal with someone new?  (Especially after the events
in "Chrysalis;" you'll understand when you see it.)  For the most part,
Garibaldi has been pretty self-assured; this, and one other incident, will
knock the pins out from under him a little, which gives us some *very*
interesting dynamics to explore, just for starters.

for a while.  He has to go somewhere.  And at some point, at least in my
planning, he will return from there.  This is far more about the character,
and the characters *around* him.

     Cyberdad: thanks.  That means a lot.

     It's always interesting, if you have one character upon whom everyone
else leans, even depends, to *remove* that character for a time.  Because then
those characters have to *react*...to either stand or fall on their own.  It
shakes things up a little...and vastly intensifies the characters.

                                                                     jms
