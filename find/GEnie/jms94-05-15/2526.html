     Larry wrote the shiva stuff all on his lonesome.  As for being an
abbreviated version...apparently shiva lasts 3 days for someone recently

deceased.  If it's been months since the death, the service is usually much
shorter, and again, there was only Ivanova and Koslov who actually were part
of or knew the deceased.
