     Linda, you have not been suckered.  Whether or not you believe this, is
something I can't help.  The story has not been sacrificed.  I would not be
sitting here as calmly as I am if that were true.  I understand that you are
upset.  But if you were caught up in the character, it's because the story
*worked*.  You saw that there is a bigger story here, you saw the bits and
pieces coming together.  So there *is* a story, and that story will continue.
All I can ask is that you see what we're going to do, and judge that.  If I
genuinely thought that the story was screwed, I'd leave the show.  Because the
only reason to DO the show is to tell this story.  You have invested 13 hours
into this story; I have invested seven *years*.  And you don't toss aside 7
years because of an inconvenience.  The concept *is* what was sold to you.
But again, nothing that I can say will likely convince you of this...just as
nothing that I could say at the beginning could convince many people that we
were serious about doing an adult SF series, that would rank with Trek.  (One
person, prior to the election, upon hearing that ambition, snorted, "Yeah,
right, and Clinton will be president.")  What I said then, I say now: watch,
and judge from the reality.  Don't take my word for it.

     And I'm still standing beside that promise to tell the story that I
intend to tell.

                                                                 jms
