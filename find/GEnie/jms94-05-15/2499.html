     The arc remains untouched.  For starters, the arc as written was designed
to emphasize the aliens and the Battle of the Line in season one; build the
universe and set the pieces in motion.  Year two brings the humans into play
in the universe that season one created.  There's a reason Morden didn't go to
the Earth Alliance.

     Let me be clear on this: *no* arc-related stories will be sacrificed, at
all.  We're talking mainly in terms of B stories, not A stories.  Most of our
season 1 B stories concentrated on the alien ambassadors; Ivanova really gets
only two strong B stories, and some smaller ones; Delenn gets something like
six.  It's just a question of finding the balance.

                                                                 jms
