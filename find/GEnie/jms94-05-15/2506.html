     KB: thanks.

     Rhonda: Claudia Christian's done a *lot* of stuff, mostly film, including
"Hexed."  As for why Russian...that's in my blood, and I've rarely seen a
Russian character really done *right*, not a cliche, not "Yes, ve invent
everytink goot in world, da?" but the dark, pessimistic humor, the
introspection, the formality, the heart and the doomed viewpoint that is so
uniquely Russian.  So if you can't find it anywhere else, do it yourself.
