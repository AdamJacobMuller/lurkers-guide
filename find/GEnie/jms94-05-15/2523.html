     I suggested a novel set in the Line, but the editor felt that at first,
to help marketing the novels should be set in the B5 present; that fans will
be disappointed and not buy books if they're not using all of the characters
in their current situation.  At least, that seems to be her take for the first
batch, but down the road she has no problem with the idea.

                                                                jms
