     Here's a little sidelight for you.

     As I've noted before, over the long haul, as you watch episodes, you will
see things you didn't see before.  Sometimes they're clues, and sometimes
they're comments which now read a different way than they did the first time
you saw them.  There's been a number of the latter very subtly sprinkled
through the episodes aired so far...lines that everyone jumped on as meaning
one thing, but which will mean something else, and lines which nobody thought
much of the first time out...but which will elicit a wince of irony later on.


     There's a corker in "TKO," but at the moment, it's absolutely invisible.
It's not a clue, it's not necessary for the story, it's just one of those
things that, after you've seen all the rest of this season's episodes, you
will go "Ouch," when you see it next.

                                                                jms
