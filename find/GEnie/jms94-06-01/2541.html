     The only things we're doing to the uniforms is adjusting the dress
uniforms a bit, and adding a bit of seam to the back of the class-A day
jackets to help them fit a little better, and a bit of slightly different
piping along the leather collars so they'll read better on camera.  Also we'll
be making a new set out of a slightly more durable and comfortable gabardine
than last season.

     Re: production...each episode shoots in 7 days, and yes, when one show
comes in under the pattern budget (which often happens), we then  apply that
to other shows.  We came in a bit under budget for the full season, and have
applied that bit to next season's budget to give us a bit more room to play.

     I write 10-20 pages a day, usually on more than one script or project at
the same time.  Net messages in total add proably another 5-7 pages a day to
the list.  (Currently doing 2 B5 scripts, revising a 2-hour pilot for another
series, editing others, awaiting word on an outline for a third pilot, and
some other stuff.)
