     I don't think they have time for that kind of heavy-duty rendering; the
closest they ever got (at least that *I'm* aware of) is a composite shot
looking through the observation dome window from the outside, to where Ren
Hoek is strangling Stimpy inside.  (It's a gif.)  And no, you can't have it.
