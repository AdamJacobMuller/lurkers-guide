     We do see some EA military types from time to time (it was an EA marine
who kept trying to pick up on ko'dath in "Purple").  And next season there'll
be a bit more of that, with more supplies and people being moved out to the
Rim, and stopping off at B5 en route.

     Re: Babylon...while it didn't end up well, for a long time Babylon was a
center of commerce and industry, an important crossroads.  The name translated
means "the Gate of God," which has double meaning when attached to the
jumpgate outside.
