     A *lot* of background on the characters appears in the faq file, which I
believe is available here.

     Wouldn't be surprised to see a B5 tech manual sometime next year os (or)
so.

     Workers employed on B5 earn a weekly salary, paid in earth standard
credits.  Anyone coming from another culture/system with a different financial
structure is handled as you would handle going from the US to Germany.  You
turn over your Drazi currency, and are given a credit chit which is charged
with X-amount of EA credits, based on the current rate of exchange.  If your
system is not recognized by EA, things get a little dicier, and you may be
forced to resort to barter.

                                                                jms
