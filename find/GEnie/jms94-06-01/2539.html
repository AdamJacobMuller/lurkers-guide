     Alas, corridor walls that curve in make lighting and setting up camera
angles VERY difficult.

     At this point, not much in the way of new aliens planned; we'd like to
get away from the alien-of-the-week story (which though we didn't do it a
*lot*, we did it enough that I want to edge away from it a bit), and
concentrate on the aliens we already have.  If you just keep on throwing new
aliens into the mix, soon it loses all impact.  We decided to try a whole
bunch of aliens over season one, and pick the ones that worked, which we would
then work to refine and integrate more fully into the storyline.   Right now,
I think we've got about 15 races in addition to our primary groups (Narn,
Minbari, Centauri).  Concomitant with this, we'll be working to make the
prosthetics far more detailed and better able to be used in a dramatic
context.

     We scattergunned a lot in season one; now is the time to adjust, refine,
focus and improve.  We'll still do the occasional new group, I  just don't
want that to begin driving the show.

                                                                  jms
