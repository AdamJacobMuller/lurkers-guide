     I read Bugs' note, and to his considerable credit, he had pieced together
a *lot* of stuff.  Moreso than has just about anyone else to date.  It
ultimately led him to make one final leap that took him onto the wrong track,
so the destination was in error, but he had done his homework, thought things
through, and was very much on the right track.   There's just some stuff that
can't be predicted because the necessary pieces aren't all on the table yet.

     So good thinking, excellent deductions, careful consideration, just off
by a few decimals.  It is, I suppose, the difference between E=MC2 and E=MC3;
you kinda had to know where you were going and what you were doing to get that
far, but the bomb still ain't gonna work.

                                                                 jms
