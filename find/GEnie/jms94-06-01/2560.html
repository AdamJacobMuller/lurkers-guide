     I think that the point he was going after in his original posting is that
some -- a very few -- take a *proprietary* stance, which I would differentiate
from criticism (pro or con) in terms of the sense of perceived ownership.
There are a few ST fans, for instance, who feel, and even state to the effect,
that as fans they *own* the show.  There was the person who said that he has
the *right* to *dictate changes* in the show (B5) because he watched it.  And
the answer to that in both cases is, No, you don't.

     There is a small section of the fan community that will applaud you for
standing up to and resisting input from the suits, the studios, and the
network, and then turn *very* cranky when you similarly resist THEIR input,
because THEY own the show.

     This line becomes somewhat easier to cross when someone from the show
makes himself available for such things.

     I think that this was the point at hand, rather than criticism vs.
praise.
