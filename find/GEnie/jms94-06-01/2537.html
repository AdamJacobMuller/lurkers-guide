     Bits and pieces...heard today from Jim Norton, who plays our Ombuds on
the show, and is currently in England doing a documentary about Gen.
Montgomery (playing the lead), who was wearing his B5 jacket on Kings Road,
and just about got mobbed by people.  Apparently the show is going over well.

     Assignments are being made, scripts are in the works.  First draft on
"Chrysalis, Part Two" is in (JMS), and Larry's working on "A Trick of the
Mind" and DC's working on "A Distant Star."

     We're doing a pretty fair amount of rethinking on some of our sets and
costumes, again looking to improve them as much as we can from season to
season without making major changes.  We'll be doing more with set dressing,
making it more layered and personal; building some new sets to let us explore
other sides of our characters' lives; coming up with new costume designs for
some of the new characters coming in this season, that sort of thing.

     New production schedule came out, and it looks like if we begin shooting
on July 18 we'll be delivering episodes several months before they're due to
air.  So we're giving some thought to starting filming a couple weeks later,
just to give us more time to tinker with the sets and costumes without having
to rush.  There's a couple of sets in particular that we'll be creating for
the first couple of episodes we shoot, and the extra time could be useful in
getting them just right, since they're fairly elaborate.  (And Londo gets a
new coat this season!)
 I'll probably have a bit more to say about the new additions to the cast
later on.  Not regulars, but recurring (6 episodes or so) characters.

     Today went down to Sotheby's in Beverly Hills to look at their stuff for
their newest auction, mainly comics stuff.  Got the auction catalog, brought
it home, started marking pages...wish lists...walked out to where Kathryn was
watching the NBA game..."So, like, exactly how do you feel about a second
mortgage?"

     Such a look.....

     Sigh...I've long described myself as a collector of Superman stuff.
HAH!  Trinkets.  There's some SERIOUS stuff out there, boys and girls.

     Bottom line...I'm doomed as doomed can be....

                                                               jms
