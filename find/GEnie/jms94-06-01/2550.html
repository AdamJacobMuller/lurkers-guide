     I don't think I've really said that much about "Grail."  The trick,
though, is that I don't approach the episodes in quite the same way that a
viewer does.  I have somewhat different agendas and goals, and there are times
when hassles in *doing* the episode -- which in no way affect the show itself -
- affects my *perception* of the episode.

     I did a small screening of "Grail" here about a week ago, to get some
other reactions, and they were all very positive; they enjoyed the episode
quite a bit.  (Similarly, there were people who thought that "Infection" was
one of the best of the season.)  There is *no one* who is harsher in
critiquing the episodes than I am.  I want each one to be absolutely perfect.
And sometimes that means that I see flaws that no one else ever will.

     In any event, I definitely want people to come at this from an open
minded point of view.  For reasons that have nothing to do with Christy's
script, it still isn't one of my all-time favorite episodes; if I said
otherwise, I'd be lying through my teeth.  But different opinions are what
makes horse races, and as stated, most of those who've seen it so far *do*
like it, so at the moment I'm considerably outnumbered....

                                                                   jms
