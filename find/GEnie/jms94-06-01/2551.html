     Arne, let me respectfully disagree with you.  An occasional typo is one
thing; sometimes there can be SO many typos in someone's message that it
becomes twice as hard to read, it can get annoying, and if the author's intent
was to say X, a lot of typos can result in communicating Y, or people simply
not bothering to read it at all.

     "core shuttkle...lety me anylyse...teh shodows...seeming huige...on te'he
ground...there was abotyher...teh distant...prettyh bnut...."

     Granted, it's a prejudice, but this sort of thing also makes the writer
look illiterate, though clearly he is not, but that nonetheless prejudices the
reader, and diminishes the impact of the message.  There is nothing wrong with
occasional correction; that's one of the problems with SF fandom in general, I
think...no one ever dares to correct anyone else.

     If I can come on here and take comments criticizing my show, then I think
that someone critiquing the effects in my show can take a little critiquing of
his message, done in a positive way.  If he can't take a note or two, then he
can tell us.

                                                                 jms
