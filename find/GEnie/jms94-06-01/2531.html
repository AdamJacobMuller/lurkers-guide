     I spoke incorrectly; the scene will be used in year two, not year one.

     We're trying to get them to move the showing of Chrysalis back into
August, with the rest of the year 1 episodes, rather than just before the
start of year two.  Warners logic behind that is their belief that a) they can
generate more publicity for the new season, which will spill into Chrysalis
and thus get more people to see it, making kind of an event out of it, and b)
the HUT (households using televisions) for August are notoriously low, so they
feel it would be wasting what's probably our strongest episodes.

     But I'd still prefer to see it in August, and we're still trying to nudge
Warners in that direction.

                                                                jms
