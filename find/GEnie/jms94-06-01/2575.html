     Bear in mind, though, when suggesting all this heavy weaponry, that
Babylon 5 is not a warship.  It's not that major a target.  It generally has
enough to protect itself against small forces.  If full-scale war were to
break loose, *nothing* could protect it from a fleet of ships, since it can't
maneuver and is basically a sitting duck.

                                                                jms
