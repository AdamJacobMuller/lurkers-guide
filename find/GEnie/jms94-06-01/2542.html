     Argus: of course there are capital ships.  We never said otherwise.
There's one later this season, for instance, the EAS Hyperion, a heavy Earth
cruiser.  There aren't as many as they'd like -- the majority having been
wiped out in the war -- but they're building 'em as fast as possible.  (The
Hyperion, though it's never mentioned, is one of the leftover capital ships,
not one of the newer ones.)

     The uniforms are *not* being changed dramatically, only nipped and tucked
and tweaked slightly to make them fit better and come across slightly better
on-camera, so some details that're being lost now pop better.

     Re: starfury pilots...some of it is actors in cockpit against a blue
screen, some of it CGI pilots with faces mapped onto them.

                                                                 jms
