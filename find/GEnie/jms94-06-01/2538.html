     BTW, for those in the San Diego area, Harlan Ellison will be signing
books this coming Saturday from 2-5 p.m. at Mysterious Galaxy Books, in the
Claremont Square Shopping Center, 4679 Claremont Square.  And at 6 p.m., he
will read a new short story to an audience of those who've bought Mephisto in
Onyx or Mind Fields *and* purchased $25 in books from the store.

     I'll be there as well, on and off starting about 2, though Harlan is the
main show.  Any GEIs who want to buy some stuff and come by are of course
welcome.

                                                               jms
