     Kwicker, Ivanova has *not* said stuff about being Russian "every other
episode."  I made the error of having her say it twice in the two-parter, now
everybody's seeing it as a big thing.  It was mentined in Soul Hunter,
Survivors, and Voice, and insofar as I know, that's it.  (I'll allow for the
possibility of one more, even though I don't recall any others.)  I don't
think that 3-4 episodes in a 22 episode season quite qualifies as "every other
episode."

                                                                  jms
