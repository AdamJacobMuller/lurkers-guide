     Two weeks ago, B5 was #20 in the ratings.  This past week it came in #18.
That's overall, including game shows, talk shows, you name it.  It's a
definite, strong increase.  We've been increasing our ratings by about 10-25%
every week, consistently, for the last 7 weeks.

     And as noted above...nope, don't do cameos.

                                                                   jms
