     A B5 cdrom coming out in the spring will have a lot of that info.   As
for the filming...yes, we shoot in widescreen but protect for normal aspect
ratios.  We've now begun the process of reconverting back to the original
aspect ratio for foreign and eventual laserdisk release.  I will be getting
the first copies of widescreen versions on tape over the next few months.
