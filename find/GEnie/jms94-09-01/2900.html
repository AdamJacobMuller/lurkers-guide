     I wasn't yelling at Perianne, only responding to the info that she passed
along, which I've heard elsewhere.  If the con knew that I was not coming, nor
was anyone else on the show, and they *did* know, then that panel shouldn't
have been on the schedule to begin with.  And then to say that I blithely
canceled, or just got "too busy" to do something for the con, and didn't tell
anybody until the last minute...this is cheapjack behavior, and makes me look
really bad, and I don't like it.
