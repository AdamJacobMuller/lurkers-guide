     Given that my office is nowhere near Universal anymore, alas, I could not
see you, even with my EMF enhanced Producer-Vision (tm).

     During the time I *was* working on the Universal lot -- first on Jake,
later for two years on Murder -- I did go up to the park a lot, prior to the
construction of the City Walk, to nab lunch at something other than the
commissary.  You could walk on and off the park, if you worked at the studio.
Used to walk past folks from all over the world, who keep peering around
looking for somebody who might work in TeeVee or movies (and naturally the
stars never go near the place), not knowing that the person at their elbow
with the hot dog under the huge poster of Angela Lansbury was a producer on
that show.

     Naturally, they waited until after I'd left Universal to put up the City
Walk, which now has all KINDS of places to eat....
