     I think that if any of the characters recognized the parallel arc from
the original Babylon it would move us too far into metafiction; I'm dancing on
the edge of that in a few places, but don't want to go too far.

     Mary Jo brings in actors to audition, but final decisions are made by me,
Doug, John and the director.

                                                                  jms
