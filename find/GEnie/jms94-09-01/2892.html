     I think that to some degree, people haven't come to terms with the
reality that BBSing is no longer a quiet little corner where nobody ever
notices us and we can say what we want.  This is now part of the Great
Information Highway (so they tell us).  This stuff gets circulated all over
the place.  (Anybody who thinks the writers at ST don't see the often
astonishing things said about them is quite wrong.)  The little room party is
now being held in the ballroom...and the whole world is watching....
