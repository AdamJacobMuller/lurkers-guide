     This is Kung Fu's last season, yes.

     Mike: the Disney situation is unique to Disney; they are all
engulfing, totally dictatorial, and everything that comes out of there is
incestuous as hell.  There's a reason most anybody who's worked for them 
refers to the place as Mauschwitz....

     RE: Space A&amp;B...yes, the word is it's been canceled.  It's
amazing to look at the SF shows that have come and gone just in the time 
that B5 has been around: S:A&amp;B, Space Rangers, VR5, SeaQuest, Earth 2, 
and on.

                                                                  jms
