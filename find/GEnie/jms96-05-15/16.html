     The new edition is, basically, an entirely new book.  One of the
reasons it took me 3 years to get the damned thing in was that I'm a
perfectionist, and couldn't just update the pay info, I had to rewrite 
the thing from stem to stern (I think only the playwriting chapter is 
more or less the same), updating all the information, tossing aside 
suggestinos (suggestions) that were no longer appropriate in this market, 
adding new info about changes in the fields, adding new chapters on 
animation, computers, and the like...it's a whole different book now.

                                                                 jms
