     Loops: get the hell away from my office window.  I can see you out there
with my x-ray specs.

     Y'know...people wonder sometimes why I get a little exasperated with
Paramount from time to time.  Here's a few reasons.

     Back when the Arsenio Show was still on the air, Stephen Furst was set to
appear on the show.  Suddenly, they canceled.  According to Stephen, he was
told on the QT that it was because Paramount heard about it, and didn't want
to promote B5.

     Back at the top of the season, we'd met with Winrich Kolbe about doing
some of our episodes (he does a lot of TNG, DS9 and now Voyager directing).
 Nice guy, we met, we agreed, and a date was set.  All parties agreed to it,
we had a deal.  Not long before the episode comes up, his rep calls to get him
out of it...at first muttering about some vague, ill-defined TV movie
Paramount wanted him to do, but we'd had this for a long time...then his rep
was finally asked, "Look, does this have anything to do with the big boys at
Paramount leaning on you because it's B5?"  The rep reluctantly admitted that
this was the case.  We released Kolbe from his assignment.

     Now, finally, B5 is getting some press, some word of mouth; mostly about
this show called Babylon something.  Well, UPN just announced that they're
doing a new detective series for the UPN stations, the majority of which are
also B5 stations.  And guess what they've announced the title is?  BABYLON.
You think maybe some folks'll get confused about which show this is, given
that they're both on the same station in many places?

     The roster of such things goes on, and on, and on.

     But it's not stopping us.  Inch by inch, we continue to fight our way
into the ratings.

                                                                    jms
