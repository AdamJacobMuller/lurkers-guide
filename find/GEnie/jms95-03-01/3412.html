     Since I've been meaning to post the info here in answer to requests:
really nifty B5 t-shirts and caps can now be ordered directly from All-U at 1-
800-424-2558, ext. 105.  T-shirts (great color images) and caps are $17, and
the LONG SLEEVE t-shirts are $25, plus shipping and handling.   The shirts
they have now are 1) original cast photo with station, 2) new cast photo with
station, the B5 logo with station and the words "the last best hope..." 4)
station, planet and logo, and 5) station and starfury, all color.

                                                                   jms
