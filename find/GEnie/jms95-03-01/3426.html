     Re: Kosh's voice carrying some emotion...starting at about "All Alone in
the Night," or maybe one before (memory fades), I took on the job of directing
the voice sessions for Kosh.  He was moving from a neutral delivery to things
that had to carry specific emotions and implications for the future, and
nobody else knows what all this stuff means, so it fell to me.
