     A totally irrelevant aside...does ANYbody here know ANYbody from the Ben
and Jerry Ice Cream company?  If so, I have a message for them.

     HEY!  PAY ATTENTION!  Did you know that there is NO ONE out there making
banana ice cream?  I don't mean banana mix with those crummy walnuts in them,
or sometimes a little banana cream stuffed into an ice bar, or those sticky
banana ice-milk bars....I'm talking here STRAIGHT BANANA ICE CREAM.  Go ahead,
check out any supermarket's frozen section.  You've got cherry, strawberry,
chocolate, coffee, rum-raisen, white russian, vanilla, french vanilla,
neopolitan...row after row of ice creams of every sort and flavor and
packaging...EXCEPT BANANA.  I KNOW.  I'VE SPENT THE LAST SEVEN YEARS SEARCHING
FOR IT!

     Ben...Jerry...SOMEBODY...make up some banana ice cream and you'll have
the corner on the entire market.  Trust me on this.

                                                                  jms
