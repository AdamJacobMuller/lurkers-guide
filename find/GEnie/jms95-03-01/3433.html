      There's a dangerous irony here; the ST episode "Inner Light" was
objectively the one stand-out episode of that season, and thus won.  The
problem I've detected in posts from people about B5 is determining WHICH
episode to nominate, since there are apparently many choices.  If you end up
splitting the vote among lots of shows, *none* of them will get on the ballot
or winning.

      So if you're going to push B5, you may want to get together on one ep
that is always included (like "Signs," which is what I'd pick).  Just a
thought, since the issue at hand may not be which single ep is one's
subjective best, but recognizing the series overall.

                                                                    jms
