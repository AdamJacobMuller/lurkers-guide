     Actually, the idea that people coming into the story now will have a hard
time is something of a myth; we continue to add new viewers all the time, and
in some countries the show is actually being shown out of  order; to date I
have seen at most 1 or 2 people who were unsure about one aspect or another
after seeing just one episode, but were still able to follow the story easily
enough.  You may not know what it means in relation to something that happened
6 months ago, but what it means *now* is very clear, and all the information
needed is always included in the episode.

     Re: raiding myself (ST comic)...I stopped raiding myself, what with all
this Jocelyn Elders controversy....
