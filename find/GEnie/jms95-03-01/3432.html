     There are some *nifty* B5 t-shirts and caps available from All-U at 1-800-
424-2558, ext. 105.  The shirts are color, nice screening process...just very
well done.  Prices are very reasonable.  I commend them to you.  (They're now
available direct from All-U, which previously shipped mainly to distributers.)
