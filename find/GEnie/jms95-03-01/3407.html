     We hadn't thought much about it (maybe because I'm kinda tall), but
Bruce, Jerry, Claudia, Richard, Andreas...they're all *really* tall, which has
kinda come back to bite us at times on casting, because if we have to have a
baddie, or someone against whom they must go, we have to be sure they operate
at the same height area (usually), or it'll look goofy.

     BTW...I'm pleased to announce that the latest survey from Viewers For
Quality Television (VQT) has chosen Babylon 5 as the #1 ranked syndicated
series, and #16 overall, beating such network/non-network shows as Murphy
Brown, DS9, Seinfeld, Lois and Clark, Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman and The
Simpsons, among others, in their ranking of Highest Quality Shows.

     Thanks to all those who downloaded (and continue to download) the VQT
survey forms, for helping draw people's attention to the hard work being done
on Babylon 5.
