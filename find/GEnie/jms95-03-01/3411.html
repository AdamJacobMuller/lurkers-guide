     I haven't used my pool in a year and a half because I'm too busy behind
the keyboard to take a dip.  Honest.  And making ice cream isn't something I
can even think of making the time for.  Thank goodness I have a policy of not
getting involved in my own life....

     Believe it or not, I worked with Laura Dern once upon a time, before  she
was LAURA DERN.  When Showtime produced my adaptation of "The Strange Case of
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde," through Shelley Duvall's company, she and Anthony
Andrews were cast as the leads.  Even though she was noted even then mainly
for being Bruce Dern's daughter, she was very sweet and talented and you could
see real talent there.

                                                                   jms
