     I'll talk to Ron, see about a 24-bit JPEG.  My main thought was not so
much in excellence of individual gifs, but to get the most accessible files to
the most amount of people in the least amount of time.  (I get the feeling
that there's a math equation in there somewhere....)

     A funny aside, btw...it's an uphill battle getting the word out about B5
to *most* places...but you would not believe how many TNG production people
have been calling over the last week or so, offering to jump ship.  So I guess
SOME people are hearing about it....

     I'm *really* looking forward to reactions to the photos here.  I've been
rattling on about all this stuff for so long, and the majority of you here are
pretty much taking me at face value, which is okay, but I think it's so much
better when one can PROVE the point.  As stated: talk is cheap.  Now just
about any person with a color VGA monitor (or even a CGA, I suppose) can
actually get a visual sense of what we're doing, and SEE for themselves at
least a little of what we have in mind.  And to me, that's exciting.

     So now that the Media*West stuff has finally been ironed out, I'm really
looking forward to seeing the reactions there when I trot out the new
tape...with a moving B5 station...and a moving Vorlon ship...and some other
neat stuff.  We *really* want to knock people's socks off, Ron most of all.
Every night, he goes to bed muttering to himself, "Emmy...Emmy...
Emmy...Emmy."
