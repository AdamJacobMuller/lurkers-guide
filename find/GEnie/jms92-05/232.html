    I see no conflict with being able to attend, and since we'll have just
finished filming about a week earlier, I should have all KINDS of stuff to
bring.  What I have to do now is contact the programming people there and try
to set it up.  Given the magnitude of the con, it's one that I think I should
definitely attend.

     Basically, what I plan to do during filming is to set aside certain
scenes from dailies as we see them, and thus cumulatively build up a demo reel
as we go.  Then lay in the EFX shots (some of them, anyway), and by the time
we're finished, the demo should be ready to go.

                                                                jms
