    Okay, everybody, here's something spiffy.

     I just uploaded two GIF files to the televison library here in the SFRT.
They are numbers 4238 and 4239.  The first is a shot of the planet around
which B5 orbits, and the moon, and just emerging out of shadow...a Vorlon
ship.  It's a little dark around the ship, and that's deliberate, because
there are some details we're trying to keep, um, fairly secret from prying
eyes.  But this should give you a pretty good idea.

     The second file is a shot of the new B5 station itself.  It's a nearly
straight-on shot, with the docking bay in the foreground, the station trailing
away in the distance, against space.

     These are not, I hasten to mention, simply illustrations or paintings,
these are the actual shots from the film.  I mention that because they're SO
gorgeous that it's hard to believe that they'll actually move.  But they do.

     The files will be available as soon as the sysops clear them.

     Let me know what you think.

                                                                  jms
