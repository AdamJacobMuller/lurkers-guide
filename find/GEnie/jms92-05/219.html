     The shirts arrived this past Monday, the 18th.

     I guess CSHOW, available on most BBSs, will work even on a 16 color
monitor, though I don't know how good it'll be.  Might be okay.  Regular 256
color VGA is pretty good, though a little ragged.  Looked at here, on an NEC
4FG and an Orchid Fahrenheit card with 1 meg video memory, it looks terrific.

                                                                 jms
