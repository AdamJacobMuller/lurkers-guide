     To avoid charring this topic, I'm going to leave my screed about
Media*West in that topic.  Those involved there can check it out.  The
rest...stay tuned here.  I mention this here only because of the B5
presentation originally "slated" to take place there.

     We now return you to your regularly scheduled program.

                                                                  jms
