     Ray...given what came back to me about your earlier "discussion" with Mr.
Gerrold, don't you think you ought to stay out of his face for a while?

     (cross-posting is so much fun)

     BTW...by the end of this coming week, we should be able to announce the
full production staff.  We have all but the casting director and one of the
line producers, who we'll lock down this week, but have been holding back
announcing the others until contracts are signed.

                                                            jms
