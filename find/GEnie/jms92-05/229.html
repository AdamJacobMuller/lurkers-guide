     Long day, so this'll be quick, but I just wanted to let y'all know that
there's an interesting mention of B5 in the current (June) issue of STARLOG,
in Kerry O'Quinn's "From the Bridge" column.  Kinda reinforces what we've been
saying all along in terms of our attitude and approach on this show.

      Other than that...I'm bushed.  Very productive and good day, some major
stuff got done.  Will try to get through some of the issues raised on a later
post.  And will talk to Ron about getting a 24-bit image at some point in the
future.  Right now he's mainly focusing on getting the main B5 stuff done, and
anything else is a distraction.  Give me time.

                                                              jms
