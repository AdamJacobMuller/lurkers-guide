     The motion tests are *complete*, fully ray-traced, full color, the whole
bit.  That's what makes it so spectacular.

     I'll see Ron this afternoon, and will ask about a Genie RTC.  I'm sure
he'd be up for it, probably sometime later in the year, closer to airdate
would be best.

     May have something interesting to upload later today.  Or not.   Depends
on what Ron has for me.

                                                                 jms
