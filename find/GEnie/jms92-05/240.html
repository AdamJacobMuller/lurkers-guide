     There's a text file in the library here that should function as a press
release, I think...that is, I *think* I uploaded it...take a look, and if
there's not a release file, let me know and I'll upload it.

     The Gifs may be further uploaded, with the copyright information
contained in the library here attached.

                                                                  jms
