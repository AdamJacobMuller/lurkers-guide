     The reason that the sections are round is because that's the most logical
and accepted scientific approach that we can figure out.  Which is something
also different about this show, and the look of the station: though some of
the inner sections will be flat floors, by and large all of the main corridors
will be *rounded* or curved.  Hence, a curved exterior.

     Glad you're enjoying the "view" -- and, again, just a reminder that these
aren't illustrations, but actual video from the project.

                                                                jms
