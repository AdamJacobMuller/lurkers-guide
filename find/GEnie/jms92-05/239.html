     Actually, funny thing about the WD article...the focus of the piece, and
the issue, is "Breaking In."  I was told the deadline was the end of July.
But the more I thought about it, the more I began to see what I really wanted
to say.  I jotted down a couple of notes.   Then an opening paragraph.  Next
thing I knew, I was well into it, and burned through the 3,000 words almost
all in one sitting.

     Whether or not it's what anyone really wants to hear, I'll find out, I
guess.

     (And I *did* catch the reference, Sue.  So, YOU'RE the one who reads my
column....)

    BTW, there's something familiar about your name, but I can't place it for
some reason...though maybe I'm just hallucinating again.

                                                                 jms
