     Mind, this isn't a 24 bit Amiga image, though it *began* that way,
certainly, but it would take an hour to download.  So it's been converted to a
standard 640x480 (or in one case, 751x520) 256 color image.  But it still
looks pretty spiffy, though the blue nebula got a bit "chunky" in the
transition to a Gif image.

                                                                   jms
