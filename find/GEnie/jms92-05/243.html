     That's one of the good things about Ron...he knows the Toaster and
related technologies inside out.  In addition, he has an associate -- I
believe provided by NewTek -- who is providing new codes, and new systems, and
new hardware customized per Ron's requests.  Stuff that no one had ever
thought to put into a computer because there'd never been a call for it
before.  As a result, Ron has capabilities and software that very literally
did not exist two months ago or, in one particular case, two WEEKS ago.

     The other result will be in everyone's benefit, in that this stuff is
fast becoming VERY advanced, much more powerful than anyone had previously
conceived.  Which fundamentally benefits the consumers.
