     I don't know the impact yet that the Fox move will have, if any, on the
B5/Warners lineup, but I'll inquire when I'm over at the studio this Friday.
It's almost a sure bet, though, that Fox sped up its schedule in order to try
and block the Warners move.

     Y'know, I have worked on a lot of shows.  A LOT of shows.  And I have
NEVER seen a situation like this where it seems everyone on the planet is in
our face...that Other Show, Fox, the press (which keeps forgetting we
exist)...David and Goliath, I don't mind.  David and a LOT of Goliaths is a
*real* pain in the butt.

                                                               jms
