     On the two different shows/rules idea...this is something I noticed from
way back.  People saw "Earth future, spacefaring races, a major commanding
officer," and assumed that we would be just like Star Trek.   When we weren't,
many assumed we were doing Star Trek BADLY, not understanding that it's a
*different show*.  The biggest crime of this show toa lot of people is that
we're not Trek.  It's only over time that some of these folks (though not all)
have come to understand what we're doing.
