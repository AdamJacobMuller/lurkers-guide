     I was kinda hoping that they'd continue the season one reruns as well,
but PTEN thinks it'd be kind of confusing to intersperse episdoes (episodes)
with two different commanding officers at the same time, and thus keep the two
separate, at least until the end of the season.

     (They add that someone seeing B2 mid-season year two might not know it's
a rerun, and not know what the hell's going on.)
