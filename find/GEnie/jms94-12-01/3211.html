     Re: Ivanova and Sheridan going into the Cortez upon it being pulled into
B5...this was an Earth vessel, remember, stating it's on a mission of peace,
with a cryogenic suspension chamber in use.  There was zero perceived danger.
Also, if I were the captain of a naval vessel today, and I came across an
intact sailing vessel that went missing in the 1890s, you'd have to hold a gun
at my head to KEEP me out of that ship.   People are, by nature, curious...and
this would be a fascinating puzzle to solve.
