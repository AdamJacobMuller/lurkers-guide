     Correct, "Soul Mates" is next up.  Then 5 or so reruns (second season
eps), then "Race."

     BTW, logging in from my notebook.  The controller on my old system (not
the nifty Dell at the office) just died, so I may not be on quite as regularly
for the next few days.

                                                       jms
