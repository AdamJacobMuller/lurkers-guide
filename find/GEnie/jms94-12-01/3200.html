     Just as an aside...I learned this morning that there's a good chance that
my Christmas episode of THE REAL GHOSTBUSTERS, "Xmas Marks the Spot," will be
replayed on ABC either Christmas day or eve; don't yet know if it'll be in
prime-time or morning.  Still awaiting final confirmation, but they wouldn't
call to notify me unless it was pretty solid.

                                                                jms
