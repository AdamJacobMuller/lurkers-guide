     Richard and Paul are in *different* episodes.

     Bear...not a chance.  I *love* that movie; Paul mentioned that it
continues to have a rabid cult following.  When he signed it, he wrote  "Trust
me.  Swan." in addition to his signature.  (Funny if you know the movie.)

     "We're old souls, in a new life, baby...."
