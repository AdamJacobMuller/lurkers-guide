     Hey, give me "A Christmas Story" or the George C. Scott version of "A
Christmas Carol" (the only definitive version of the story, as far as I'm
concerned) over IaWL, which has been seen to death.  Scott is the first and
only actor to show Scrooge with a sense of *humor* even in his earlier stage.
Look at it...anyone who could come up with a line like "every person walking
around with Merry Christmas on his lips should be boiled in pudding and buried
with a sprig of holly through his heart" (or words to that effect)...that's
*funny*.  It's very easy to see and portray Scrooge as just a one-dimensional
miser, and thus dehumanize him...Scott's portral makes him a PERSON, and thus
more interesting and involving and, oddly, likeable (until the end where he
goes soft on us, but hey, that's a story problem...).
