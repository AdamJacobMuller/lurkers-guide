     Thanks.  As it turns out -- I today saw the list of nominees -- B5 is the
ONLY TV-SF nominated for the Hugo.  The rest are all feature films (JP, Addams
Family, Nightmare Before Christmas, Groundhog Day).

     As for questions for Mira...we'll play it by ear, and leave it to her
discretion.

                                                                jms
