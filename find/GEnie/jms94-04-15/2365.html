     Agreed, the pilot movie was much darker...unfortunately, it was SO dark
that we actually veered into what're called "illegal blacks," that is, the
picture is too dark, and this causes problems with foreign distributers.
(This is what they tell me, and through an act of faith I have come to believe
them.)  We're still about a half-stop or full stop below what's typical.  Be
advised that many stations, when they broadcast the show, pump up the
brightness a *lot*.  They just dial it up.
