     Owning your own space ship isn't cheap, but it also isn't as expensive as
it might be.  The investment is about the same as starting up your own
business.  There's not a lot of civilian "touring cars," for lack of a better
term; better to use the liners and shuttles.  But for businesses, surveyers,
explorers, traders and the like...yeah, they're within one's grasp.  And these
sorts of ships are pretty much all run by computer.  No crew required.  Just
go from place to place.  If it's a scientific survey ship, then you'll have
some more.
