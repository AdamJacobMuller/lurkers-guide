     I was asked to keep quite about this until April 23rd, which is when the
announcement is to be made at the Nebulas, but now that it's indeed the 23rd,
and that announcement either has been made or is being made now, I'm pleased
to report that the Babylon 5 pilot movie, "The Gathering," has been nominated
for a Hugo.

     Since we're up against Jurassic Park, I think I pretty much know where
THAT award is going...but it is a tremendous honor and everyone involved with
the show is very pleased by it.

                                                                 jms
