     Jose: you are deliberately mischaracterizing the events in "Midnight."
Sinclair did not -- repeat, did NOT -- "tell Ivanova to defy Earth's orders
and deceive the council."  He set up a situation in which he would say that he
was unable to catch up with her and pass along the Senator's instructions
before he had to leave.  Her line would be that "The Commander never told me,"
and he would back this up.  (And that he would hedge the truth this way is
hardly "perfect.")

     Defying the Senator's orders would be telling them that the vote will NOT
be made as ordered.  That never happened.

     Y'know, I don't mind if folks criticize, but it would be nice if what
people criticized had actually HAPPENED...like the similar problem over in 19,
when it was stated that the line, "There's a shuttle leaving in one hour, be
on it" was made in three different episodes...when in fact it only happened in
one.

                                                                  jms
