     Jim, your thesis comes from the underlying assumption that, as in the
Trek universe, All Things Must Be Done Fairly, the government must in the end
be wise and fair and sensible.

     That ain't our universe.  That ain't even *this* universe.

     Sinclair must follow orders.  He didn't want to escort Deathwalker off
and on to Earth, those were his marching orders.  *The same marching orders
would be given to an ambassador representing Earth*.  So your career diplomat
would be in exactly the same position.  What, do you think that career
diplomats are independent agents of goodness?  They all work for SOMEone,
representing their interests.

     Earth put in the majority of the money required to build and operate B5.
They have the right, as such, to appoint a provisional governor, nad (and)
that is the function that Sinclair mainly serves.  He runs this place, AND he
is responsible for maintaining good relations with other  representatives.  He
is also on a short leash.  And in some cases, as in "By Any Means Necessary,"
other people are sent in to handle certain kinds of negotiations.

     Yes, it is a conflict of interest.  So what?  Do you think Earth cares
much about that?  Is it awkward?  Yes, of course.  It *should* put him in
moral quandries.  The Earth Government is constantly getting him into binds.
What they wanted him to do in "Deathwalker" was more or less of a dubious
nature.  But in the end, he found a fairly moral solution to the problem.
That's what he does.  He finds an honorable way out of very difficult and
morally ambiguous situations.  What you suggest is that we remove the moral
ambiguities.  Ehhh.  I find that boring as hell.

     Do the other species like it?  Of course not.  Okay, so what're they
going to do?  Boycott B5?  And let other species take advantage of all the
economic and political benefits the station provides?  Let others grow in
familiarity and form alliances that might in time turn against them?  Not a
chance.  Fair or not, it's the only game in town.

     So I don't buy your solution because I don't think it's a problem.   You
do.  That's life.  Political situations are rarely fair, or logical, or
ethical.  If politics were based on ethics this would be a MUCH better world.
But politics are generally based on who has the power, and the money, and the
guts.

                                                                 jms
