     Herb, no, I don't agree with you.  As far as we knew, Lennier was going
to vote with Sinclair and the League.  So you hold off his change of vote for
the end.  You get a few no votes, annoy the League, Sinclair raises their
hope, and then Lennier, much as he hates it, dashes that hope.  It's an arc
that way, rather than a descending staircase.
