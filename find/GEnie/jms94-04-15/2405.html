     When I developed the basic Believers story, and was looking for someone
to assign it to, David was the first person we went to.  He asked me at the
time why him...he's more generally associated with humorous stuff.  I had my
reasons.  See, lately, David adopted a young boy, about the same age as Shon.
So about halfway into the outline, David called and said, "NOW I understand."
I knew that having a child of his own now would mean that the story would be a
lot more personal.  Especially the end scene, which I knew would have to be
done *very* carefully.

     I think David did a great job, and under his guidance it turned into a
very moving episode.  And with any luck, he'll write more down the road.
