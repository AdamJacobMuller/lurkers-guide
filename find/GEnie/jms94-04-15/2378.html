     On the "predictable" argument...I can only shrug.  The kid has a 50/50
chance...he'll survive or die.  And guessing the end isn't, for me, the key;
this isn't a who-dunit; it's how our characters react on the way there, and
what it *does* to them, I think.

     And yeah, TV generally doesn't do this kind of ending.  Which is why we
did it...and our liaison at Warner Bros. deserves a lot of credit for letting
us do it.
