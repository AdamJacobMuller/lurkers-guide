     Just to clarify...the Vorlon ship destroyed only Deathwalker's ship, not
an EA vessel.  And the Vorlon ship waited until Deathwalker's ship was far
from B5, just before entering the gate, before coming out to strike.   At that
range, it couldn't miss, and at that distance, B5 couldn't react fast enough.

                                                                jms
