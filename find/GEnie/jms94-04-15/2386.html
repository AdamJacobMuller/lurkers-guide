     I was on "Murder" for about two years.  I left about the time we were
just finishing post-production on the B5 pilot movie.  I think I wrote about 8
or so episodes of the series.  A couple were Irish type stories, "The Wind
Around the Tower," and "To the Last Will I Grapple With Thee" (I was in a
contest to come up with the longest title in the history of the series), the
murder in the Psycho house "Incident In Lot 7," one or two at the university,
including "Lines of Excellence," and some others.  It was an enjoyable
experience, all things considered, and I still think highly of Angela.  I have
a great deal of respect for her; she's a complete professional.
