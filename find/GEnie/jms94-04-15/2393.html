     On the ships...when Ron was pulling together the ships for that episode,
we talked about it on the phone for a while, and I have to take the rap for
the saucers...which I still think are cool.  I said, in essence, why the hell
not?  Ron thought it was a great idea, and went and made it real.  I think if
we ever see this kind of ship again, it'll need some more work, a little more
weight and substance, some more detail, but they're okay.
