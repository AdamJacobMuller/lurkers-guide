     My copies here at the house are SVHS, and they're a *quantum* jump over
what I see over the air.  So I can only guess what more would come out on
disk.  Eagerly awaiting the day.  As for the pilot...I ordered a copy (yes,
folks, I have to pay for one just like everybody else) some time ago; still
hasn't come in yet.

                                                                   jms
