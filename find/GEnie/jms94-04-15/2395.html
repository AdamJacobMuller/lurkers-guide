     Correct, the main difference between pistols and rifles is the range, and
the number of shots you can get out before slapping in a recharge pod.  A hand
PPG can give you about 10-12 shots per charge, while a rifle nearly doubles
that.  (And yes, we have sat down and worked out a goodly part of this stuff.)

                                                                jms
