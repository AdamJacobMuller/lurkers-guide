     H.Mallette...you're reviewing things that didn't happen, or which YOU are
twisting to your OWN convenience.

     You assume the crowd meeting Sinclair could be placated.  They make it
clear, in dialogue: "You will have to kill us all."  They could not BE
placated.  Your assumption has nothing to do with what happened, or what was
said.  Maybe in the ST universe, Picard can turn on the charm and just talk
people out of things.  That doesn't happen here, not easily at any rate.  It
was turn back or kill them.  Those were the choices.

     You misstate when you say that Dr. Franklin was unable to analyze the
serum.  He states that his preliminary analysis of the serum DID confirm her
statements; this was backed up by further evidence that she was Jha'dur, that
she was impossibly younger than she should be, and that her wounds were
healing with incredible speed.  "My assumption would be that she'd invented
something that LOOKED like an antiagapic."  Yes, and your assumption would be
wrong.  All the evidence pointed to it being EXACTLY what she said it was.
Further, the agreement between the League and Sinclair was that scientists
would be on hand during the period of development to *insure* that it was what
it was supposed to be.  Or did you miss that part?  Nobody was saying to use
it now...no one.  You' are reacting to an issue that never appeared in the
show.

     The EA escort got her as far as the gate.  Then peeled away.  And then
the Vorlon ship came out.  That's what Sinclair said: "They will escort you as
far as the gate."  And even if they had stayed with her THROUGH the gate, it
would've made no difference.  Vorlon ship comes through.  Fires at
Deathwalker's ship.  EA ships fire back.  No visible effec, the cruiser shrugs
it off and goes back the way it came.  Single Starfuries wouldn't even *dent*
a Vorlon cruiser.  So same result.

     My bottom line: if you don't like the show, then don't watch the show.
But please refrain from twisting what happened due to your incorrect
assumptions, or for your own convenience in attacking something.
