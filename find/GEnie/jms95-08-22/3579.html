     We're trying to moderate the jumpgate sound a bit; it may have gotten a
bit too hot there for a while.

     As for Ivanova...remember that the core of good drama is conflict.  So
here we have a situation where a possible romantic involvement is shaping up
for her in year three.  It shouldn't be made too easy.  So you create a
situation that really hurts her deeply; she made a difficult step, got over
her distance, opened herself up, became vulnerable...and got hurt very badly
as a result.  The same thing that happened in first season, when her old flame
was discovered to be a big guy with Home Guard.

     You now have someone who's freshly hurt, who is going to be unwilling or
slow to open up again, who's now experienced every kind of relationship and
NONE of them have worked...in short, she's one exposed nerve ending, perfect
for someone now to come in who may be right, but for whom she has little time,
and is disposed not to get involved.

     Sounds a lot like my own dating history...keep them razor blades and salt
sprays a'comin.....

                                                                   jms
