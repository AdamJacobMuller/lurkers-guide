     Just dialed in here...demographics are a dirty word where I come from. 
Basically, I write the story that I would like to see as a viewer.  If my
tastes reflect that of others, folks watch; if not, not.  

     This is how I've always written, all the way back to when I began in
animation.  "This would be a cool story."  And that's the be-all and end-all
of it.  Same with everything else.  

     Back a few years ago, I was looking for a particular kind of horror
novel.  Couldn't quite find what I wanted.  So I sat down and *wrote* it,
wrote the novel I wanted to read.  Finished it, and shoved it in the closet
for, I think, about two years.  One day, my agent suggested I really should
write a novel someday.  Reluctantly, I dragged it out of the closet.  Gave it
to her.  She gave it to a NY editor, who sold it to the first editor who got
it.  It really wasn't written for anyone else but me; had it stayed in the
closet forever, it would've accomplished that task.  

     I take that approach with everything I write; if I wouldn't watch it, I
won't write it.  So, basically, my demographic is me.

                                                                       jms
