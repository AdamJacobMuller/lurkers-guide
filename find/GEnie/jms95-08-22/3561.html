     BTW, for those interested, another of my Murder, She Wrote episodes is on
next Tuesday, "Incident in Lot 7," which is kinda fun.  One of the guest
stars, Paula Prentiss, isn't exactly the way I had envisioned the role, but
overall, it's not bad.

                                                                 jms
