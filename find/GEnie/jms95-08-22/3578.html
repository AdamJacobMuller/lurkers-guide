     Yes, we'll see both the tines being repaired, and the core shuttle being
fixed, in ep 1 of year 3.  The tines are mainly to stabalize incoming cargo
ships so they can be offloaded (something we've shown there from time to time)
into the zero-g cargo bay.

     Ken: yes, showing does not mean endorsing, showing just means saying
"this is here," not to make an issue of it.  If I'm going to start endorsing
ANYbody's POV around here, it's going to be mine, and I think we all know how
dreadful THAT would be.

     Re: Kosh...we'll see him again outside his suit in "Dust to Dust," but in
a somewhat unconventional fashion....

     As for "including controversy rather than skirting it," this is more or
less the point.  The goal here is to not have our characters or our show make
*value judgments* about what our characters do, because then you're hitting
the audience over the head with the MESSAGE.  "Believers" is a good example of
that; some came away using parts of that to argue pro and anti interference in
medical situations; ditto for "Confessions" which hit squarely on BOTH sides
of the issue (no, you can't blame morality for disease...but then, we had our
characters openly requiring blood testing, which annoys many on the other side
of the issue)....my sense is that our audience is smart enough to take the
elements we present them with, and discuss them, and come to their own
conclusions and draw their own meanings from them.  It's the part of objecting
to even *presenting* the situation that seems to me a marginal position at
best.

                                                                   jms
