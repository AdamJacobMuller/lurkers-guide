     The key to the questions is that you generally have to first be able to
answer "who are you?" before you can intelligently determine "what do you
want?"  To deal right with "what do you want" before you know who you are is
destructive in almost any situation.

     We will see Lyta again.

     RE: alternate lifestyles...I said when stuff happened, we wouldn't make a
big deal out of it, it'd just be there...and I said we'd address it in our own
way, in our own time.  We've done a bit here, we'll do a bit more down the
road.  I won't give you or anyone a timetable; I'll do stuff as the integrity
of the story permits, not sooner, not later.  I will not allow this to become
a political football.  If you do nothing, folks yell at you for ignoring it;
if you do a little, they yell for not doing more; if you do more, they yell
for not doing it sooner.  Screw it.  I do what the story calls for, as the
story calls for it.
