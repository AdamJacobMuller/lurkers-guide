     Mike Cooney: not much on foreplay, are you?  

     If you pull out all your stops in the first season or two, Mike, where do
you go from there?  First time out, we saw just one shadow vessel; then we saw
two; then we saw fighters; then we saw fighters and shadow ships, three, then
four.  There's a reason for this progression, though I can't get into it now.

     If you blow everything out this early, you've got nowhere to go.  So this
is being paced logically and carefully.

     Me, I *love* foreplay.

     Changing topics for a moment....

     Episode #5, "Passing Through Gethsemane," guest stars Brad Dourif, and is
being directed by Adam Nimoy.
