     Fern's mainly done a lot of feature films, but at this hour, the only one
that comes to mind is the Naked Gun movie.  But there's been a lot more than
just that.

     Currently, we're shooting an episode with Stephen Macht as guest star,
playing Na'Far, a Narn, in "A Day in the Strife."

                                                                 jms
