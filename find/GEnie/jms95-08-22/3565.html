     Forgot to add the final irony to all this...one of the last scripts I
wrote for The Twilight Zone was entitled "Our Selena is Dying," based on a
never-produced outline by Rod Serling.  So I did the script, based on his
outline.  So the episode has a shared credit, me and Rod.  So finding that
watch has kinda special significance.

                                                                    jms
