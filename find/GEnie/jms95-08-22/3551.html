     Dan: are you having trouble getting photos *now*?  'Cause we had a very
long talk with WB PR about this, and they said it wouldn't happen anymore.  If
it is, lemme know, and I'll beat the crap outta somebody.

     As for the rest...yes, we're hitting that point where many parts of the
media simply cannot ignore us any longer.  We're here, we're not Trek, and
you're Going To Have To Deal With Us.  If for no other reason than the readers
keep asking for coverage.  Though of those you list (Mike), about half are
British publications.  We generally get much more respect,and better coverage,
there than here.

     I haven't gotten a copy of the Foundation magazine yet; hope it came out
okay, and I don't end up looking like too much of a doofus.

                                                                 jms
