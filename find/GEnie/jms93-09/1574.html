     Okay, let me throw the question back at you: what DO you do about it?
Shipping them off somewhere costs a LOT of money.  Does the station pay for
that?  Do Earth voters object to paying for free tickets for lurkers?  Do you
shove them out the airlock and casually murder the whole lot of them?  Do you
dragoon them into a slave labor deal to pay off their debts or buy their way
off the station?  Do you isolate them and keep them as much to themselves as
you can, and hope they eventually find gigs or move on?  It's a moral dilemma
based on technologies and limited budgets and resources.

                                                                   jms
