     The various characters take their own stands,which vary.  Franklin only
considers the possibility of cloning someone's personality matrix, for
instance.  And again, it depends on how you *define* soul.  The Soul Hunter
defines it not as something supernatural, but as the collection of thoughts,
personality, feelings and the very essence of the person that dies with the
body.  That definition is broad enough to encompass just about anything.  Then
you get into the more specific ideas of what a soul is.

     One person at a post production house we've used has indicated that he
has "theological problems" with working on that episode; not because it's
*against* what he believes -- he's worked on horror movies and stuff with
devils and the like -- but because it takes a point of view he doesn't much
like...in that he has to sit and defend the whole *context* of his
ideas...meaning, it's making him think.  He can just poo-poo the stuff against
what he believes, support what he does believe in...but he isn't quite sure
where this show comes down, or where it makes *him* come down.  I've had any
number of problems with people on a show before, but this is the first time
I've run into a theological problem.
