     In the teaser scene you refer to in "Midnight," you've got a couple dozen
fighters coming in alongside about 3-4 motherships (or capital ships, either
term will suffice).  We've always said that big ships can punch through and
form their own jump points.  That's how the jump gates get there in the first
place: a big ship comes through, on its own, and leaves behind a jump gate.
There's no contradiction.  One (or more) of the big ships was creating the
point of entry as it went.

                                                                 jms
