     There's one new thing you'll be seeing in the B5 series that you  didn't
see much in the pilot, and that's compositing digital CGI with live action.
There was the observation dome shot in the pilot, where you push in and see
the Lt. Cmdr, but that was about it.  We're doing a lot more in the series,
and some of it looks absolutely *stunning*.

                                                                 jms
