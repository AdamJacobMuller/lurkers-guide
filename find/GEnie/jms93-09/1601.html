     The name of the character is Maya Hernandez.  The actor's name I'll post
after I can get the cast sheet from the office so I spell it correctly.

     Catherine Sakai, played by Julie Nickson-Soul, will first appear in "The
Parliament of Dreams," which will be *around* episode 7.

     There will be some time between episodes in the B5 universe; in some
cases it's about a week, in some cases much longer, as long as we end up
covering roughly a year.

                                                                   jms
