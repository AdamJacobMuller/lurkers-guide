     Crossed with Brett.  Yes, there's a reason.  There are always reasons for
what I write, and I try to make them good ones.  In the case of "Soul Hunter,"
there's a First Contact protocol at work here, and for something like that
Sinclair moves in.  (He also loves flying these things, and will seize on any
opporunity to get in one.)  He also takes off in "Midnight," but again there's
a specific reason that he has to be there rather than someone else.
Otherwise, it's someone else who goes.   (In "Midnight," when there's word of
another kind of problem, which may affect station security, it's Garibaldi who
goes out.)

     We will also, from time to time, put Ivanova in the cockpit as head of a
fighter wing.  They're all qualified.

     Glad you liked the CGI.  We are, as you note, working *very* hard to get
the science right...and discovering that what I assumed from the start is
correct: that if you take the time to do it accurately, it doesn't limit your
possibilities, it gives you MORE possibilities, and it looks better.

                                                                  jms
