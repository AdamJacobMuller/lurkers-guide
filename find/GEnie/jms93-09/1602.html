     I don't think I said much of anything I wouldn't want to see repeated
(unlike Larry).  And Harlan's first script is "Midnight in the Sunken
Cathedral," not chapel.  I would of course urge no spoilers be placed in
public view.  Let's have some measure of surprise when the show finally does
hit.

                                                                  jms
