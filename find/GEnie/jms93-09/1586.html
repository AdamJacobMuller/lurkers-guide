     You watched B5 from a *motel room*?  How the hell did THAT happen?

     I should probably make up a credits list one of these days, it just seems
so tedious, and I dunno, uninteresting to anyone, from my POV.  If there's
really a demand for this, I'll do it, but to recite one's credits ad
infinitum....I dunno.  I'll leave it to your preference.

                                                                  jms
