     And y'know...it's absolutely in keeping with the Straczynski luck, and
the history of this show, that the year B5 wins an Emmy is the first year that
they DON'T do the recap of last night's technical awards.  Ah, well....

     BTW, there were several odd JMS/B5 connections with other aspects of the
Emmys this year.  Performers are nominated for the full season of their
work...and Angela Lansbury was nominated for the year in which I worked on the
show as writer/producer (ditto on the previous year during my tenure).  Of
course, she's nominated every year, so a hamster could work as writer
producer, that hardly counts.  One of the other technical Emmy nominations --
for music -- went to an episode of Murder, She Wrote entitled "The Wind Around
the Tower," which I wrote; set in Ireland, it was designed to open the way for
some different styles of music in the show.  Also, John Copeland, line
producer on the B5 series, was nominated for his work on the Wild West
documentary miniseries, and B5 pilot costume designer Catherine Adair was the
designer for Angela's gowns tonight.
