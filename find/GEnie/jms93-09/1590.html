     One idea for weaponry that we've temporarily shelved, but which we may
revive at some point, was using a kind of projectile weapon, which would
function more or less as follows: you throw up a line of shrapnel type devices
in the way of a ship before it can veer away (or surround it with same).  It's
a veritable cloud of small debris, and when the ship hits it, the shrapnel
basically shreds the ship, rips the skin right off it.  Some early tests look
pretty gruesome, so we're looking at some alternate avenues, or modifications.
