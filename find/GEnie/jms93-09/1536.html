     BTW, apparently there's some silly fannish thing going on...someone
called someone I know and said that there's a bunch of people getting together
so that "when Babylon 5 fails miserably, as we all know it will, and Harlan
Ellison quits, we'll all send him telegrams saying 'You knew the job was
dangerous when you took it.'"

     I look forward to disappointing them *terribly*.
