     Well, that's now also several not entirely correct things.  (Larry should
come to more story meetings.)

     The deal with Stewart isn't about money.  That part of the deal was fine.
The problem is that he also a) wants to do an album or two, and b) wants to do
some touring, which means he can't take a long-term  assignment, which a
sereis represents.  If we wanted to pay what an album and tour would bring,
that's possible, but no show can afford that.

     I hope to have an announcement on this later this week.  It's pretty much
nailed down now, but (unlike certain story editors I could name) I tend to
wait until things are official before talking about them.  Suffice to say,
it's someone whose name you may recognize from a rock and roll background.

     The "Demon" story is on the schedule.  I don't know what Larry was
talking about in that regard, unless he was dealing with the question of
Harlan's health.

     We will reveal what Kosh is a LOT sooner than year 5.  Closer to the end
of year 2.

                                                                    jms
