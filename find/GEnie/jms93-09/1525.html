     Just to clarify: we'll be delivering *finished* episodes as early as mid-
October.  That's everything, music, EFX, everything.  PTEN doesn't begin its
new "season" until January, so that's when they'll begin airing.  But we'll
have nearly a dozen or so episodes in the can when we begin airing.

                                                                jms
