     The EA fighters get generally what any ship gets: serial numbers, the
colors or signature of its "flag," and so on.  And yes, the pilot is in a more
or less standing position, though inside a chair that supports comfortably.
If you're going to be flying forward at that kind of speed, it seemed to us
that a standing mode was better for blood circulation and response than
sitting.

                                                                 jms
