     Brett: the fighter craft release mechanism does use the rotational
gravity aspect to shoot the fighters away from the station, yes.  In a really
neato looking fashion.

     Re: fighters...it would make sense that any command personnel in a
situation like this would be thoroughly checked out and qualified to fly *the
fighters which the ship carries*.  So even if they flew other kinds of
fighters, logically they would be trained on these as well prior to
assignment.  (Though for most purposes, the EA fighters are all very similar
in most respects.)

                                                                 jms
