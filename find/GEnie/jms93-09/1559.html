     If you liked that sequence, wait until you see what comes up later in
that episode...imagine 9 B5 fighters vs. about a dozen raider ships, all in
pure x-y-z axis movement, in accurate flight patterns for a zero gravity/zero
atmosphere environment.  It's dizzying to watch, but very cool.  Absolutely
unlike anything ever done for television before.

                                                                  jms
