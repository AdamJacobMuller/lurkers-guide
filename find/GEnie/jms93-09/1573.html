     It costs a pretty fair amount.  Which is one of the concepts behind the
Lurkers on B5.  Folks who save their earnings for years to come to B5 in
search of new lives...new opportunities...and when they don't find the dream
(and not everyone does), they've expended their funds, and don't have the
money for a ticket back.  So they basically work their way down into
DownBelow, sort of the homeless area.  Space travel costs MONEY.
