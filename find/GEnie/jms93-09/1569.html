     It probably won't be, unless it's quickly referenced in the quick
overview of last night's awards.   (Apparently the E! broadcast of the
technical awards is slated for 4:00 p.m. Monday here on the West Coast, so
that means it'll either be on at 1 or 4 on the East Coast.  FYI, the award to
Ron went out very early on; it was the second category, and he was the third
up in that category.  So figure about 20 minutes in.  It would've been faster,
except the DS9 crew didn't pay attention to the request to appoint one
spokesperson, and everybody on the stage took their turn.  Natch, Ron and the
rest abided by the rules.)
