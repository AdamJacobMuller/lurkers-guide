     There's variance in the fighters.  What you saw was a general fighter
Sinclair grabbed.  The actual fighter wings ARE personalized with -- for lack
of a better term -- nose art, a la WW II bombers.  Some are abstract,
Sinclair's being tiger-stripes, basically, while others are more realistic,
with very elaborate paintings.

     And there is some recline built into the seats, so they can be
comfortable (after all, we have to have actors in these things for hours at a
time, so they'd better be comfortable).

                                                                  jms
