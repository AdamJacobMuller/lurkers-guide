     Yes, Friday and 2, and Saturday there's a follow-up presentation at 4.
One note, btw: Harlan will be at the con, and will be at the Saturday
presentation.

     If you live in San Francisco, or are planning to be at the con as of
tomorrow, Wednesday, read on:

     Harlan needs someone to wear a sandwich board announcing the signing
session for the limited edition of "Mefisto in Onyx."  Apparently the ad
didn't make it into the program book.  By way of repayment (other than simply
being part of an Ellison Event, and getting to hang with Mr. E. a bit),
there's some cash involved, and a free, autographed and personalized copy of
the "MiO" book.  If you're interested, drop me a note in private mail.

                                                                    jms
