     The 5 year arc is worked out in considerable detail; 200 single spaced
pages in a triple-encrypted file.  I can't allow myself ever to even so much
as *consider* not hitting the full five years on this, so the rest of the
question I can't answer.

     CopperCon is apparently a couple weeks after ConFrancisco, and Larry
DiTillio will be there with a B5 presentation.

                                                               jms
