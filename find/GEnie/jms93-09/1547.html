     Actually, that was another error on Larry's part.  We'd gone after
McGoohan for the role of Knight One in "And the Sky Full of Stars," after we
had to reschedule Walter.  He read the script, loved the script, and wanted to
do the episode.  (Which is *very* hard, he's very choosy about what scripts he
does, and we were delighted.)  Alas, we learned that at  the time we would be
shooting, he was slated to be out of the country on a gig that couldn't be
changed.  So that, as they say, is that.

     At this point, we've signed Christopher Neame for that role, with Judson
Scott as the other Knight character in the episode.

     (Btw, at this point, McGoohan's main work is as a director on the Columbo
movies.)
