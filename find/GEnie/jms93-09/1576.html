     Scenario Number One: sending the Lurkers back to Earth.  Comes a call
from Earth Central: "Hell, no, you're NOT shipping them back here, we're
overcrowded enough as it is, we will NOT give you permission to send them back
here."

     Scenario Number Two: turning them over to their representatives on B5.
G'Kar: "Thank you very much for bringing this to my attention, Commander, I'll
have him sent back at once."  Beat.  The commander leaves.

     G'Kar: "Get OUT of here and don't come back!  I don't have time to deal
with the likes of you, we're NOT paying to send you back to Homeworld, just
get out!"

                                                                    jms
