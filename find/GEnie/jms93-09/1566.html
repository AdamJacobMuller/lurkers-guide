     Boy, you go nuts trying to do good EFX, and then people get worried about
"effects for effects sake."  (Said complaint on my end being only half
hearted, and with some humor.)  (I'm sorry, but I'm constitutionally incapable
of doing those little smiley glyphs.)

     Trust me, the story *always* comes first.  The EFX are always and only in
the service of the story.

     Yes, the ship was a soul hunter vessel (damaged), and the pilot was
Sinclair.  About the starfield...the funny thing is, the other day I was
watching CNN and they showed a starfield shot from aboard the shuttle, looking
out at only what the eye can see.  And y'know what?  It looked EXACTLY like
the line-of-sight rendering Ron did for our starfield, and what it looksout
the observation dome window.

                                                                      jms
