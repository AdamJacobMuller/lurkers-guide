     In no particular order:

     Who's right, the soul hunter or the minbari?  Yes.

     It was the discussion early on here about composers, in which Chris
Franke's name was mentioned, that bumped him to the top of our list and helped
motivate us to take a look.  One more way the interaction has been positive.

     And yes, he will be doing the entire season.  And composing a new B5
theme.  (I keep suggesting something along the lines of "Bali High" from
"South Pacific."  They keep hitting me with week old halibut.   "Babylonnnnnnn
FiiiiiiIIIIve.....")

     January 24, eh?  Good.  Glad to hear it.  (Producers are always the last
to know.)

     Finally...yes, there are leftover clothes.  Why not?  There are in real
life.  What you'll often see Sinclair wearing, when he's off duty in his
quarters, is an old scruffy sweatshirt/sweater from the EA flight school.

                                                               jms
