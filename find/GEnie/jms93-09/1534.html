     At risk of rehashing this one more time, what's missing from the pilot is
25 minutes of additional material that further fleshed out the characters.

     Each of the characters is being solidly rounded out in the series,
showing multiple sides to each character.  All I can say is that I think
you'll like what we're doing.  On the topic of music, I'll have more to say in
a few days or so.

     Still bushed from the convention, and have leapt fully back into the
show, so this'll be brief.  But it was a great time, and I'm glad that the
clips went over so well.

                                                                  jms
