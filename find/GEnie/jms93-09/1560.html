     The fighters are built on a cross-wing structure (four wings), but very
different from either X-wing or tie fighters.  The four wings have fore, aft,
top, bottom and side thrusters, so that they can move in any direction...they
can fly left to right, turn backwards, and continue to fly left to right,
flying backwards, and thus fire right to left. They're perfectly designed for
zero-g environments.
