     Let me just stick my neck out a little here...though I know I won't be
sticking it out very far, having seen what I've just seen.

     I've always been *very* careful in what I say, to avoid over-hyping
anything, or to make promises I can't fulfill.  That's why I ask, when I go to
conventions, "Did I keep my promise?"

     Here's a promise for you.  Which I make without hesitation.

     "And the Sky Full of Stars" is absolutely unlike anything ever produced
before for television.  It is, so far, the high-water mark of the season.
Directorially, and in terms of the visual effects, the CGI, the performances,
(the writing, one hopes)...right across the board, it's a stunner.  And
just...I can't convey this enough...*different*.  It just takes TV science
fiction and yanks it to a whole other level of complexity.

     Knowing that I'll eventually be hitting conventions after this show airs,
at which time I'll get reactions, I say that without hesitation.  I think you
will find this promise kept.

                                                             jms
