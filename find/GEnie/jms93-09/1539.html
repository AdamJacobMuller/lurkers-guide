     Better now, having gotten a little sleep (albeit in the office, at
lunch).  As for some people gleefully hoping for failure...I think in part
it's the Titanic syndrome of people loving big disasters.  Also, if you look
at most SF shows produced in the U.S., there haven't been that many long-lived
success stories.  And a LOT of bombs.  So it comes down to a conditioned
reflex: it won't last, or it'll be a bomb, or both.  They just naturally
assume this will be the case.

     Having now seen final cuts on a number of episodes, I look forward to
disappointing them.

                                                                jms
