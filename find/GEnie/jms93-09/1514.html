     The problem, of course, with DeVito or Lloyd or (as some suggested) Mel
Gibson or others it that their salaries would be, individually, equal to our
entire production budget for 3-4 episodes.  Which means we'd have to shoot
only 18 rather than 22.

     As for a production report...things are going swimmingly.  Today we
started getting dailies on our first day of shooting on "And the Sky Full of
Stars," which deals with the Battle of the Line.  This is not going to look
like your conventional episode of television.  We've brought in equipment that
you don't normally see on a television set, certain kinds of cranes and lenses
and lighting packages that will give this particular episode a very strange,
almost surreal look.  It's quite remarkable.

     And Ron's pushing the envelope on the CGI...compositing some live action
stuff with CGI that'll blow your TV out.

     It's going *well*.

                                                                  jms
