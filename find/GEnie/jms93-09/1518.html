     I'm afraid I wasn't much impressed with the SQ CGI.  You really couldn't
SEE anything, there were no shadows, I still don't really know what the SQ
looks like...what Ron's doing is years beyond what you saw.

     Speaking of which, I was with Ron and the Foundation crew tonight at the
technical Emmys presentation, where we picked up the visual EFX award for his
work on B5.  (In this category, more than one show can win, so we got one,
Lucas' Indiana Jones series got one,and DS9 got one.  Lucas was quite
intrigued by the B5 footage on the screens, as I noted from my table, which
was next to his.)  It's quite rewarding, our first time out of the door, to be
in that company.

     It's my *understanding* that the E! channel will show the technical emmys
on Monday, but that's not confirmed.

                                                                  jms
