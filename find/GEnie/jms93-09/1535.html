     Frankly, I can't imagine that other show *ever* doing a show about soul
stealing.  Re: the "hard-SF" note, I noted earlier that there are some hard SF
aspects to the show, and some elements that could best be described as science
fantasy...but in those cases, as with "Soul Hunter," we leave it ambiguous: is
he actually doing what he says he's doing, or basically encoding a simulation
of someone's brain wave patterns to create a duplicate of someone's memories
and personality?

     I have to say I'm a little dismayed at the *detail* of the spoilers
given; I'd imagined that there would be some description of what was seen, but
not in this exhaustive detail.  Which is all I'll say about it; you pays your
money and you takes your chances.

     I'm pretty much running on fumes right now, between running from editing
room to stage to keyboard to production meeting.  I think I also picked up a
slight trace of the creeping crud, which I'm trying to fight, but with the
hectic schedule, that's hard.

     I've now seen the completed CGI EFX from "Midnight," which has some
considerable space fight stuff, and it's simply the most amazing thing I've
ever seen done for television.  Ron has so far exceeded what's in the pilot
that I can't even begin to describe it to you.

     Late next week we begin shooting "And the Sky Full of Stars," which is
going to be a VERY surreal, unusual episode, not just story wise, but from a
directorial standpoint as well.  Very stylistic.  (Janet Greek, of Northern
Exposure, is directing.)  It's really one of those "kick over the table"
episodes.
