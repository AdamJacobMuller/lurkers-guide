     There will be merchandising, but we're just not going to let it be what
drives the show.  And it really isn't set up to be a theatrical project.  As
for being a show with integrity, there's plenty of them out there.  "Picket
Fences" is probably the best example of that, just offhand.  How we're doing
what we're doing...is a combination of things: the right technology at the
right time, the right people, the right stories, and the right environment.
Sometimes you catch lightning in a bottle, and sometimes you catch fireflies.
That this show proceeds from a definite, personal vision, and is not the
product of a committee, likely has a great deal to do with it.

     Though the reaction to what we're doing within the studio and network
arenas has been very positive and extremely supportive, I don't think anyone --
even, to some degree, those of us doing the show -- *really* understood what
we had until we finished "Sky."  This episode has sent ripples all OVER the
place.  I can honestly say it's not like any other television episode you've
seen...people will be dissecting this one for a long, LONG time after it airs.

     The other episodes we've made are all good..."Midnight," "Believers,"
"Soul Hunter"...there's not a dud in the bag so far.  But with "Sky" we have
created something quite amazing.  I still haven't seen a final cut on this
episode, but if it's in keeping with the way it's falling together so
far...when they add up the balance at the end of my life, I think that "Sky"
will be remembered.  I know this sounds awfully overblown, and I'm not really
comfortable talking about anything like this, but jeezus....

     Ladies and gentlemen, it's a corker.  Honest to god, I think we've just
made a little history.
