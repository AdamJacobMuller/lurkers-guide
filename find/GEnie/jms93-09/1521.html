     We are shooting in 16:9 aspect ratio, cutting it down to normal TV aspect
ratio for its initial broadcasts.  When a) the laserdisks are in time
released, and b) when HDTV becomes more of a standard, the full letterboxed
aspect ratio will be available.

                                                                     jms
