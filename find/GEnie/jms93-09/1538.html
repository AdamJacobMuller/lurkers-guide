     Agreed; I wouldn't expect to see anything significant in TV Guide for a
while yet; better that way, so it won't get lost in the fall preview.

     Re: the pilot...I've hashed and rehashed this, and the bottom line is to
see what we do in the series and judge the series by the series.  The DS9
pilot had to explain very little that wasn't specific to the plotline: you
already knew what a bajorran was, what a wormhole was, what the Federation
was, what the cardassians were, on and on and on.  Because they didn't have to
introduce any of that, they could spend time on other character moments.

     We didn't have that luxury in the pilot.  We had to do what, in essence,
ST has done over 25 years: establish our universe, painting it in broad
strokes, as broad're done with that aspect.  And now we can do our character-
based stories.  Which is exactly what we're doing.

                                                                  jms
