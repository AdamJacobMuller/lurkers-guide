     I'd rather not, frankly.  I'm quite happy with television for B5.

     I'm being very careful not to let B5 turn into a *franchise*.  It's a
story, created in X-parts, for television.  This thing will turn into an
industry over my dead body.  The most that the framework will permit is a 2-
hour TV movie that caps year 5.  That's it.

                                                                  jms
