      Okay, because they've been requested (I got another couple of
 notes in email asking for this), here's a quick rundown on my prior
 work.  This isn't everything...this is about half of the body of
 work...but this is probably the more interesting stuff.

 of print, mainly because I'm about 2 years behind delivering the
 new edition, THE (EVEN MORE!) COMPLETE BOOK OF SCRIPTWRITING.

 adaptation of my TZ3 episodes.  Bantam.

  ...SHORT STORIES

 "A Last Testament for Nick and the Trooper" Shadows 6 anthology.
 "Say Hello, Mister Quigley," Pulphouse Magazine, and the Midnight

  ...ARTICLES/JOURNALISM

 investigative articles and others -- appearing in PENTHOUSE, VIDEO

 Correspondent), THE LOS ANGELES HERALD EXAMINER (ditto), TIME, INC.
 (where I was on staff at various points), SAN DIEGO MAGAZINE, THE
 SAN DIEGO and LOS ANGELES READER(s), WRITER'S DIGEST (10 years worth
 of columns and articles as a Contributing Editor), and others that
 I've forgotten and am too lazy to dig out.

  ...RADIO

 Diego, for about 2-3 years.

 Host, HOUR 25, a weekly SF talk show in L.A. for 5 years.

 Radio drama writer for ALIEN WORLDS, MUTUAL RADIO THEATER, and

  ...THEATER

 length play which played at the Marquis Public Theater in San
 Diego for 20 weeks.  Includes many one-act plays.  One play

 you what it is.)

  ...COMICS

 Wrote other feature film screenplays for DIC and London Films.

      Anyway, those are the highlights.  I've left out a lot of stuff, and
 subsets of stuff (like the prime-time TRGB's special, for which I cowrote
 a couple of songs with Brian O'Neal of the Busboys, and other song
 related stuff...I've had about half a dozen songs get out there, plus one
 on record), but those are the main items.

                                                                   jms
