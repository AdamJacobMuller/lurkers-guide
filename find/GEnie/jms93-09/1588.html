     Not at this time, no.  It was a very nifty idea, but it's taken so long
to get off the ground that in the interim, somebody ate our lunch.   A similar-
concept movie is now in production.  (Here's a difference when it comes to
this particular problem.  The other studio developing this other movie had no
access to our material, which was developed quietly in house with Ivan.  It's
a pure example of simultaneous creation.  From time to time, these things
happen.)

     Anyway, the concept was this: a present-day cop is accidentally quick
frozen in a cryogenics lab during a shoot out.  He remains in suspended
animation for a hundred years and change.  He's revived in a world in which
crime is virtually non-existent, because it's been programmed out of people
through genetic alterations and early conditioning.  There's still a police
force, of sorts, but mainly serve tickets for safety violations and other non-
criminal offenses.

     Just one problem: along comes one man on whom the programming has
glitched, failed.  And he's been committing murders.  They've hushed it up,
but gradually our character finds out, and goes after the guy, who is totally
deranged, sees it as his mission to keep the darkness alive.  He commits his
murders in the same style as the famous murderers of the past (a la Jack the
Ripper, for instance).  It comes down to a face-off between these two
characters.

     It had a dramatic through-line, but a lot of humor as well, as the cop
tries to fit into this new world.
