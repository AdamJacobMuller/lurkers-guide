     Of course, your solution omits two factors: 1) not all lurkers are human,
and 2) not all human lurkers are from Earth.  Do you pay to send hundreds of
people or more back, one at a time, on various high-priced transports which
are already backed up on reservations, to a dozen or more different
worlds...some of which may not WANT them back?  Do you divert limited B5
resources to track each lurker, find out his/her/its homeworld, make
arrangements with people who may not WANT to make arrangements (at home, and
the people lurking)...the paperwork and details would be simply immense.
