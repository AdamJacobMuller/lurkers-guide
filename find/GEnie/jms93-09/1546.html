     Brett: this isn't a case of jack-of-all-trades.  Garibaldi *has* to be a
qualified fighter pilot as head of security of a *space station* where
problems can come up in the space surrounding the station.  Also, as mentioned
here before (I think) and certainly in one of our scripts, during the period
between Garibaldi's last security job, and now, when eh (he) couldn't get a
job as security chief, he was a pilot, running transport shuttles on a couple
of ice mining operations.  (It was not a good period for him.)  Nothing is
done arbitrarily with these characters.   All three of our main EA characters -
- Sinclair, Garibaldi and Ivanova -- are qualified fighter and transport
pilots.  Having Talia suddenly going off in one of these would be absolutely
wrong, and a case of what you describe.
