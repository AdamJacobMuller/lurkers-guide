     Of course, these aren't shuttle mission specialists.

     Carlos: it's hard to get McGoohan.  The script has to be just *so*.
"Sky" was that way, probably one of the most unusual scripts I've ever
written, and one I knew would get him.  Later...we'll see.  But we'll
definitely keep trying.

     Re: the end of the 5th year...I've noted before that there is a thread
raised during the B5 run that could be extended into its own series.  But it
wouldn't be B5.  The story of Babylon 5 ends at the end of the fifth year,
regardless.

     BTW, since as mentioned Stewart Copeland is going to be off touring and
doing an album and other stuff, we've had to lock down someone else as our
resident composer.  Someone suggested here numerous times has now been
confirmed: Christopher Franke, of Tangerine Dream, who has done the
soundtracks for such projects as Thief, Angel Falls, Universal Soldier,
Tommyknockers and others.  In addition to being a solid percussion man and a
great musician, he's a real techie, up on the latest technologies involving
music and sound, and will be able to give B5 a VERY unique sound.
