     Rich, you worked with Meatloaf, eh?  Cool.  I've always enjoyed his work,
on camera and on records, and am only dismayed that there's so little of it
generally available.  (I found more of it in London than I've seen here in the
states.)  His songs have a very sharp wit to them that's lacking in a lot of
other stuff.  ("I want you...I need you...but there ain't no way I'm ever
gonna love you...But don't feel sad...'cause two out of three ain't bad.")

     I have very weird, very eccentric and eclectic tastes in music.  In
addition to Meatloaf, I'm big on Leon Redbone, Indigo Girls, Enya, I'm
starting to like Digable Planets...classical, jazz, big band, hard rock,
celtic, blues, just about anything *except* country, which I couldn't warm up
to even if I were cremated in a crate of Garth Brooks albums.

                                                               jms
