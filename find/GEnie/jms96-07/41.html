     The videos were the same, in the case of "Requiem," but the
projection system wasn't really up to snuff.

     Now, I toss out a philosophical question for general
consideration.

     When they first showed "Requiem," I was watching from the back,
as is my wont.  I always try to make sure *everybody* can see and hear 
stuff as well as conceivable.  The lights were on low in the middle of 
the room, which washed out about 60% of the video; there were whole 
sections where you couldn't see squat.

     I was very bugged about this, and when I went to the stage, and
set up things to show, I said bring the lights down *all the way*.  One
person with the con said "We can't do that."  This seemed remarkable to 
me, as I understood that most electrical devices had on and off switches.  
So I cupped the mike and indicated that if the lights didn't go down I'd 
shoot them out.  They went down.

     The second time we went dark, I found out what was going on sub
rosa.  There were, I think, 3 or 5 deaf people in the front of the room, 
and had someone signing for them to tell them what was being said on the
clips.  The person doing the signing was very upset with me, to say the 
least.

     So here's the dilemma: you keep the lights up, and 2,400 people
can't SEE the screens.  If you lower the lights, they can, but the 3-5 
people with hearing problems can't hear what's being said.

     The logical solution, I believe, was what I did: the lights go
down, on the theory that the 2,400 outnumber the 3-5.  But at the same 
time, I'm sensitive to the problem.  I know that the signer was 
upset...but at the same time, I figure, if you knew you were going to be 
signing in a room where a SCREENING was going on, which therefore would 
get dark, you'd bring a low-level light or flashlight for those periods.

     Comments?  Discussions?

     I think I made the right decision...but it's a tough call, y'know?

                                                                   jms
