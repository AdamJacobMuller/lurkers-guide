     Vampyr: Zelazny collected 500 rejection slips before he sold
anything, so you've got at least 499 more to go before you're entitled to 
get depressed.

     And yes, the piece can be reprinted, as can anything I write
here.

     I'd hoped not to generally have this known...but no, I don't
drive.   I have a bit of a proble with depth perception that only comes 
into play really in any significant way when I'm behind the wheel of a car.
Translation: I hit things, and they frown on that.  So for the good of the
Commonweal, I stay off the roads.

     So I don't know who drove off at LosCon, but it weren't me.

                                                                jms
