     I think part of the disagreement here comes over how you define
what a STORY is.  A story is the connotation of consequences, and 
context, as opposed to a PLOT, which is the series of events in which the 
story takes place, A, B, C, D.  "The king died, and then the queen died" 
is a basic plot.  "The king died, and then the queen died of grief" is a 
story.

     I preface this by saying I haven't seen ID4 yet, so take what
follows cum granus salus, but....

     As I understand it, ID4 is an incident/plot driven movie.  Bad
aliens come to Earth.  Bad aliens smash.  Good humans smash back.  Good
humans win.  The aliens are there to shoot and be shot at, and we don't 
really know much about who they are, where they come from, their 
cosmology, any of that.  It's a series of incidents.

     With Star Wars, you got the sense of things happening outside the
plot, and you got the sense of context and consequences.  It delved into
matters of belief, the use of the Force, the Zen notion of letting go of 
the conscious self.  It carried with it a sense of history, the notion 
that there had been prior wars, and the whole history of the Jedi 
Knights, which carried with it a sense of mystery and wonder.  There was 
a fairly well realized political framework, with Imperials and rebels and 
other planets that chose not to get involved.  You got the sense that the 
events in the story came from somewhere, and would lead to something.

     There's not much question that Star Wars contains more actual
story than ID4.  Which isn't the same thing as saying that one is 
*better* than the other.  That's a mug's game, because whatever's better 
for us is a purely subjective decision.  But one can point to the two 
movies and say, with a fair amount of objectivity, which one contains 
*more* story than the other, which involved the most creativity and 
world-building.

     Just to try and clarify the argument a little....
