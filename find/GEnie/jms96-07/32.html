     I've said it before, I'll say it again: this show was born under
a black star.

     Starting from the debut of the pilot in New York, where we were
literally blown off the air by the World Trade Center blast, which took out
WWOR's antenna, until now, anything that can go wrong, does.

     After 3 years, we're finally, FINALLY, going to get a good sized
article in TV Guide (July 27th) as part of their SF round up.  They sent a
photo crew out to do the shoot.  Very difficult and elaborate, cast came 
in on breaks and cut short time away to do it.  

     So today WB calls to say that after Federal Expressing the
original negatives, transparencies, everything, to NY in time for the 
article, the truck carrying the art was hijacked at gunpoint, and 
everything inside went with it.  So now it's too late to redo the shoot, 
and they'll have to go with older art provided by WB.

     We can't catch a break on this show....

                                                                   jms
