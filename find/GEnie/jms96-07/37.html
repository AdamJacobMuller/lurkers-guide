     So given that all of season 3 has only one author, given that you
can easily define a season (apparently there was some confusion about what
a season is) as Year 3, episodes 301-322, given that this year they're
MUCH more directly linked as one dramatic unit...what d'you think the 
odds would be of getting all of season 3 of B5 considered as one dramatic 
unit for Hugo consideration next season?

     (Heck, we gotta compete with ID4 *somehow*....)
