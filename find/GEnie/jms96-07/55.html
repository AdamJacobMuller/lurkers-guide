reported, and he's been very open in talking about them.

     And yes, definitely know that Rod's no longer with us, I was just
playing into the TZ sensibility for a moment.  (While on TZ3 I did a
posthumous collaboration with Serling, taking his outline for "Our Selena 
Is Dying" and turning it into a full episode of the show.)
