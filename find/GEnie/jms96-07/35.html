     Allen: yes, that's a correct statement.

     Trys: why can't they change us?  Situation is this: the UK
doesn't have ratings periods.  The US does.  They check their ratings all 
the time, and determine their rates for advertising, and don't generally 
have rerun periods.  So they play straight through.

     If WB plays the shows in July, August, or September, those aren't
sweeps periods.  Also, those months are when TV viewership figures (they 
call them HUTs, Households Using Television) are at their lowest, because 
people are away from home, on vacation, at the beach, whatever.  The 
November sweeps are *crucial* to keeping a show on the air.  So WB wants 
to air the final 5 in October, to ramp up the ratings in November, for 
that reason.  (It often takes weeks for people not online to discover 
there ARE new episodes on.)  

     If they play us out of sweeps, we're a less valuable commodity to
the stations, and thus it's more likely we'd get canceled.  Pick your
poison.
