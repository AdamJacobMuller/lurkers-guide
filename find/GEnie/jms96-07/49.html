     The driving *can* be done...but from my perspective, knowing me,
not as safely as I feel should be the case.  Unless I'm 100% confident of my
ability, I won't get behind the wheel of a car and risk hurting 
someone.   It's just not something I can do with a clear conscience.

                                                                   jms
