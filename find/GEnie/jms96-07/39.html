     I was in college when Star Wars hit, first year or so, I think,
and had somehow managed to utterly and completely miss ALL of the hype 
and PR about the movie *for the entire duration of its run*.  (I was, by 
turns, studying heavily, writing heavily and dating heavily.)  I finally 
wandered in to see it on the last day of a screening run at a small 
theater in Chula Vista, about the last place on earth still playing it by 
that late date.  Sat down to watch it, figuring it'd be another cheesy 
awful film like the (I think) Star Invasion movie I'd seen just before, 
with Robert Vaughn, I think, and Christopher Lee....

     No expectations, no knowledge.  Tabula rasa.

     Two or three other people in the theater as it went dark.

     That first shot pinned my ears to the back of the room and never
left.
