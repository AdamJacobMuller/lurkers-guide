      It's "arc," as story arc, he kinda misunderstood.

      I'm rather conflicted about the article...on one hand, it's a
positive article, and one should be properly thankful for that.  On the 
other, I'd thought it'd be about the show, and the cast (I wasn't even in 
the photo shoot, which is standard, so again I figured it was about the 
show per se), and instead it's mainly jms stuff, which I'm kinda so-so 
about.  And on the third hand (I have a third hand now), it feels like he 
was looking for some kind of angle on the story, found this one -- that 
we are ABOUT something -- and kinda ran it into the ground.  

     It seems these days that if you care about something, if you want
to make a statement, or believe in your work, somehow that's passe, and 
it's trendy to poke fun at passion.  The trouble with cynicism is that it 
tends to devolve into contempt, and these are cynical times.

     So I dunno...good article, in most ways, others...just kinda sets
my teeth on edge.  But again, this is the first time they've really
acknowledged us, so I have no complaints.  I'm happy they did it.
