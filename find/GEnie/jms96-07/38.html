     But is it really an exception?  You have two books as potential
nominees. One is 100,000 words long, the other is a huge 300,000 word 
potboiler. But they're both written by one author, so they're both 
eligible.  If a two-part episode can be considered a dramatic unit 
because it has one author, and a single episode can be considered because 
it has one author, then why not a 22- parter with only one author?  Just 
because the unit has more pages shouldn't mitigate against it any more 
than the 300,000 word novel should be disqualified.

     If you stop and think about it dispassionately for a moment, the
exception would be in NOT allowing a whole one-author season be
nominated.  The committee has already allowed the notion of multiple-part 
nominees by accepting two-parters.  You've crossed the one-episode barrier
already.  So logically if you've accepted that, why suddenly change it to 
just one episode?


     Conceivably, I could take all 22 scripts, put a huge binder on
it, and slap a cover page on it reading SEASON THREE, WRITTEN BY J. MICHAEL
committee and say, "Here, here's one dramatic unit."  

     On one level, it's really kind of an intellectual exercise; I
like to feather around the rules and see what things mean when little things
get changed, and what the *sense* of the rule is vs. how it's applied
sometimes.
