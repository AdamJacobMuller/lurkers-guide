     Mike: the problem is we're telling different stories.  What makes
it interesting for me is that Sheridan *isn't* prepared, Kosh *didn't*
finish his training.  It isn't nice and tidy.  And to stop and explain 
the dream in "Interludes" would've meant taking, oh, about 3-5 minutes 
OUT of that episode, and it's very tight as it is.  And it would've just 
been a case of, "Here, here's this bit of exposition relating to 
something you've seen before."

     No, the dream *does* get explained...and it gets explained *this
season*, in the course of the final five.  In detail.  But at the right 
time, and in the right place.  To have explained it sooner wouldn't work, 
it has to come at the right moment, with the last bits of information our 
characters need to *use* that interpretation.

                                                                   jms
