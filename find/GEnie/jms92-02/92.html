     Eric: we have to find you a hobby....

     Well, boys and girls, Today I Yam a Man.  I yanked out the power supply
on the old trusty Northgate all by my own self, put in the new one, replugged
the ten zillion wires...and it's up and running.  Didn't even have to bug the
guys at Northgate to do it via phone.

     And so, with no further ado, a list of some of the additional TV stations
that've signed on to carry the B5 movie, and subsequently, Mojo willing and
the crick don't rise, the series:

     WPHL Philadelphia; WSBK Boston; WXON Detroit; WATL Atlanta; WSTW Seattle;
KDVR Denver; WOFL Orlando; WTTV Indianapolis; and WVTV Milwaukee.   The only
NY station that we have to date, that I *know* of, at least  (meaning they
might've added another and not told me yet) is WWOR.

     More as I get the completed lists.

     Meanwhile...I'M BACK ON LINE...and woe to the wicked!

                                                                 jms
