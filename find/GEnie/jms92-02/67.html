     nic:

     Thank you.

     You have expressed your opinion.  I have expressed mine.  I will continue
to express my opinion, and you will continue to express your opinion.  If it
makes you uncomfortable, you may want to Per this topic.   This is after all a
matter of some importance to me, and you have no conception of the trauma
visited upon me by the events subsequent to December 1992.  Alas, I am not a
vulcan, and can feel, and those feelings come out through this topic, which
is, in a way, an ongoing letter or conversation about what's happening right
now with the B5 topic.

     If you don't like it, that's unfortunate, but there's nothing I can do
about that short of restricting my beliefs, and being less then honest in my
postings here, and I won't do that.  (And by the way...if B5 is on a lineal
descent from TNG, then TNG is on a lineal descent from FORBIDDEN PLANET.  And
just FYI, the genesis in my notes for B5 extends to 1986 and 1987, *before*
TNG went on the air.)  Your estimation of the value of my work -- worth a
nickel or otherwise -- is interesting but ultimately irrelevant.

     Apparently you are solidly in TNG's camp.  That is fine, and good, and I
have no quarrel with that.  SF television needs every possible support in
order to survive.  That you may not want to hear something you don't like is
rather beyond my control; life is full of things we don't like to or want to
hear.  Your statement that what's been said here is only "inflammatory BS" is,
in my view, insulting.  Something that I don't want to hear...because I know
the situation from the inside.  You do not.   Period.

     If being a TNG fan means that you must attack people, then that is most
unfortunate...since the very philosophy of IDIC means Infinite Diversity in
Infinite Combinations.

     That includes the things you don't want to hear.

                                                                  jms
