     There's some talk of novelizing the V 2-hour miniseries script, and
there's a leading SF writer interested in the job, but right now it's ONLY
talk, and I can't comment further.  As for cons in the northeast, yes, there
are some plans for that, but nothing yet concrete enough to announce here.
Will advise.

                                                                     jms
