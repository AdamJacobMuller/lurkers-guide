     Haven't checked out that keyboard yet, but may look into it.

     Definitely meant original articles, not wire-copy relays.  If you find
one, drop me a note in E-mail and I'll send along the address.  I'd post it
here, but the address will vary depending on where I can be reached at any
given time.

     As for the computer...it's a custom job and will arrive already set up,
so there won't be nearly the same level of tinkering going on, though there
will be some of that inevitably.

     Looks like I've definitely been blindsided by the flu.  Usually I'm
pretty immune, but the workload recently, and not much sleep, has probably cut
down the defenses.  Taking it easy today, just doing the B5 revisions a little
at a time (meaning cuts and trims and the like) in preparation for delivery
tomorrow.

     Hmmm....I began this message with something specific in mind that I
wanted to mention...and it just fell out of my head and rolled under the desk.
Must be time for sudafed....
