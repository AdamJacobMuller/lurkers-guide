     Expect fewer posts from me over the next few days or so...I have to
finish the current draft of "The Gathering" by Friday (Monday latest) so we
can start serious prep.  And just FYI...watch for news items next week,
between Wednesday and Friday.  There's going to be a big press conference in
NY with the Big Guns from the studio and the new network.  Don't know at this
point if I'll be there or not, it depends on my time here and imminent
deadlines.  Things are starting to heat up.

                                                                  jms
