     Just a reminder to those in the L.A. area...I'll be doing a B5
presentation at Gallifrey 3 at the L.A.X. Hilton from 1-2:30 in Pacific
Ballroom B on Saturady afternoon the 22nd.  Should start hitting the out-of-
state cons in March or thereabouts.

                                                               jms
