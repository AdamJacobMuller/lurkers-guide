     Finished with the final cuts/revisions.  Hah!  Done!

     To answer Drumhead's question above...here is our Official Status:   We
*do* have a go on the series, contingent upon only one thing: bringing the 2-
hour movie in on budget.  The plan was to approve 3 series for the consortium.
TIME TRAX and the new KUNG FU, being more easily grasped and not as EFX
oriented, were given Go's for series.  When we showed them what we had in
mind, they just didn't believe that we could do it.  My philosophy has always
been the same: let me put my money where my mouth is.  We'll do the movie, and
prove our point.  When that's done, we get the full pickup.

     The ratings, it turns out, aren't even that important since, because it's
a new consortium, they know that EVERYTHING they put on is going to be low-
rated, just as Fox was in the beginning.  As one exec put it, "You have a Go
for series if you're on budget and in focus."

     We can do both.

     Which is why Warners has decided (as will be announced formally next
week) to make BABYLON 5 their *flagship* program, the first program to be
broadcast via the consortium.  B5, "The Gathering," will air late  November
(the 17th), months ahead of everything else.  In a meeting at Warners Friday
afternoon, plans are already being put into effect regarding locking down the
cast for the series, pattern budgets, and other things that you don't even
BEGIN to consider until you're approved for series.

     Are we *officially* approved for the movie?  Yes.  Are we *unofficially*
approved for the series?  Yes.  It's a question of what you can announce,
when, and our showing what we can do.  BABYLON 5 was the *only* program that
every single member station in the consortium was able to agree that they
wanted as a series, the other two coming with some dissension.

     There will be a series.  Count on it.

     Which is why all the WB publicity material does not describe "The
Gathering" as a pilot, rather as a "debut."  The difference is substantial.

                                                                jms
