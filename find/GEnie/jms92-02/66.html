     Quick afterthought...considerable difference, isn't there, in the
discussion *here*, as opposed to the DS9 topic?

     Personally, I find it *very* rewarding.

     Oh, and I forgot one thing about Londo.  He has a wife, his third,
actually, on Centauri Prime, and seven kids.   And he would sooner hurl
himself into the sun than go anywhere near ANY of them.

                                                                 jms
    And then on the other hand, sometimes the BIGGEST surprises require the
most in planning...Hiroshima, Pearl Harbor and Normandy Beach being good
examples....

                                                             jms
