     Well, the big news took several forms, and I suppose I should've
clarified that the news was more news to folks not on this system.  In large
part, it referred to the big conference this week in NYC held to formally
announce that B5 and other Warners/Consortium projects are now going into full-
fledged production, and to formally announce the air date of B5 "The
Gathering," of November 17th.  (There's also some growing pressure to get the
series to follow up and running a little quicker than we'd
anticipated...mainly because it becomes problematic to hold actors for too
long on option.)

     Good thought on the guns/energy weapons.  I want weapons of that sort to
have a REALLY lethal look and sound and feel.  I liked the heft of the guns in
ALIENS, for instance.  I'm tentatively calling the guns PPGs, for Phased
Plasma Guns, but that may change.  Nasty suckers, but you have to be careful,
since you're in an enclosed space.

      Power supply on my current computer at home blew last night, so I have
to get another one, and that puts me back on some stuff.  (Logging on via
another computer at work.)  Pain in the butt.  Ah, well.
