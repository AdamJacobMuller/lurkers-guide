     No, Arne, that was my evil twin Sparky.

     Mike: yes, it *is* a new network, like Fox, so you're now officially very
surprised.  The thing will go on line, as did Fox, with one night of NEW
programs per week...in this case, Tuesday nights.  The plan then is to add one
new night per year, again as Fox did.  This means that programs will air at
the same times across the country, same as Fox.

                                                                  jms
