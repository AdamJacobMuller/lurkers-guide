     Any station can potentially carry B5.  Some of those who have signed are,
in fact, part of the Fox network.  The lines between networks and  syndication
are growing blurrier by the day.

     Gave the B5 presentation today to a modest group at Gallifrey Three
convention here in town.  Went pretty well.  My problem is that as I go
through the artwork and character stuff, I forget to mention stuff like -- oh -
- the airdate, which station is going to be carrying it, that sort of stuff.

     Tomorrow, with luck, my new computer system arrives.  Way cool.
