     I'm saddened.  I'd only corresponded with Eric here a few times, but he
seemed always to be enthusiastic and friendly and cordial.

     It's a double shame when decent people like Eric leave us, and creeps
like Reagan go on, and on, and on like some sort of demented Energizer bunny.

     Very sad.

                                                                 jms

     (Yes, we do have a NYC station, but the list's at home.)
