     Marty: KBHK will carry B5 in San Francisco.

     Steve: We begin rolling film on the B5 movie on June 1st, and we wrap on
June 26th, after which we go into post-production.  The movie airs November
17th, and the series has several windows in terms of how quickly it goes after
that...it could begin as early as the spring, or later in the summer.  We have
to move *fairly* quickly because the actors' contracts will let us hold them
on option for up to 9 months after PRODUCTION is finished, not after the
broadcast.  So in theory, we should have to begin the series no later than the
following February...but that's still open to several factors.

                                                                   jms
