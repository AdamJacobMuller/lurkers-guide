     Oh, okay, THAT article.  I thought since it was a while ago that it
wasn't the one mentioned, but rather something new.  Okay, thanks.

     And now for something completely stupid....

     While my 386 was down and I was trying to log onto GEnie using my laptop,
if y'all recall, I couldn't get on.  FINALLY realized that it was because I'd
lately changed my password, put it on the macro for my main computer and
hadn't changed the one on the notebook...so I was trying to log on under the
old password.

     Sigh...I sometimes I think I haven't got the brains god gave a
doorknob....

                                                                 jms
