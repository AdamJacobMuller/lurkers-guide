      Those stations that agreed to carry B5 early on are all still
 carrying the program, plus a bunch of other stations that've been lined
 up subsequent to NATPE.  A full list will be appended soonest.

      The speculated-upon similarity to Japan was not unintentional.

      Regarding sub-light speeds...we're working that out with the tech
 crew.  Actually, EVERYONE is getting in on that aspect.  One design for
 a B5 defensive ship (kept in a high-security hangar concealed within the
 station just in case they might ever be needed...and they will...) runs
 like this...and I emphasize this was just his speculation, but it's
 kinda cool, whether or not it actuall gets used.  (It also came with the
 designer's sketch of the ship.)

      The ship is the Northrodyne C31-03 "Patriot," suited for both deep
 space and atmospheric flight.

      POWERPLANT: 1 Messerschmitt Ram-scram 23,000 kg thrust turbo
                  2 Commonwealth hyperspace ion-warp drives
                 24 Jumo 500 kg C02 thrusters

      PERFORMANCE max speed 10.75 C.P.H. (Light speed per hour)
                   stall speed minimum 400 K.P.H. on foils alone at 1 Earth
                        atmosphere sea level
                   Can achieve full-hover using Bokelman anti-grav
                   Max range fully loaded: 1200 parsecs

      WEIGHT: Standard earth gravity: unloaded, 35,000 kg; loaded, 114,000 kg

      DIMENSION: Length: 37 meters; Span: 43 meters; Height at max diameter:
                       8.43 meters

      ARMAMENT: 8 antimatter lasers
               18 "Blackhole" missiles with 1.5 megaton warheads
                2 explosive projectile 85mm ruger spiral-feed cannons
                4 "Reagan" class dumb-fire missiles
                3 pulsed accellerator long-range missiles

      CREW: 2, plus back-up crew for long-distance missions.

      Again, that may not end up being what's actually used in the show, but
 it's one of our speculations by some of the tech people.  Kinda fun.  One
 other ship that's been designed is the Blohm Und Voss-IBM BV142 V493
 "Nervenklau" class interceptor with ram-fusion turbos.  (It's a smaller
 ship than the "Patriot" class, made for speed and bite.)

      Are we having fun, or what?

                                                                  jms
