     ...good heavens, I'm quoted re: TNG?  Where?  How?  And where was the
"blight upon the earth" comment?  I know I was interviewed by some paper or
other about that, but for the life of me I can't recall which.

     Well, I never said I was subtle....

                                                                 jms
