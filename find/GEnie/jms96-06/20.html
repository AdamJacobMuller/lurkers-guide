     Though lately, from what I've been hearing from ST-oriented cons,
the toys aren't selling as well from ST anymore.  At the big blow-out ST
convention in Pasadena a few weeks ago, the 30th anniversary one, some
DS9 stuff sold, less Voyager stuff sold...and they had to send back to the
warehouse twice for B5 stuff.

     Now, as an aside....

     Warners has been running the numbers on renewal, and we've been
told that the numbers look right, and will be recommended for renewal.  Now
that's not the same *as* renewal, there are still some execs who need to 
stamp the thing and say domini domini over it (as John Copeland says), 
(in nomine patre, et fili, et spiritus sanctus, ACTION!")...it would take 
a huge and unexpected event to stop it now, and that doesn't seem likely 
at all.  So while I wouldn't say this is an eep, that formally hasn't 
happened yet, and it's WB's perogative to actually make that 
announcement, I'd certainly consider this at least an e.

     I make a point of saying this only because I'm going to be in the
UK this coming week, and thus offline, and won't be able to post any eeps 
that might be forthcoming.

                                                                  jms
