     Well, just finished the first (writer's) draft of "The Hour of
the Wolf," the first episode of year 4, to be directed by David Eagle.  
It was a tough one, like all first-episode scripts...but quite 
interesting, in its way.  Once again the show takes a somewhat different 
tone, I'm using some tools I somewhat developed in the background in year 
3 and am now trying in foreground, very interesting mood change...a good 
start.

                                                                 jms
