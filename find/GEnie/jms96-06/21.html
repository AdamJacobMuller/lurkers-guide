     Just got in late last night, still catching up...yes, we've been
renewed.  I dearly wanted to announce it here before I left, as has been
traditional, but it couldn't be done until we had the formal, final pickup
notification from WB, until which time it ain't real, and a) things can 
still go wrong, and b) the last time I said something too early WB rapped 
my knuckles.  It wasn't truly official until late Friday.

     We begin shooting again August 26th.
