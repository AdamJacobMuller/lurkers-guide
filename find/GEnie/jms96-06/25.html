     WB is coming down hard on all its shows (or so I'm told), on the
theory that a con showing = a theatrical exhibition, and they can be fined
hundreds of bucks by the showbiz guilds.  Now, in the history of hollywood,
this has never, ever happened...but the lawyers got their noses into it...and
at that point, you're doomed.

                                                                  jms
