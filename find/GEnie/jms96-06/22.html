     Araratus: most messages pass in front of me, but given that I see
about 500 or so per day, sometimes individual questions slip past me.

     Kwicker: a certain poet once wrote, "Truth is beauty, and beauty
truth; this is all you know and all you need to know."  If there is any
beauty to the work, then it contains truth, and thus cannot be a lie.  A 
story only has value wherein it touches an even greater Truth, perhaps 
even a universal truth.  

     Fiction, at its best, is truth...it's the real world that's a
lie.

     Sleep tight.
