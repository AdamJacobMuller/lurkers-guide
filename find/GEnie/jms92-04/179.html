     Well, excitement galore...and I may be off-line a bit because of it.  Big
winds in the valley last night, and at 3 a.m. the sun came up in the form of a
power cable that came down in my back yard, sparking and arcing and spitting
blue-red-white light.  Right now, the whole house is dead, and has been since
last night.  I'm logging on now via my notebook, but I don't know how long the
batteries will last.  (Jeez, sounds like a distress capsule ejected from a
ship, doesn't it?)  Anyway, will be on again when the power returns.  Expect
me when you see me.

                                                                jms
