     Mt. Joe, thanks for the info.  We'll see what now becomes of it all.

     I don't have Memphis or Little Rock on the list in front of me, but I
know they've added some stations in recent weeks.  Will bug the guys at
Warners for a more complete list.  The only super-station that I know of
currently signed to carry B5 is WOR New York.

                                                                  jms
