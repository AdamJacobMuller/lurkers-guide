     Understood.  Well, we'll stay on top of this, I'm confident it'll work
out one way or another.

     BTW...along with some of the things that have been discussed here that we
*are* going to be doing, I thought I'd pass along one thing that we will NOT
be doing.

     We've been slotted in on a number of conventions, and as things pick up
speed, others will be coming.  But one convention that I've decided we will
*not* be a part of is any of the Creation Conventions.

     Granted, they've covered other shows beyond TREK, including the
Terminator, Quantum Leap and others...but frankly, I've heard *so* many horror
stories from fans about them, they're *so* commercially oriented, treating
people like cattle, just to separate them from their money, and having had
some less than salutory experiences with them myself simply as One Of Many
Congoers, I feel that in all good conscience, I can't lend my support to that
organization.

     Fans are not sheep awaiting shearing.  And that, I feel, is the Creation
Con mentality.

     Keep it.  We'll go elsewhere.

                                                               jms
