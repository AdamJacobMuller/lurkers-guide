     Oops, a cross-post...briefly, the B5 buttons and the B5 t-shirts are both
limited pressings, just 500 of each, all made at my own personal expense,
supervised by yrs truly, and thus separate from other Warners publicity or
giveaways or Cool Stuff yet to come.  These are the only ones of their kind
that will be made; subsequent shirts, for instance, will probably not have the
Accept No Substitutes line on back, and the logo was changed after the silver
buttons were made, so those also won't be duplicated as originally made.

                                                                     jms
