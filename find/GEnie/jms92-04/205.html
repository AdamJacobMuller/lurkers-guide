     Note to myself: talk to some international economists, maybe raid a local
university....yikes...nobody told me there was gonna be math involved....

     GREAT looking gif file, Luis.  I like the color useage a lot, and it has
given me much to consider.  (The current version has the triangular part in
burnished/airbrushed copper, the 5 in gold...but there's much to be said for
red and black.)  Hmmmmm.....

     Insofar as I know, the overseas stuff is already taken care of, to a
large degree.  I *do* know that it was well received in any number of
countries, but don't have specifics.  Will try to remember to look into that.
I suppose I should know where it's playing....
