     Thought is going into the ships, and forms of propulsion, but that's
still in flux as we determine the needs of the show, and the station, and get
our tech people working on stuff that goes far beyond what I can ever hope to
understand.

     And yes, there's *definitely* an economy...both in terms of those coming
to do business on B5, and the resources available.  B5 is a necessary element
to preserving the peace, but that doesn't mean it's free from bureaucratic
meddling and cost-cutting.

     Remember, again, that unlike the Federation, this is not a monolithic,
all-controlling entity (Earth Central).  There's a *lot* of factionalizing and
splintering and wheels-within-wheels, so that leaves lots of room for
conflict.

                                                                  jms
