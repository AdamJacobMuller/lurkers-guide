     Boy, but messages fly thick and fast here...the Business Affairs people
still have to set the terms of the deal, but tentatively the novel will have
to come out probably late October.

     Interestingly enough, at one time our Xenobiologist was Indian, named
Chakri Mendak.  It was only after careful deliberation that I decided to
change the character to an african-american, which was done for several
reasons, not the least of which being that it would let me bring in some
Indian characters in other roles that could be quite interesting.   And yes,
overall I want to draw from a number of different ethnic groups and heritages,
because they each add something new to the mix.  And the context throws into
relief the fact that those OTHER guys are all aliens, but we -- whatever the
ethnic background -- are all equally human, and I think that will do a lot to
ease or even eliminate racism.

     At least, within the human species.

                                                                jms
