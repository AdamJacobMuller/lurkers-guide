     (tapping a ball-bat against the palm of one hand...don't make me come up
there...just wait until your father gets home...one more peep and we'll turn
this car RIGHT around and go home....)

     Now where was I?

     Corridors...yes, all kinds corridors, different shapes and areas and
atmospheres...some small, one or two REALLY BIG ones.  Don't know about fast
food joints, but we have something that I think you'll like just about as
much.

     By the way...can SOMEBODY here tell me how the heck to send more than one
carbon copy in EMAIL at a time?  I'm trying to send out, umm, certain
*instructions*, and it's taking me forever to do it one CC at a time.

     Thanks.
