     And spoil the thrill of self-discovery?

     Regarding Warners...yes, they're all part of the overall package of
shows.  Just as when you sign onto a network, you carry all of their shows as
a package.  As for the Paramount presentation...haven't seen it, and thus
can't comment (and probably wouldn't in any event).

     BTW...and before I forget again...I finally got my hands on the issue of
Video Toaster with the B5 cover story.  Anyone who'd like to get a copy should
contact that magazine at 21611 Stevens Creek Blvd, Cupertino, CA 95014.  It's
the April/May issue.  The cover price is $4.00, but I don't know what they
might require for postage and handling on a single-issue order.  (Note: the
b&amp;w photos inside are *not* at this time part of B5, but rather other examples
of related work.)  The colors are a bit off in repro as well, but not
seriously so.  (Mainly the ship, which is a bright orange/red, which is
different from the demo, from which the photos were composited.)

                                                                     jms
