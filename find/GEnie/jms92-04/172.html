     Re: WorldCon in Orlando...I don't have any plans at the moment, but I
suppose they could always be added.  When does it take place?  If it's after
the initial airdate, that could be why I flensed it from memory.

     As far as Laurel is concerned, her job differs in that Sinclair's is more
diplomatic/political, and is involved with the Big Picture of running B5,
where Laurel is hands-on in terms of the day-to-day operations of actually
managing the station.  If an ambassador has a problem with what the E.A. is
doing, he'll go through Sinclair first; if that same ambassador is annoyed
that his resupply ship isn't being allowed to dock because they won't comply
with the silly request for a weapons scan, that tends to be Laurel's problem
to deal with.

     Naturally, there is some overlap and shifting of responsibility.  If the
station is ever attacked, she is as qualified to sit in the command chair and
organize/dictate the defense as Sinclair.  Having run Mars Colony Security for
five years before coming to B5, she's quite capable of handling the tough
stuff.

     As for the earth/minbari war, yes, its repercussions will still be felt
throughout the show, and in time will form a major plot point.  There are also
some deep resentments remaining on both sides that we'll have to deal with.
What we show of it will depend on many factors, but I wouldn't be surprised to
see some scenes from it down the road...maybe late in the first season.

                                                                  jms
