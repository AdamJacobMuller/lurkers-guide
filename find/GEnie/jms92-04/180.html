     Ah, Luis, it arrived.  Good.  Sufficiently neat?

     Have got the ol' 486 back on line, power's back, at least for the time
being.  We'll see.

     So now it's back to work...too bad, I supposse, I was *finally* getting
around to reading the latest Lewis Thomas book on language.  Ah, well...later
for that, I guess.

                                                                 jms
