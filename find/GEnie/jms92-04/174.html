     Bubble-views (or real ports) ain't a bad idea at all.  And the points
about fighters are well taken.  And there will definitely be strategy in some
of what happens, if a series of ships should decide to engage a larger foe.

     BTW, Larry, did Ron show you the rough on the Vorlon ship?  Just curious.
