     Yes, I was referring to Etc/Etc...a wonderful piece of work.  Who else
can make the history of the word "sew" absolutely entrancing?

     We've selected a studio for audio post production, but can't release the
name at this time.  Soon.

     I suspect -- Mojo willing and the crick don't rise -- I'll be able to
release a *lot* of production information by the end of this coming week.

                                                                 jms
