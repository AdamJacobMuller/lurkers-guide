     Always interested in letters for the Suits.  Today alone we got in 25,
which we'll hold on file for an opportune moment.

     On other matters, and not to go into specifics (which are boring and
irrelevant to any viewer), while most of the time the process of getting a
show on the air is fun and exciting and interesting...at other times, I tell
you in all honesty, it's like trying to stack marbles in a corner or nail
Jello to a wall...man oh man....

                                                                       jms
