     Just checking in to say...er...nothing much to say.  We're in what can
best be described as the eye of the storm period...deal stuff and other issues
have been taken care of, we're lining up various pieces, and the real Busy
Stuff won't come for a little while yet.  I think we'll see the finished
motion tests on B5 this week or next, and the storyboard for the opening
sequence.

     Exhausted otherwise, having turned in my first M,SW script for the coming
season.  A real toughie to write, and ended up working non-stop the last 48-72
hours or so to get it turned in before hiatus starts.  I figure, last season,
my first really writing mysteries, I learned how to skate more or less in a
straight line.  Now I'm trying to do some basic circles, see if I can write
any better this season than last.

     So this'll be brief...gotta go sack out.  Hope to have some interesting
info by week's end, but I ain't promising at this point.

     Onward.

                                                                jms
