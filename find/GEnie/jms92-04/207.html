     Getting mentions is very tough, we're discovering.  And we're still
trying to figure out *why*.

     As for "Time Trax," it's a Harve Bennet show for the same consortium of
stations as B5.  It's about a guy from the future who comes into the present
hunting down Bad Guys from the future.  TERMINATOR 1 and 2 meets Soldier meets
Demon With a Glass Hand meets....well, you get the idea.

     Oh, forgot one thing on the Madison Square Garden reference...it leaves
Delenn doubly confused since this garden is *round*.

     I *think* that's the first and so far only direct reference I've made to
what happens specifically in the 2-hour script.  Have to remember to keep
those down to a mild roar....

                                                                  jms
