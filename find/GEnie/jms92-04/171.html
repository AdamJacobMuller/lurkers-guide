     Oh...one other thing...it might not be a bad idea for some erstwhile
sysop or forum leader to, say, advise the friendly folks running GEnie about
all of what's going on around here...the Grid Epsilon Irregulars, the Grid
Epsilon/470-18-22 coordinates, that sort of thing.  Might be an article in
this somewhere....
