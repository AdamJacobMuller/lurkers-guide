     About the details...there's just a lot of backing-and-forthing with
business affairs and contracts and paper work and the like...I wasn't so much
bringing it up as just sort of thinking out loud...which I probably shouldn't
do unless I intend to be more specific.

     As for the B5 photo on the magazine...what you're looking at is a shot of
the docking bay in the front of B5 Phase Two.  The independent sections you
see in a sort of grid behind it are the rotating sections that create gravity.
At the sort of right-bottom corner, that corner of blue you see is part of a
system of solar panels which have subsequently been dropped from the design.
The ship (orange, which is actually sort of brown-silver in the video demo) in
front is just sorta there, taken from another shot (which kinda throws off the
perspective a little).

                                                                jms
