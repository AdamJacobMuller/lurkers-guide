     No reason to feel foolish.  The cause and situation is quite real, and
believe me, I would not be doing this if there weren't sufficient cause.

     And check-ins needn't be during prime-time, that's something I should
have mentioned, but didn't.  And yes, I will very *definitely* note here when
and if the crisis passes.     

     Please continue to bear with me.  This is, as someone noted, truly an
extraordinary situation...and there may be a chance to take part in a
democratization of the process of television that may be something of a
benchmark.

     Thanks again, and as soon as I can come out with the full story, I  will
do so immediately.

                                                                 jms
