     BTW...I've tried hard to make sure that nearly everyone who's posted
substantially in this topic is on the list.  After scanning a 500 message
packet (eyes melting), I think I've got everyone.  If, after a few days, you
find you haven't gotten a note...please try not to take it to heart; there are
only so many to go around.  (And if you're a Constant Poster who's slipped
through the net, drop me a private note.)

     Info should go out tonight, system willing.
