     I don't know about the syndex situation, but suspect it's probably
something well out of my control.  As to how many people live on B5 at any
given point...jeez, *lots*, given that there's always folks coming and going.
It's about 5 miles long, and frequently crowded, so you're talking about a
goodly-sized community.

     Have pretty much nailed down the SF writer who'll do the novelization of
the B5 movie.  I'd wanted to do it myself, but time constraints just don't
allow that.  He agreed, we agreed, now we just have to let the business guys
work out the details.  Given the venue, the need to emphasize humor, action
and characterization at various times, I think it's a perfect choice.

     And known to all and sundry.  Watch this space for the news over the next
few weeks.

                                                                  jms
