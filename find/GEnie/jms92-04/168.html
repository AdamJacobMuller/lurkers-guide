     Good, all.  I know the stuff got out, so we're clear from here on.

     Mark: Jeez, but that's fast!  Yes, you caught the reference.  (And here I
thought it was *so* subtle.)  That's really amazing.

     As for commercialism or future products...when we do use them, we're
taking the approach that over 200 years, a lot of new companies have come up,
and a lot of older ones have merged, sometimes in unlikely pairings.  So you
might have Sony-Grumman (sp?) Starship Construction Company.

                                                                   jms
