     Thanks for the support re: the con decision.  It does seem the right
thing to do.

     On the Wild West...no, I'm not involved with that, the only connection is
that it's being done by the same company with whom I'm doing B5.

     Finally, regarding the illustration in the double-page ad...I should
clarify.  B5 has gone through *several* stages of visualization.  The very
first thing done to help sell the show was a painting of the B5 station done
by Peter Ledger, a leading graphic artist/illustrator.  THAT is the
illustration you saw, NOT what's being done now.  (That drawing is about four-
five years old.)  Stage 2 of the B5 station development was the video demo on
the NewTek tape, which many here have seen (and which bears little resemblance
to the original illustration).  Stage 3 was the new and pretty much final
version that Lawrence Conley and I and a very few others have seen.

     Now that video slides have been made of Stage 3, *that* is the only
version that will be used in illustrations and ads henceforth, either through
the slide itself, or an artist's rendering of that slide/image.   The
publicity people at Warners went bonkers when they saw the final version, just
loved it and have located a top-flight illustrator to do various renderings of
that image.

                                                               jms
