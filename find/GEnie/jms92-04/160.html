     Hmm...I suddenly get the sense that I've lost control of our merry little
group....

     No point in further speculation, though again one or two of you came
close.  Nothing will be confirmed or denied in any event.

     One thing, though...yes, we *will* be able to go in through the windows
of ships and B5 itself.  And to see what's inside.

     Mark...will get that file and take a look.  I keep wondering what a "B5
uniform" will look like since we haven't made *our* version yet.  On that
point, I have some ideas, mostly in the area of practicality of use and that
they should look fairly tough.  And stylish.

     BTW...saw the Lawnmower Man yesterday, and now I finally understand what
the heck Ron Thornton was trying to communicate to me about some of the things
that we can do with the new technologies we'll be bringing to bear.  It
totally turned around my thinking to new possibilities.  And as Ron pointed
out, much of the tech used in L.M. is now a couple  years out of date.
Apparently, he thinks we can do equal to or better than L.M.

     I must go away and think now...this could be most interesting....

                                                                jms
