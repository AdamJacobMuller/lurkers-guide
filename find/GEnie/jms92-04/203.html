     Yikes, that'll teach me not to log on for the balance of the day to get
some work done....

     Agreement with the sentiments above in the sense of letting the issue die
down.  Point's been made, no sense in belaboring anything, at least not here.
Any good that DOES come out of confrontation is, I've learned, lost if you
dance in somebody's face for the next 24 hours.

     Onward.

                                                                 jms
