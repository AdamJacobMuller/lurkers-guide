     To whomever inquired uptopic (so many flash past I can't remember now who
said what), I may have agreed to an interview for Synthesis, and if they say
it, I probably did...this is one of the problems in having the basic memory
capacity of a small kitchen appliance....

     To Arne, if you're looking on...thanks!  And BTW, I'm rethinking some of
our prior discussion, and maybe something can be worked out after all in terms
of supplementary venues for the story.

     On music, I'm frankly torn between Copeland, something like Ennya, or
Brad Fiedel's work (T2).  I like the latter's use of "metal" sounds, of
machinery in works, which would fit well in a station like this.

     This week, we'll begin storyboarding the opening title sequence, and
we've worked out a *really* nifty approach to, again, give it a very different
look.  (I scrapped my prior notion in favor to something nifty that Ron
thought up, something that the tech will allow us to do that I never
realized.)

                                                                 jms
