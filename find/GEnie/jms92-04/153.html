     What do the ships look like?

     They look like this (he said, holding up a sheet of paper with a Vorlon
ship on it in all its glorious color).

     What?  You can't see it through the monitor?  Oh.

     Although there are very few areas that I'm keeping mum about, that's one
of them.  See, what happened is, one afternoon, I was sitting across the table
from Ron Thornton, who sat slumped forward, hands cupping either side of his
face, elbows on table, glowering out at me from partially opened eyes.  In
other words, he was in Mad Genius mode.  We could tell he was percolating, and
adopted a courteous silence.  Did I mention that Ron is English?

     Anyway, finally he leans forward and says, "You know what every damn
bloody show on Star Trek *doesn't* have that we can do?"

     "What?" we said.

     "It would be really cool."

     "What?" we said again.

     "I mean, they can't even come close, they've never even *thought* of it,
but it's so bloody simple."

     "WHAT IS IT?"

     So he told us.  And one by one, a light bulb went on over each of our
heads (except for Doug Netter, the other exec producer on the project; a
candle went on over his head....why, we still don't know).

     One thing, though...Ron was right.  It *was* really cool.  So cool that
if we tell *anyone*, they'll think it's cool, too.  Lots of people, all
*kinds* of people would think it's cool.

     So *this* we're keeping to ourselves.

     Suffice to say for now that we're astonished that no one else has thought
of this yet, and that it's going to look absolutely unlike what you've seen
before.

     Oh, yeah...and it's *really* cool.

                                                                   jms
