     Two quickies:

     1) I wanted the station to have a real kickass look, so if in the right
light it looks forbidding, all the better.  Glad you like the new design.

     2) A word about the t-shirts....

          a) the XXL's won't be in until Monday, just FYI.  The others
     are going out now.

          b) Joe screwed up.

     As I mentioned, I went through about 500 messages and pulled out names I
saw of regulars, and just about everybody else.  In a separate file, I had the
60 or so names that were in one message here during the Loud Period who had
volunteered to help, and had been compiled.  In my mind, I kept cross-
referencing between them, making sure that there was no duplication, and no
one was missed.

     My error was in doing this at 2 a.m.

     There are about 4 or 5 people who *should* have been included, and were
not...only through oversight.  (At least, 4 or 5 that I know of.)   Two were
regular messagers whose name I'd seen so many times that I just assumed it was
on one or the other of the lists.

     Point being...if you've been here, posting, since the early days, and you
haven't received the information...please leave me a private note.  There is
no snubbing going on, it's just Yr Obedient Servant's own error and sloppiness
in trying to get this stuff out fast.

     My apologies to any of our regulars who might have been unintentionally
omitted.

                                                             jms
