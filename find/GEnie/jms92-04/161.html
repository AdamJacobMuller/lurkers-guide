     The Grid Epsilon graphic is neat.  Good work on that.  Re: the final B5
logo, it's done, and has been for a while, but I haven't yet moved the scanner
card into my new system so I can scan it over into a PCX file.

     One of the first things we'll be doing soon is working out all of the
"environmental" stuff, meaning insignia, rank, government, and other symbols
so we can use them in costume and background stuff.  When I have all that
collected, and my scanner back on line, I may put together a file containing
it all, or most of it.

                                                                 jms
