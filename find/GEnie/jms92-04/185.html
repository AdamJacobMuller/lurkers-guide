     Yes, I definitely intend to hit a number of other cons in the course of
this year, some large, some medium-sized...it's a question of time, market
(whether or not the area will be covering B5), resources, and the usual
scheduling conflicts...there are several conflicts that I have to  choose
between.  And much as I want to hit them all, it's a) expensive, and b) I
suspect that CBS would occasionally like me to WRITE on a weekend (I know,
what an inconvenience...).

     I hope to finalize travel plans for the summer/fall in a few weeks, and
will post that info as soon as it's availaable.
