     I think Dabney should get together with Bob Walker's aliens....

     BTW, spoke today with the leading SF writer who I approached about doing
the B5 novelization of "The Gathering."  It's a job I'd very much wanted to do
myself, but the time factor won't allow for that.  So of all the writers I
could think of, this was my first choice.  Was very curious to see his
reaction, since this would be the first time anyone well known in the SF
writing community has seen the thing.

     Let's just say that he's agreed to do the novelization, and that he
thinks it's terrific.  And that the novelization should be no tribble at all.

                                                                  jms
