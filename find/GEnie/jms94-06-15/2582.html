     Wayne...I'm sorry, but I don't define the "Fun Factor" in as narrow a way
as you do.

     On the referential stuff...you're wrong.  I view Delenn's comment about
"suffering the interference of others" in regards to matters of the soul in
"Believers" to be a reference to the Soul Hunter...later this season are
references, in dialogue, *specifically*, to Deathwalker, the labor
action/strike, Raghesh 3 and other areas seen before this season.   I just
wrote (and had to delete for time) a reference to the "Believers" story in a
season two script; it didn't show up there, but it will show up elsewhere.

     Your error was in jumping the gun.  Season ain't over yet.

     Frankly, you can only spend so much time referencing backstory; you have
a contemporary story to deal with, and should only reference a past story IF
it has a DIRECT bearing on the current story.  What you're asking for is an
agenda, a shopping list...there MUST be references to the past or it isn't
good, there MUST be injuries or death in a certain numerical proportion to the
series or it isn't good.

     I'm telling a story.  I don't have time, or inclination, to worry about
what your friends think the right percentage of death and injury should be in
a series.  There is a small percentage of fandom that measures its interest in
terms of how many people get killed, hurt or maimed, the "hurt/comfort"
fanzine types.  They think that's realism.  It's not.  It's the cheapest way
to get somebody's interest.  People also live to die of old age, too.

     So howzabout you just let me tell my story.  And wait for the rest of
this season, so you can see how you're wrong on the other point.

                                               jms
