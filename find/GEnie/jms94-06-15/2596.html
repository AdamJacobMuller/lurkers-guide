     Any time you spend talking at length with local programming people, you
will generally walk away depressed, because the approach and the emphasis is
diametrically different from what interests those of us in this discussion.
I'm not saying it's bad, just different.  Fundamentally, the show is the show;
phone conversations, reviews, in the long run, none of it matters.  If the
show is good, it will go on; if not, not.
