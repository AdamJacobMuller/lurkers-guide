     Babylon 5 will *always* be my first priority; it's my baby.  The other
two TWCBNs, should they go, would inherit others who would be more involved in
the day-to-day running, which I would then oversee...as opposed to the direct,
hands-on way I deal with B5.

                                                                   jms
