     Just got back from a whirlwind trip...too exhausted to write much now.
Grabbed a flight to Chicago last night, arriving around midnight, and came
back today around 8 p.m.  Basically 20 hours in Chicago and then turn right
around and come back to LA.  Without going into details (mainly because I
can't) at the moment, there's some non-B5 stuff brewing that could be
interesting.  (I may have to start two new topics here; TWCBN #2 and TWCBN #3,
for those who understand the reference.)

                                                                     jms
