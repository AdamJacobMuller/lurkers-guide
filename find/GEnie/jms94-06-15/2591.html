     BTW, before I forget (again....), I gave a brief interview to TV Guide's
Science Fiction column the other day, about the impact of the Moon landing
(speaking as the creator of an SF series).  Assuming that I said anything
reasonably coherent and nominally useful, it will likely appear in either the
next issue, or the one thereafter.
