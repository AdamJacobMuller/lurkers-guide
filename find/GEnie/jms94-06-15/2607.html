     Okay, so I *know* it isn't funny, and I *know* it's tragic, and I KNOW
it's a terrible thing, and I *know* it's sick...but watching O.J. and Co.
speeding through Orange County and Santa Ana, all I could think was, "Hey, OJ!
You just killed your wife and her friend!  Now what're you gonna do?"

     "I'm going to Disneyland!"
