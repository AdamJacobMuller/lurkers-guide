     That's not really the kind of correction I was talking about.  I was
addressing more general, behavioral correction, rather than the debate over
episode stuff, or details, or how many angels can dance on the head of a pin
(answer: as many as want to).

     Because SF is supposedly about embracing differences, there is a tendency
-- usually well-intended -- to ignore it when someone acts boorishly, or
rudely, or stupidly.  I've been at many gatherings of SF folks which have been
great, until one or two people really start making it ugly for the rest, and
unlike non-SF gatherings, nobody says anything or does anything.

     There are certain types of behavior that the outside world (non-SF) does
not tolerate; and a small portion of fandom thinks that because SF is not like
the outside "mundane" world, those same rules don't apply, and they can do
this stuff.  It's a very small percentage that does this, but they tend to
hold the larger percentage hostage through the feeling of, "Well, I guess we
shouldn't say anything.  This is our sort of family."   Well, when part of a
family gets dysfunctional, you have to address it.

     Again, all this applies to only a very small number, but it's enough of a
number to be a problem.  And I'm not specifically associating the  original
message with that sort of thing, only saying that there is nothing wrong with
correction if it is done in a positive form.
