     Sounds like this guy doesn't know what he's talking about.  There ARE
going to be new episodes, starting next week with "Grail," and we're using the
same writers as last year -- me, Larry, DC Fontana, a couple others -- and
adding a couple who I kinda want to work with, such as Scott Frost (on outline
now) and Peter David (ditto).  I've learned that things tend to get awfully
muddy at the local station level....
