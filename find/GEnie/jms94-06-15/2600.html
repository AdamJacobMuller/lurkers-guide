     There are those at the top of the stations, and those below.  What
matters proceeds from the top.

     Re: the comic...yes, there were discussions of other companies that were
bidding on it, but I probably shouldn't name who they were, as that might be
inappropriate.

     The first issue of the B5 comic, which I've written, is entitled "In
Darkness Find Me," which is the flip-side of incidents that take place in the
first episode of year one.  And there's a smidge of information contained in
the book that's *not* in the episode.  I think the script came out pretty
well.  I've also written brief outlines for two subsequent four-issue cycles,
which are now being assigned to other writers for expansion into full outlines
and scripts.

                                                                jms
