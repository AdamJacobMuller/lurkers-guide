     I'm sorry, but anyone who thinks that the Sinclair situation is a spoiler
and shouldn't be mentioned here...that can't be done.  Further, as I
understand spoilers, they refer to plot more than casting.  And I try hard NOT
to throw spoilers into this topic.  The Sinclair situation was news, and it
had to be communicated to the largest number of people so they would get the
information straight from the source rather than having to find out through
rumors and back-channel sources that are usually more wrong than right.

     It was, in my view, a public service, and I stand by my decision to place
it here, rather than the spoilers section, where fewer read it and the
information would do less good.  Anyone who thinks that information can really
be contained is living in a dream world.

                                                               jms
