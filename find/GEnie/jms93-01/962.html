     It's a very difficult area, and I thank Katherine for making the call for
me...it becomes hard at this end sometimes to call.  My sense, really, is that
if there are VERY SPECIFIC plotlines put forth, then it becomes an issue
suddenly.

     As an aside, though, one thing I did hear from the message was the
Vorlons as Minbari question.  This I can say definitively ain't so.  They are
two completely different species, with no common points of origin.

                                                               jms
