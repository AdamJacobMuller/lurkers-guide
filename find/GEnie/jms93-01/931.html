     Y'know, when I posted the original idea for an introduction, I had no
idea it would generate so many different responses.  And all with some merit.
Rob, the points you raise are correct: I've always felt very strongly that in
this show, and in SF in general, it helps to connect the future to the
present, to show the continuity of the species, of the common coin of our
shared humanity, our cultures, our languages.  I think  there are other ways
of doing it, and will do so.  But given the "pro" response, maybe there might
be some way of using this thing, whether it's as a promo or somehow using it
in the show.  (Y'know, it *could* be used in the course of a regular episode,
as I think of it; no reason why it couldn't....)

     Well, one thing's for sure...if it ever DOES get used, it'll in large
part be because of the reaction here.  Thanks.

                                                                   jms
