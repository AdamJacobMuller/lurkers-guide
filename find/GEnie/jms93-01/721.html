     The "Making of B5" piece is being re-edited; originally, the E! piece was
going to be the one shown, but...well, no need to rehash all of that.  The
piece is being recut, and new stuff put in to replace the old stuff.  It
should be finished next week, I hear, and then provided to the stations.

     Great news about Arisia, Arne.  Any other reactions come to mind?

     Re: using my posts for articles...by all means, proceed.

     BTW, it appears that the deal for a B5 game has been closed, and the
winner is Electronic Arts.
