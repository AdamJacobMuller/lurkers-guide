     How much combat is in the movie?  Not terribly much...I wanted more of a
dramatic series with action than an action series with drama.  The series will
alternate...some with lots and lots of action, some with less.

     The budget is classified.

     Re: the total population of B5...this is something that I went round and
round with as the designers and I worked on this thing.  They haven't given me
an exact figure yet; I imagine I'll get it eventually.  It's in the *area* of
a couple hundred thousand, though.  I *think* they said the max capacity was
around 250,000 but I could be wrong.

     (This is one of those things where the writer can't just set a figure and
wave a magic wand.  B5 is a particular given size...now you have to figure out
how much space is required by hydroponics, station systems, infrastructure and
so on...subtract that from the total available volume, determine how large the
individual living quarters are, with some variance, and then finally zero in
on how many people that could accommodate without squeezing everyone in like
sardines.  All I know is that there's math involved....)
