     Yes, I *strongly* believe that there has to be diversity among our alien
races...accents, political beliefs, religion, name it.  I think that is VERY
important.  Yes, from time to time, you want the monolithic, perfectly
homogeneous aliens, but if so, you want them to stick out a bit in contrast to
the rest.

     As has been noted, there's a *big* split currently going on between the
Minbari warrior and religious castes, for instance.  More will come later.

                                                                   jms
