     Yeah, you kinda need binocular vision for survival purposes and the
utilization of tools.

     Re: alien plans...that's something that we'll have to work out down the
road with our prosthetics people.  I don't think we used the full range of
aliens (both versions) as well as we might have in the pilot.   We get only
one medium-long shot of Black Eyes, for instance, and that's one that I feel
came out VERY well and should be highlighted more.  Some of the others were
less effective, but were kept to the background.

     I'd like to keep a mix going, about 50/50.
