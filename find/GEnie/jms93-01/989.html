     I'll ask Ron.

     This is one of those areas in which I'll have to defer until such time as
we get a regular science advisor on the show.  I know *some* of this stuff,
but fact is, I ain't a techie, and this genre is best served by getting that
kind of information from someone who knows what the hell he's talking about.

     (Which means we *will* be getting a science advisor once this thing gets
rolling, btw...no one's set yet, but will probably cull from one or two strong
possibilities over at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.  My plan is to also bring
on a freelance linguistics consultant to invent a few languages for us...and
that may be somenoe I encountered right here on GEnie, as a matter of fact,
but will wait until something Happens to give more info on that.)
