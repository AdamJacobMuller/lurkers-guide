     The background visuals for the narrative will be much the same for the
series as the pilot...a montage of the station, people and locales.

     Difference between an exec producer and a producer?  A producer can be a
line producer, who handles mainly production problems, or a writer producer,
who mainly writes, sits in on casting and stuff.  An exec producer is the guy
In Charge...otherwise referred to as a Show Runner, who sets the direction for
the series or project, makes final decisions on casting, music, sets, all that
jazz.  On B5, I share exec producer status with Doug Netter...basically, we
divide it up that Doug handles most of the deal making (which he loves) with
agents, other business stuff, and I get to play.
