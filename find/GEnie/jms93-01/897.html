     That's not a bad notion.  As it is, the date given in each season of the
show will change.  I.e., "I was there at the dawn of the third age of mankind.
It began in the year 2257."  Then, "I was there at the dawn of the Third Age
of Mankind.  It was the year 2258."  And so on.  So it not only tracks the
storyline, it'll be easier for folks to know which season they're coming into
as soon as they tune in.

     BTW, y'know, I was thinking about this discussion as I sat chewing my
lemon sesame chicken at the Good Earth Restaurant in Glendale this evening (my
Spousal Overunit insists that I eat something healthy once in a while,
apparently not believing that one can actually SURVIVE on beef jerky and
little chocolate donuts and Crystal Pepsi)...and I was thinking about how this
on-line discussion has now generated _ what? _ 7,000+ messages even before
the show airs.

     So I got to thinking...what's going to happen AFTER this sucker airs?
 I kinda suspect that either a) we will see a lot of "I WUZ ROBBED!" notes
followed by a silence vast as space, or b) this category is going to explode
in the biggest blast since Tunguska.

                                                                  jms
