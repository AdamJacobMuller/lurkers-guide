     Yes, GEnie is still my first choice.  You'll note I didn't call the
locale for B5 Central Interstellar System or anything dopey like that; only
referring to it (in bible now, eventually in script) as Grid Epsilon (GE).  I
post only a few messages there per week; this is home.

                                                                 jms
