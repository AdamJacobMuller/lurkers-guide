     It looks cool.

     Also, bear in mind that often different gravities require different
atmospheres; alternating atmospheres between floors in the same section is a
bit more difficult than setting aside one whole sector that would be, say, for
methane breathers, and which has a varied gravitational level as a further
accommodation.  (If they require standard 1g, there are other areas.)

                                                                  jms
