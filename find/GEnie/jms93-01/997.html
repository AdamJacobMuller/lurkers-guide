     Okay, okay, I got the lyrics wrong, but I got 'till *right*.

     Thing is on the language stuff...it honestly isn't my choice.  There is a
little thing called "separation of rights."  Publishing rights would probably
accrue to whoever does the language stuff.  It's not my call.  I would be
giving away something that ain't mine to give.

                                                                  jms
