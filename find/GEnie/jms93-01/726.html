     When someone asks, "What kinds of specific things have you gotten out of
this interaction?" I think I will point to the question just uptopic about
food.  I've given this a *fair* amount of thought, mainly in the sense that
there are hydroponic gardens (referred to in the script) and other areas for
oxygen reclamation, I'd figured that there were also areas where alien-
environment food was to be raised, and finally a third area where food that is
simply impractical to grow on B5 would be synthesized.  But the question opens
up additional areas that I haven't given that much thought to...and many
possibilities.

     Let me (so to speak) stew on this and get back to you.

     Thanks for yanking my blanket.
