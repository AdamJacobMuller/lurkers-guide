     What happens at the end of the five year arc?  The "Babylon 5" series
ends...if I have anything to say about it (and I do).  If something esle
follows, we'll see what that is, but it won't be the same series, or the same
title, or really the same characters.

     Barring that very distant possibility, at the end of the five year arc, I
take a very, very, VERY long nap....

                                                                 jms
