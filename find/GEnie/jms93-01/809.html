     That's simply a standard unit of measure.  Some series do more than 22,
but those are more rthe MURDseasons generally ran 22 episodes.

     22 x 3 seasons is 66, which is enough for long-term syndication, if
barely.

     And there won't be a Joe Jr.  One doesn't go through a vasectomy for lack
of anything better to do on a Friday night....

                                                                   jms
