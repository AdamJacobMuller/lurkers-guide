     Eric...imagine two boxers in the ring, each bloodied and exhausted after
11 grueling rounds.  It's now the last round.  You've each got one last shot
in your heart.  Your opponent comes in with a big name, with the sports
critics approval, with fancy clothes and a twelve million dollar windup.  He
pulls back and lets you have it with everything he's got.       

     Then you look around...and you're still standing.  And you're thinking
"THAT was their best shot?"

     Because everything he had was intent on one hard shot to knock you out of
the ring...speeded training, massive amounts of promotion, just to knock you
out.

     And you're still standing.  And you smile.

     Because now it's YOUR turn.

                                                                 jms
