      Mark, I've answered this question about as many times as I intend
to...if you want to go back into the discussion and read the info, you're
welcome to.  That article, for starters was put together LONG before the
general meeting with the stations at which point a true reading was gotten re:
the show.  Warners *cannot* commit unilaterally on any series without the go
from the stations, and that won't come until they've got a fix on how ALL the
shows are doing.  You're asking Warners to do something they wouldn't do for
ANY show at any time.

     I'm not cranky, it's just that I've now answered this about six times
here.

     Now exiting harrumph-mode.

     Re: supernatural elements...not per se, no.  There is some element of
mysticism and spirituality, but (one hopes) not quite so ham-handed.  My
feeling is that if it's there, DO something with it other than use it as a way
into (and out of) a plot device, thereafter dropping it.

                                                                 jms
