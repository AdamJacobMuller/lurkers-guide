     KL: though it galls me to quote commercials, I heard something on one the
other day that's actually quite telling...some restaraunter quoting something
his father told him: "The guy who says he never had a chance, never TOOK a
chance."

     What you say is correct: write it, send it out, write another, send it
out, write another...on and on and on...if it's good, sooner or later
somebody'll notice.

                                                                 jms
