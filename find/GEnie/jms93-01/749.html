     Yes, I've asked David (and he's agreed) to write the novelization, which
will probably commence within days of the series go being given.   And there
have been many screenplays published over the years, in script form/via
paperback or hardcover; I have a rather extensive collection of same
(including the aforementioned T2 book, which is extraordinarily good).  It
might be a good idea to do one for B5, with annotations, but not including the
"how to write for tv" material mainly because that's a) covered in my writing
book, which b) I intend one of these days to finish updating to Writers Digest
Books can stop yelling on me.

     Some random observations and thoughts which might be of interest....

     We've pretty much finished the final mix, as stated, which we'll review
tomorrow morning to be sure that it sounds okay on a small set.   But for
those of you out there with surround systems, and stations that will broadcast
in surround...me boyos, have YOU got a treat coming your way.  We did a *lot*
of work on this thing to emphasize the surround.   One act had over 100 passes
to make the sound as layered as possible (an average show has maybe 30 per).
The movement is quite distinct and compelling.  The sound EFX are also quite
good...the sound made by the weapons is also quite good.

     One thing we did with the weapons is to try, again, to be fairly logical.
If it's a BIG weapon _ rifle size or better _ then you're going to have a
quicker recharge time (if any) between firings, though you may have to change
packs more often.  At one point, you'll see a smaller, hand-sized gun being
fired a few times.  And each time, you'll hear a power whine as it builds up
the required power to fire off another round.  A gun that small simply
wouldn't have the capability to fire off one after another after another
without some power buildup that might not be present in a larger gun.
(Smaller guns are generally things you'd want to smuggle on board, and might
be as useful, in those ways, as a Derringer, which could only fire one or two
shots, as opposed to a machinegun  or gattling gun brought openly into battle,
and which is  intended to be used a lot.)

     Someone mentioned the positive aspects to building the maximum population
of a space station around available supplies and other very real
considerations.  We're trying, consistently, to ask "How would this work in
reality?  What are the SCIENCE considerations in doing SF?"  In general, we've
found that if you Ask The Next Question and try to be logical, you get MORE
options, and you get more INTERESTING options than if you just throw all that
to the winds.  (Often networks say, "Ah, screw the science on it, you'll just
limit yourself."  Not true.)

     During the final mix-down, a group of cub scouts came through the mixing
facility on a tour.  So we invited them in for the play-back on the next-to-
the-last act...this is the one where we kick over the table and it's pretty
much nonstop action.  Wanted to see the reaction of kids to the show, because
if there's a more relentlessly honest audience than kids that age, I don't
know what it is.  The fidget factor is enormous when they get bored.

     They didn't BUDGE.  For some of the shots, they sat there, slack jawed,
at what they were seeing.  Which is also good to know, that the show can
appeal to kids as well as adults WITHOUT making any dumb compromises (i.e.,
writing down, sticking in kids) to that audience.  I heard them later talking
about it among themselves, and though one kid was a bit unnerved by the whole
thing, the rest just went on and on about it..."awesome"..."cool"..."that was
great."  So far, so good.

     Onward.

     In thinking a little about the discussion, and what role I've tried to
play (and if I've seemed a bit brief or short of late, my apologies; the
workload is immense just now), and I don't want anyone to think that I'm
playing coy or just teasing about the series when questions about same come
up, insofar as story possibilities or plot stuff is concerned.
 Obviously, I don't want to give out stuff that would constitute the Ultimate
Spoiler.

     But there are generalities that I *can* talk about.  When this topic
first began, I was able to talk a little about what was hoped for in the
movie...to let people know what we were talking about, and what to expect in
exchange for the interest.  (I've always believed that you have to put your
money where your mouth is and earn loyalty by keeping promises and being
straightforward in what you do.)

     So what *can* be said about the series, what would you have to look
forward to?

     You will find out what happened to Sinclair, for starters, during the
Earth/Minbari war.  In that respect, the pilot movie is like the first chapter
of a novel.  For nearly 10 years, Sinclair has worked to convince himself that
nothing happened to him on the Line other than what seems to be the case: that
he blacked out for 24 hours.  He's just managed to convince himself of this.
Now, suddenly, someone comes into his life and with seven words _ you'll know
them when you hear them _ completely unravels the self-deception.  He knows
then that something DID happen to him, that someone DID mess with his
mind...and he is going to find out who, and why.

     This he will do.  And the ramifications of that discovery will have a
major influence on the series, on his relationships, and the future of not
only his character but many others.

     You will see what a Vorlon is...and what it represents.  And what it may
have to do with our own saga, and a hidden relationship to some of our other
characters (watch the reception scene carefully).  We'll discover that there
are MANY players in this game.

     One thing that separates this show from others is that on other shows,
very often you do things to them to make for interesting drama...you take them
prisoner, you make them kids, whatever...in this show, it's what's INSIDE the
characters that will pose the greatest problems...and the greatest
possibilities for drama.  Most every major character is either running to, or
away from something in their hearts, or their pasts, or their careers.
Garibaldi's past will catch up with him in a very  difficult way that will
affect his role and make him a very different  character for as much as a full
season, and have lasting effects thereafter.  Lyta will take part in a voyage
of discovery that will very much change her character.

     Some of the established empires will fall.  Some will rise.  Hopes and
fortunes will be alternately made or destroyed.  At least one major group not
yet known even to EXIST will make its presence known, but only gradually.
Some characters will fall from grace.  Others will make bargains whose full
price they do not understand...but will eventually come to realize, and
regret.

     At the end of the first season, one character will undergo a major, MAJOR
change, which will start the show spinning on a very different axis.  The
first season will have some fairly conventional stories, but others will start
the show gradually moving toward where I want it to go.   One has to set these
things up gradually.  Events in the story _ which is very much the story of
Jeffrey Sinclair _ will speed up in each subsequent season.

     Someone he considers a friend will betray him.  Another will prove to be
the exact opposite of what Sinclair believes to be true.  Some will live.
Some will die.  He will be put through a crucible of terrible force, that will
change him, and alter his destiny, in a profound and terrible way...if he goes
one way, or the other, will determine not only his own fate, but that of
millions of others.  He will grow, and become stronger, better, wiser...or be
destroyed by what fate is bringing his way.  In sum, it is a story of hope
against terrible adversity and overwhelming odds.

     That, in broad brush strokes, is a *taste* of what I plan to do with the
series.  I note this here because when the pilot airs, I am going to ask for
your continued help in supporting the endeavor for the series, and it occurs
to me that you ought to have at least SOME idea of what you're buying, and
being asked to support.  One should never be asked to sign a blank check on
the bank of one's conscience.

     Reactions?

                                                                  jms
