     Jonathan...............YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!  One at a time, please!

     The only questions I can remember...the vorlons have never fought a war
with any other race.  (At least none has ever been recorded.)  And right now
in the Minbari race there's a big split that took place after the
Earth/Minbari war between the religious leaders and the military leaders,
which culminated with the suicide of the Minbari commander at the conclusion
of the war.  They've now arrived at an uneasy truce, but with time, who knows?

                                                                  jms
