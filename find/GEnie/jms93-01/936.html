     Agreed on LBJ...he was something of a thug.

     Flat-out wasted tonight...we had a private screening this evening for
cast, crew, some critics and some Warners execs.  About 400+ people at the
theater in the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences in North Hollywood (in
the shadow of a 50 foot Emmy).  I don't think I've ever been as nervous,
because here's where all the people who worked their butts off get to see if
we screwed it all up for them or not.  Everyone liked it bigtime.  The few
critics who said anything (most headed out, as is standard, you don't want to
tip your hand) loved it...one CNN person said he hoped it would run for 10
years, another critic said it was the best SF television pilot he'd seen in
the last 10 years...I think they liked it.

     Sitting here now with a MASSIVE headache from fretting over all this, so
will probably make this short tonight.  (Harlan kept hitting me in the
shoulder after the screening, smiling and saying, "Will you for chrissakes
ENJOY this?  It's your night!  It's a hit!  It's wonderful!  This kind of
night only comes once in your life!  Enjoy it!"  I will...as soon as we get
the series Go.  Nothing can be allowed to distract from that.)

                                                                  jms
