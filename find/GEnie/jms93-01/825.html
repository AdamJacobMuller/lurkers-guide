     BTW, ironically, this is the only area that worries me in showing the
pilot.  People are going to say, "Waitaminnit!  This doesn't make any sense!
Why is a COMMANDER running this thing?  And what about this bit over here...?"
It's kinda risky to deliberatly program in what look like errors, but are
story points that will be raised and resolved later.   Ah, well...you gotta
take chances....
