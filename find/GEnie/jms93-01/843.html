     I've lost all track of how much time I spend on BBSs; two-three hours a
day here, plus 1-2 per day on CIS, and then other services.  I'm on several
where I don't post messages, and the folks there engaged in SF-TV discussions
don't know I'm looking over their shoulder.

     Why?  Because if people know you're there, they tend to speak more
politely about you, and your projects.  They're free to be brutally
honest...and lemme tell you, it brings one up short sometimes.  But I think
that's both good and essential.  Sort of a control group approach...see what
the opinion is like of folks who don't have direct access, and only hear stuff
second-hand.

                                                                 jms
