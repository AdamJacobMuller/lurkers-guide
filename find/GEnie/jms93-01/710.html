      I can understand about the feeling re: coming information and the wait
until February.  It's very easy to post info as we go into production, and
during production...but once it's finished here, which it will be as of this
coming Tuesday, the process is more or less complete.  I've tried hard over
this process not to blather on, but to say something if there's something
worth hearing.  I hope I can find new items to keep the topic(s) going as we
near airdate.

     (P.S.  The current newsletter is finished, and will be going out in the
mail this week, I'm told.)
