     The EA is governed by political figures, just as today, though some of
the structures have altered to accommodate a more world-spanning form of
government.  (Instead of senators elected from states, they're now elected by
country, and so on.)

     As for language...the DICTIONARY defines language, PEOPLE screw with it
until distinctions blur...as with the distinction between "fewer" and "less."
"There were less people in attendence this week."  No.  There  were FEWER
people in attendence.  This is what people do.  This is your language.  This
is your language in people...any questions?
