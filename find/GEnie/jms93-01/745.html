     I'll have to check w/Wareners re: the script thing, but under the WGA
contract, I own the physical script and its disposition.  Maybe the idea of
excerpts _ filmed stuff, or stuff we cut, missing scenes _ might be the best
way to go.  (And even at the rate of 1 page per day, you'd only get through
the first third of the script by the time it aired anyway.)  Will advise.

     To the question of promotion above...Warners will begin a real push on
this subsequent to the 18th of January.  They want to concentrate  their
efforts on the month just prior to airing.  So far, we've been dragged into
articles often on the basis of the controversy between the various shows...but
both Warners and I feel strongly that it's important to establish our separate
identity, not in relation to anything else.  Now that the other shows have
aired, we can now have an easier time doing this.

     What can I ask others to do?  Mainly to just keep the word out there; if
you see a local article mistakenly labeling B5 a copy, to let the guy know the
facts.  But probably the single *most* important thing is what can be done
when the show itself airs...and that's to write to both your local station and
Warners to let them know your feelings.  But that's if and ONLY if you
genuinely like what you see, and for no other reason.

     Will think about this stuff some more, maybe post some thought later.

                                                                   jms
