     Ninety percent of the stations taking the PTEN lineup have news from 10-
11, so that only leaves 8-10 for programs.

     The deal is that the stations and Warners pay 50/50, as I understand it
from the trades, for the shows, and I don't think Warners would want to set
the precedent of paying 100% for any given number of shows.  And because
they're 50/50 partners, it would be politically inappropriate for one arm to
unilaterally order X-episodes of anything.  As for the rest, there are options
on top of options, all in our favor.

     Re: post production timing and budget...we budgeted plenty of time and
money for post production.  When the sound folks came back and asked for an
additional day, just so we can be sure we have time for whatever little
corrections are required by then, that wasn't a problem.  As it is, we'll be
delivering the show next Thursday to Warners, and it won't even go out on the
satellite to the stations for a full month, and doesn't air for nearly six
weeks from the time of completion, so we're WELL ahead of schedule in that
respect.  They only actually needed the show 4 weeks ahead for
screening/reviewer purposes; we extended that by two full weeks.

     Another busy day in post today...but it's coming together well.  We have
basically just two more acts to finish, and will probably give all of Monday
to one of them, since it's massively complex.  (Usually you can do at least
two or three acts in a day.)

     BTW, and totally aside...I finally saw the tape of my last MURDER, SHE
WROTE episode, and it actually came out quite well, minus one or two very
minor glitches.  It airs Sunday.  (And there's a bonus to the Captain Power
fans contained in the name of one of the characters....)
