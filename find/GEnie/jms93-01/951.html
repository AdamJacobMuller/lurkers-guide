     Okay, here's the deal on the "Making Of" stuff.  Many of the stations
indicated that they might have a hard time knocking loose a half hour on TOP
of the 2 hour running time for B5.  So Warners is providing shorter pieces _
90 seconds, 2 minutes, 5 minutes, 15 minutes and 20 minutes _ to the
stations, giving them some flexibility.

                                                                   jms
