     Re: using the background TVs to show newscasts of recent events... what
an utterly, utterly, majorly COOL idea.  The frown on my face is only from
wondering why the hell none of US thought of that.  (Hmm... y'know, there were
invariably one or two guys in the crew running around videotaping everything
and anything...if you could have them also videotaping scenes as we were
filming them...splice in EFX footage as needed...wrap the whole thing around
the B5 Newscast Logo (and yes, we have one, it's in the pilot, albeit in BG),
it'd give you something nifty to have going on, and would make sense.

     What a wonderful and simple and effective idea....

     Thank you.
