     I can't remember when I was last this tired.  (Well, that's a lie, it was
during the last 2 days of filming on B5, but the former made for a better
opening line.)

     After getting zero sleep (nervous with anticipation, running the pilot
through my head over and over again to prepare for today), I went in with a
number of the production people today on the first day of the final
sound/dialogue/music mix.  Ten straight hours, one half-hour break during
which we ate at the mixing tables.  Trying different combinations, re-showing
scenes with slight modifications, over and over and over, until your eyes _
focused for 10 hours on the same focal distance, blinking against bright
lights so you can make notes _ start to melt out of your sockets.  And there
are three more days to go of this....

     But man, this thing is really coming together.  It's exciting to watch it
happen.  To the question about music...the music in this thing is just
terrific...dynamic, evocative, moody, exciting...and while it took me a while
to get it into my head (as with the theme from the Equalizer, which has
similar resonances), the theme definitely stays with you.

     Along wund editors, Stewart Copeland came by, as well as various of the
film editors, the cameraman, others...and Richard Compton, our director, was
also at the helm for the whole ten hours, as was our line producer John
Copeland (no relation).  People just wanted to come by and see it.

     It's gonna be a hoot, ladies and gentlemen....

                                                                 jms
