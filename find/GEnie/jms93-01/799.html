     To get past the language requirement, I took two semesters of German.
German I and German II.  Simultaneously.  From 9-10:30 twice a week we were
nice and safe and snuggly in a very basic German class...and from 10:30 to 12
noon twice a week (same days), we were dropped screaming like souls into
Dante's Ninth Circle masquerading as German II, where the instructor would
ONLY speak to us in German.  Which we didn't understand.  It was kind of a
trial run, an experiment to see if it would work, and the conclusion at the
end of the semester...at which point half of us were stark, staring mad, and
the other half were plotting to annex the Sudetenland...was that it didn't
work.  My basic problem (even though I passed) was that I was always week on
English grammar...so when I had to slam a word through the various forms and
declensions, I would...well, you've seen what happens when someone throws an
equation at me...it's a lot like that, only with a bunch of umlauts thrown in
for color.

     That was the same semester in which I realized that I wanted to get the
hell OUT of college and into writing full time, and started cramming courses.
I think I had something on the order of 23 or 27 credits that semester alone,
in violation of university limits (I crashed courses that were beyond the
proscribed limits).  And they weren't monkey classes, either, lemme tell
you...6 units of German, plus classes in Statistical Psychology, Biology,
Literature, Philosophy, and some other stuff (along with the 1-2 writing
workshops I took every semester).  To this day I'm still amazed that I
actually got THROUGH that semester.

                                                                   jms
