     I agree.  I wear glasses.  I could go to contacts (glass or plastic), try
surgery, all this stuff...but ain't nobody going near my eyes with pieces of
glass or knives or lasers, I don't care HOW safe it is.  Just my luck to hit
the one in a million power surge and I'll end up looking backward out where my
brain stem used to be.

     It's interesting to see how in pop SF, there is a tendency to assume that
Major Changes will take place.  Take a look sometime at a film _ the first SF
musical motion picture _ called "Just Imagine," produced during the 30s.  It
talked about a future world in which everyone would have personal flyers, no
one would have names any longer, only numbers, children would be manufactured
and people would eat pills instead of food.
 The time-frame in which all this amazing stuff was to take place?  The 1980s.
As somebody said, the future ain't what it used to be.

                                                                  jms
