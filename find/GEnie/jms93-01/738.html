     There's haze in some scenes where you've got a lot of traffic, and food
cooking, and braziers, and the like.  The quarters don't have that.

     As it happens, Pat Tallman has pets...two bunnies and two chinchillas.  I
pointed out to her that she now has both food and clothing concerns taken care
of.  She's still not speaking to me.

     Saw the DS9 pilot tonight.

     Heh....
