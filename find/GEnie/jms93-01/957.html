     Yeah, I'd gotten it, I was just swamped.  (Also there was no letter
inside, and I had to tear through bags of discarded envelopes set to be
recycled to find the mailing label with the correct info.)  Would've mentioned
it before, it's just...my head explodes sometimes, y'know...?

     Gary: that's *great* news re: KUSI.  San Diego's my old home town, so
it's good they're pushing it.  Wish I'd known about the promo, I could have
bugged some people down there to tape it for me.  Ah, well....
