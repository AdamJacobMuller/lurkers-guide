     Hah!  Phooey!  Why do you think I grew up...as much as I did, anyway?  So
I wouldn't have to eat that stuff anymore.  When I'm found dead at 90 in front
of my TV watching Babylon 5: The Next Generation, let it be with a coke in one
hand and a chocolate bar in the other.  As Mark Twain said, "If you can't get
to 70 by a comfortable road, don't go."
