     Hey, there's an idea...come up with a totally bogus B5 five-year arc and
let it get accidentally uploaded and distributed to throw folks off... except
of course folks might well believe it, which would work against us in the long
run.  Ah, well....

     Any telekinetics on board Babylon 5?  you ask?

     No.

     At least, not yet.
