     The background on that business meeting is similar to all such uses of
telepaths: both sides agree to the presence of a telepath to monitor the
negotiations.  If one were to demur, the deal would be off because the person
clearly has something to hide.  Which is why there is a good market for
various kinds of shields that don't LOOK like or feel like shields unless the
telepath knows what to look for.  You can also just try and hide it and hope
that the telepath isn't looking too deep or isn't really paying attention,
which is what that guy was doing.  (May have been reciting the "tensor" rhyme
trying to keep his brain occupied.)
