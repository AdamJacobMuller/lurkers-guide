     Rumors are exactly that...and as I've indicated, anything that  happens
of substance _ good, bad or indifferent _ you'll hear it from the source.

     How can PTEN be dead when it hasn't even AIRED yet?  I've hered this same
rumor from others, and have to say that if Creation is spreading this that
they are being *highly* irresponsible.  The facts again are these: the first
night of programming goes on later this month.  B5 airs the following month.
Based on the ratings for all of the shows, they will then open a second night,
or modify the first.  And that will determine where (and when) B5 lands.  It's
a logistical question about when to expand.

     If anyone wanders back in that topic's direction and would like to re-
post this as an official rebuttal, you're welcome to do so.

     I also hear they're showing the E! piece...guys, if you want to help us,
there at Creation...don't
