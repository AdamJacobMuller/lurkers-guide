     Something I forgot to mention uptopic, when asked if I can write a story
with kids...it's appeared in a lot of my prose.  The two leading protagonist
in my most recent novel, OTHERSYDE, were around 16...the lead character in one
of the first short stories of mine ever to be published ("Your Move," in
Amazing SF) was about 13, and the second story of mine published ("A Last
Testament for Nick and the Trooper," Shadows 6)  featured two kids maybe 19.

     Provided only for the sake of completeness.

                                                                 jms
