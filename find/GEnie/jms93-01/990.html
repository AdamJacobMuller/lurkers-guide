     As to what happens to their inertia/velocity when they come out, if they
accelerate going in...yep, we deal with that.  It's in the pilot, and we make
it clear that they have to take time to decelerate prior to docking.  I think
in Kosh's case it took something like 2-3 hours to decelerate.

                                                                 jms
