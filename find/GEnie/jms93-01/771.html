     Yeah, that was the hard part with the actors...they're so used to seeing
one costume actors in SF that even though they HAD other stuff to wear, it was
hard to shoe-horn them into it.  But that'll change.

     As for skivvies...who knows...there's a shot of Sinclair emerging from
bed wearing just about nada until he gets his robe on that several women on
the show kept re-running, saying "yum...".
