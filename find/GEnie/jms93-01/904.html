     How the various shows interface, and how one is linked to the other, is
best understood only by deities and studio guys; we'll have to see.

     Only problem with coke is that they changed the formula and now use
sweeteners other than sugar.  Though apparently they put out kosher Coke at
passover.  Eventually I'll have to get a proper dispenser with Coke syrup and
seltzer, since the syrup apparently *does* still have the s ugar in it.
