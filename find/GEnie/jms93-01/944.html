     I'll ask re: Ron's new stuff.  As for the changing technology, I'd like
to keep things looking *pretty* much the same, so there isn't a big or
noticeable jump, but things just sorta look clearer and better and more real
over time, rather than changing things per se.

                                                                  jms
