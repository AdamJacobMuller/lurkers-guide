     The current newsletter is due out this week, and any who sent in subs
requesting #1 will probably receive them at the same time.

     Re: merchandising...we have several deals in the works, the only one I
know for sure involves a computer game from a major company.  There will be
some supplementary stuff...shirts and mugs and hats and patches and
stuff...around the time of the pilot, at least so I'm told.  Luckily, my
contract with Warners requires my consultation on marketing, so nothing
embarrassing will come out if I have anything to say about it.
