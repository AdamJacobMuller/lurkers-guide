     Oops!  Nope, you're right, yes, there *are* shirts under the jackts
(actually, there are shirts under ALL the jackets, as you'd expect of
clothing).  I thought you were referring to the collar.  My error.

     Actually, *ALL* of the costumes are layered.  G'Kar can remove six
different layers of his outfit, Londo can wear the jacket with or without the
vest (which can also be removed for the shirt below), the Minbari wardrobe is
equally layered and can be played with as well, on and on.
