     I can't remember height ever even being discussed, except once, when we
were debating about two possibilities for a given role.  I don't think it
really matters.  As it happens, it probably won't ever come up because both
Michael O'Hare and Jerry Doyle (and I think Johnny Sekka) are all well over 6'
tall.

                                                                  jms
