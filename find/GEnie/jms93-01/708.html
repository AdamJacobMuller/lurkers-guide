     Aquila...let me try this again, since you may have missed it in other
postings.  Our current situation is ironic in that it has nothing really to do
with our show, but rather with the network.

     The chronology, and our situation, is simple.

     1) November 1991: Time Trax, Kung Fu and B5 contend among each other for
the first night of programming on the new network.  There are ONLY TWO SLOTS
AVAILABLE, two hours.  B5 and TT have the inside track, but there's a question
as to whether or not B5 can be done for TV *at all* given what we were
promising (a huge saga, state of the art EFX, a large cast, that sort of
thing).  So we have to answer that question by making a pilot.  The other two
shows go into series production at that time.

     2) They start filming episodes in August, about the same time we start
the pilot.

     3) We finish the pilot (barring our current last phase of post
production).  Warners LOVES the show.  The stations, which have always been
big on the show, WANT the show.  Warners tries to convince the local stations
to open up a second night of programming, with B5 as the anchor.  The stations
love the idea...but don't want to open up a second night until they get the
ratings on ALL THE SHOWS.  Not just B5.  If all the shows are big hits, then
they open the second night with Bt as the anchor.  If one doesn't perform,
then B5 becomes the replacement.

     Point being...and I can't stress this enough...there is no _ repeat, NO -
- problem with Warners or the stations in terms of confidence or anything
else.  They're chomping at the bit to go with it.  The only problem is that
their "box" in which to put programs currently can only fit two one-hour
shows.  Either they take one out, or get another box, but they can't give us a
go until one or the other  happens.  It's not like a big network that has 7
days of programming a week and can just drop in a show wherever it wants...or
a straight-ahead syndicated show.  This is part of a new network, and is
dependent upon the internal workings of  that network.  Which is fine by me,
it's just the way things are just now.

     Does that address your question?

                                                                   jms
