      Oh, yeah, the "mission of destruction" thing ONLY relates to this
particular episode, the pilot.  It'll be gone from regular episodes.

     For the series, my feeling is that the intro should be as short as
possible, almost more for mood than for information.

     The intro may also change slightly each season....

     As for software, I use plain old Word for my writing, though I just got
7.0 and will change over as soon as I decide I have nothing else of value in
my life to deal with.  I am but a simple man from a simple land of simple
values....

     The computer itself is kind of a hum-dinger...a 486/50mhz, 330 meg hard
drive, 650 meg rewriteable optical drive (for a total on-line of about 1
gigabyte), NEC 4FG monitor, 64 megs of RAM, SCSI 32 bit system, and due to
arrive any day now, the 6-disk Pioneer CD-ROM jukebox.  Also have the
Thunderboard sound card, Diamond Speedstar 14F video card, and a bunch of
other goodies.
