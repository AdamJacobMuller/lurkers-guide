     Rob: the scenario you posit is a viable one.  Nuff said.

     RE: the making of stuff...rather than a half-hour show, the stations
(which in some cases had a hard time breaking loose a full half hour) will be
getting promos from a minute-thirty to 20 minutes in length, which they can
drop in as they wish, giving them more flexibility.

     It *may* go out to them along with the B5 downlink, but I'm not sure.

                                                                    jms
