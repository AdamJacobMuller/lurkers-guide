     "I was there at the dawn of the Third Age of Mankind.  It began in the
Earth Year 2257.  Babylon 5 was the last of the Babylon stations, located deep
in neutral space.  It was a port of call for refugees, businessmen, smugglers,
diplomats and travelers from a hundred worlds.  It could be a dangerous place,
but we accepted the risk because Babylon 5 was our last, best hope for peace.
Under the leadership of its final commander, Babylon 5 was a dream, given
form.  A dream of a galaxy without war, where species from different worlds
could exist, side by side, in mutual respect...a dream that was endangered, as
never before, by the arrival of one man on a mission of destruction.

     "Babylon 5...was the last of the Babylon stations.  This...is its
story...."
