     Your teacher was wrong.  The dictionary accepts till.  If required, I can
call Mrs. Nash, assuming she survived the process.

     Re: aliens...yeah, there was a somewhat naturalistic look to the things
that I'd like to experiment with come the series.  This was a deliberate
choice on Criswell's part.  And by and large, it worked out okay.  I just
think that for the series, it would limit us.

     Criswell's elves actually did a *lot* of research, trying various
textures and color combinations drawn from nature.  Of course, that's all
nature as would evolve in an oxygen atmosphere, 1g.  We have to go beyond
that, and I think there's some nifty stuff that can be done down the road.
