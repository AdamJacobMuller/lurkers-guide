     Bear: you're an evil man.

     I like that.

     Re: "Night of the Living Dead," yeah, that's Patricia Tallman in the lead
role.  Which is where I saw her for the first time, and decided at that moment
that I *had* to use her in something.  She's dynamite.  I saw her at a number
of gatherings in LA, including the Horror Hall of Fame parties at Universal,
but didn't say anything because...well, when someone comes up to you and says,
"Hi, I'm a producer, I'd like to use you in my next big project," it's
invariably perceived as a come-on.  So I waited until the right opportunity
arose.

     Knowing she'd be perfect for B5, I had her called in to audition.  As she
was waiting in the hall, nervously practicing her lines, I stepped outside to
tell her that I'd seen her work, that she was terrific, and that I looked
forward to working with her.  Apparently she didn't have any idea who I
was...but found out when she was brought in to do the actual audition a few
moments later.  There was never any question in my mind about her doing the
role, and it was one of the smartest decisions I made in this thing.

                                                                   jms
