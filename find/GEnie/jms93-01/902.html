     Don't know if these will ever show up down the road; in a few cases,
where they're set pieces, we may actually be able to take one whole scene
which is pretty much independent of the plot and drop it into an episode as
part of a teaser.  (One, for instance, is an encounter with an alien hooker,
the other invovles a smuggler.)  They were cut for reasons of time: we were 25
minutes over length, and something had to go.  Several somethings,
actually....
