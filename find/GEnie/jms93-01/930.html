     "The Committee," which airs Sunday, is an episode of Murder, She Wrote,
for which I was producer/writer until recently.  Sorry, thought I was clearer.

     BTW, I recently made a horrific discovery about GEnie posting.  In the
past (since I compose on-line), I'd hit the carriage return at the end of a
line...and nothing would happen.  I'd wait.  Hit CR again.  Then I'd get the
new line...and figured it just took a second to kick in.

     Turns out that every time that happened, apparently the buffer or
something was getting full, and half the line wasn't getting through each time
it happened...so there have got to be some sentences of mine that make even
less sense than usual.  Now that I'm aware of it, I'm going back and revising
the line when I see the delay at CR.

     I'm meeting Friday with the computer game design people for a few hours
to kick around the structure for the thing.  Should be interesting; main thing
will be determing the degree to which this thing should interface with the
overall acr of the story, or exist totally outside of that arc.

     To the question raised 'way uptopic about comics _ yes, there may in
fact be one.  And I'm actually quite pleased with the idea (being a comics
fan).  Imagine what could be done by a Neil Gaiman or a Grant Morrison could
do with the B5 concept.

                                                                jms
