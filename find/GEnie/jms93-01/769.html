     The amount of contact required varies according to the telepath's
strength.  Lyta at P5 needs a little help.  A P10 could nail you from across
the room.

     And I want to have some fun with the commercial funding aspects of
B5...ads, gov't support, commercials, all that stuff.  That's an issue that I
feel really needs to be addressed...who pays for this neat stuff? And what
happens when the money runs out?
