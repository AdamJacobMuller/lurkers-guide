     From the Associated Press article by Scott Williams on the new crop of SF
TV series (specifically here, DS9, Space Rangers and B5), quoting David
Gerrold.  "I've seen the pilot, and it's [Babylon 5 is] the best looking of
the three.  I really do think that Babylon 5 will be the one for grownups to
watch."  (Article appeared in various newspapers over the last few days across
the country.)
