     There's been some talk of my appearing on H25 the Friday before the
broadcast, but nothing firm.  And offhand...I'm sorry, but I don't  recall the
date of the show with Ron.  I'm sure it's written down somewhere...but you've
never actually SEEN my desk, have you?

     Then again, as I think of it, *I* haven't seen my desk lately....
