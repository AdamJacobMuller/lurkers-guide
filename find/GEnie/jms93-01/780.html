     The software company involved is a good one, and the designers are first
rate.  As soon as I can announce the details, I will.

     And yeah, I get one of everything.  I may need a bigger house....

     The best way to make sure one gets in on any upcoming marketing is
probably to write Warners marketing (I believe it's the Licensing Corporation
of America...maybe someone here has an address) and ask to get on a mailing
list for info.

                                                                 jms
