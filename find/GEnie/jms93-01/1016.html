      Rob: that was very funny stuff.  And believe me, I know from Gummo;
 the Flammo reference was from a play by Louis Phillips, "The Last of the
 Marx Bros. Writers," very surreal, where they mention Flammo.  The play
 is about...well...the last surviving Marx. Bros. writer, who is living in
 a one room flat, doesn't go out, and keeps having delusional conversations
 with God.  "Make Me Laugh," God says.  The writer starts a joke.

      "Heard it," God says.  Which is, of course, the problem...he's heard
 ALL of them.

      BTW, if you're a true-blue Marx Bros. fan, you might want to find (if
 you already haven't) the book "Flyweel, Shyster and Flywheel," which
 contains many of the radio scripts of that Marx Bros. show, no surviving
 audio copies of which have survived.  Very, very funny stuff.

      "How much do you charge to perform?"
      "Ten dollar."
      "How much to perform but leave out the rehearsal?"
      "Twenty dollar."
      "How much not to perform at all?"
      "Oh, no, boss, you couldn't afford it...."

                                                                 jms
