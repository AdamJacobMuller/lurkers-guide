     Yes, Lyta's always had an affinity for alien races from a telepathic
standpoint.  As for telling reality from subjective; as soon as it goes in
your eyes, it becomes subjective.  So that's the only POV from which she can
act.  It's easiest when it's straightforward visual or auditory impulses, not
much open to coloring by the subjective aspect.  If the person being scanned
is unbalanced, then 1) it becomes VERY uncomfortable for the psi, and 2) there
are signature aspects of the scan (colors, hallucinations, delusions) that
would tip off any good psi that this may not be a very valid perspective.
