     Aha!  Yes, THAT was the last one, an EA atmospheric shuttle.  To the
other points...no, that's a Narn cargo transport in the current version; the
Narn fighters are much sleeker.  Also, the Centauri ship in the current batch
is a personal liner, as used by Lady Ladira in "Signs and Portents."  The
Centauri transport I'm referring to, in the later batch, is this purple, bug-
like thing with a tall fin rising out of the back.  It looks kinda like a flat
potato bug.
