     One of the problems we've encountered in the past is that Paramount tends
to buy LOTS of advertising in pubs like Entertainment Weekly and others, and
some of them have no desire to piss of the big P.  I got a note from one of
the staffers at Sci-Fi Entertainment (the Sci-Fi Channel is co-owned by
Paramount) who indicated that there was a very clear and deliberate emphasis
on not doing B5 coverage for that reason.   But another reporter is going to
be doing a small piece on the show for an upcoming issue, so maybe we'll shake
that loose finally.
