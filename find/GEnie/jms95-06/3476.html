     Generally, there is a brief description of the character in the script,
which the casting director receives to prepare.  If there's anything I have in
mind in particular, and there often is, I'll discuss it with the c.d. and
narrow things down.  T

     Then I'll get a preliminary list of available actors, those who are and
aren't available for auditions.  We call in those who come to auditions, and
try them out.  If nobody works out, we go to the list of actors who won't
audition, and review tapes.  This rarely happens, though, and we prefer to go
from auditions.

                                                                    jms
