     Apparently Channel 4 in the UK will broadcast all 4 remaining year two
eps starting July 25th and continuing each Tuesday thereafter until all four
have been aired.  (There had been some discussion of airing them all the same
night in a B5 marathon, but this is probably better for reaching people.)

                                                                jms
