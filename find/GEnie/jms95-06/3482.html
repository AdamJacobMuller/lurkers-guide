     Two of the four episodes have been delivered for some time; number three
gets delivered this week; number four, the week therafter.

     The original theory was to have the eps ready in time to air all four in
July.  That was our timetable as we understood it at the time for WB/PTEN, and
that's what was plugged into the formula when we did our production schedule.
