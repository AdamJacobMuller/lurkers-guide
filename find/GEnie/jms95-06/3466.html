     Got the phone call late today, spent the next bit on the phoen with
people who had to be notified.  Didn't get a chance to log on until just now. 
Yes, it is now safe to say..............eep.

     The official announcement of BABYLON 5's second season will be made
tomorrow by Warner Bros.

     Naturally, the day the word comes is the day I'm kinda down with a slight
bug, which kinda takes the edge off it...but suffice to say that Brett's
observation is correct; with this new season, we'll be 3/5ths done with the
story, over half.  

     Suffice to say we are all very happy, and looking forward to shooting
Year Three commencing about July 31st.  (And half the fun, well a quarter of
the fun, is knowing just how many people in what groups are going to be SO
pissed off that we've been renewed....)

                                                                jms
