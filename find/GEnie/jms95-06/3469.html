     I wrote some of the .avi stuff, including the Vorlon/IRQ thing, since
it's something that perpetually makes me nuts.

     There's always been a side-story that could go off after B5 finishes its
run, but I doubt it'll go anywhere, even if B5 does break out.

     Interestingly enough...one of the first clues we got that we'd been
renewed was a call from the WB International folks, asking about a third
season.  Apparently, what Ch4 wants to do for year 3 is to air the show in its
original, widescreen aspect ratio.  They called to see if we could let them
have access to our original negative to re-transfer it back to that format,
for their broadcast.  Our reply: hell, yes.

     Expect some new characters next season, yes.

                                                                  jms
