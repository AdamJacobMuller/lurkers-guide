     On places like internet, I look for new threads that haven't been
answered yet, and deal with those first.  Then I peel through the messages I
know contain interesting or funny threads, and get into those.  If a thread
has been going on for a long time, and has more or less devolved into
woolgathering, I bail.

     The other systems, I just sorta graze, looking for interesting areas.
There are some topics here on 18 -- TV stations, filking, topic drift -- that
I don't generally check out.
