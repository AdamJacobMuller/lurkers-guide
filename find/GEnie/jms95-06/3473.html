     dj...one of the...I won't say problems, because it isn't a problem, but
the...unique aspects about this cast is that they're in large measure *very*
bright, and very verbal, and some of the banter that goes back and forth, done
totally poker-faced and straight, could be taken in the wrong light.  Look at
some of the comments between me and Claudia on some of the on-line interviews
at AOL and DC Comics Online.  We can get pretty brutal if you don't know we're
absolutely just putting it on.  

     So if you want to pass it along in private mail, that's fine, but on
balance, I'm not terribly concerned about it; it's how we play.
