     We *do* have accurate estimates; I'm not quite sure how we got off on
this.

     Warners gives us required delivery dates.  We work backwards from those
delivery dates, and come up with a shooting schedule that allows us to meet
those dates with room to spare.  So I'm not quite sure what it is we're not
doing.

                                                               jms
