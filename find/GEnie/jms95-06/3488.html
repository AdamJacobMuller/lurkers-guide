     Just a note on a B5 alumnus; it appears that Christy Marx has got her own
series, co-created (I think that's the credit, but she'll have more on the
specifics when she's ready to talk about it) by her and someone known to
B5'ers (no, not me).  It's a live-action SF series, and should look very cool,
a whole new universe to play in.  Anything more specific will have to come
from her, as is appropriate.  Y'all can keep tabs on this over in her topic,
470/11/43.

                                                                     jms
