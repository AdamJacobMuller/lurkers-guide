     Actually, some PR departments at studios/networks *have* been wrong about
such things in the past.

     The reason for the delay was that there were some structural and
corporate things going on with PTEN that had nothing to do with us per se, but
which could ultimately affect us.  There was one brief period last week --
Thursday and the first part of Friday -- when the corporate stuff seemed to
put our fate in doubt.  The words actually entered my head, "Oh crap, they're
gonna cancel us."  It was a very depressing 24 hours.  But finally word came
back that the logjam had been fixed, the pieces had all come together, and
things were looking positive again, but final word wouldn't come until this
week.

                                                                jms
