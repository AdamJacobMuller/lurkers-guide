     To all in the Chicago area, I have the schedule for B5 stuff, or most of
it, for the Comic Con this weekend in Rosemont at the convention center.

     FRIDAY: 3-4 jms and bloopers, and stuff
             4-5 Michael O'Hare's acting workshop 

   SATURDAY: 11-12 noon Q&amp;A with Michael
             1:30-3 special jms presentation (*be there*)
               4-5 jms writing for TV seminar
             (that evening is an informal B5 gathering with me,
               Michael and Peter David, don't know when or where)

   SUNDAY:   1-2 B5 panel with jms, Michael and Peter


      Word to the wise: arrive early for the Saturday 1:30 presentation; we'll
start right on time, and there's a lot to fit in.  

                                                                   jms
