     Background info required to follow episodes is ALWAYS included in those
episodes.  Background info NOT required to follow stuff, but just for fun, is
sometimes given on the nets and not referenced in the show, or more often,
will eventually be referenced in the show.  Also, it's been mentioned before
that you don't have to read the comics or the novels to follow the show; the
stories are complementary but exclusive.
