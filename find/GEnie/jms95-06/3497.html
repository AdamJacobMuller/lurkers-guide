     There was just a huge message posted on rec.arts.b5 about BB, a real
scathing review.  Others are filtering in along the same lines.  As I'd been
worried about, apparently the organizational aspects are a total
nightmare/disaster.  But I'll let others speak from their own experience. 
(The J.Potts message on rec.arts is very telling, as he's generally a very
good reporter on this stuff.)
