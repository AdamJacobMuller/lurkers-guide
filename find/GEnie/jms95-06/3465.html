     I'm not being cute, or close, or withholding information: straight
up...we have still not been given any official word about renewal.  That
official word comes in a call from WB business affairs, authorizing us to
activate our contracts and pick up our options with actors, directors, crew,
others.  That call has not yet come.  We've heard all kinds of rumors from WB
lately.  Some good, some bad, mostly involving changing situations with PTEN,
nothing to do directly with us.  

     Whatever you were told, it ain't "official" until we're notified, as the
producers.  That notification has still not yet come.
