     I will tell you a true and secret thing, re: Londo's dream, and looking
up into a blue sky to see the ships passing overhead.

     Ever since I was a kid, I've had that image in my dreams, of standing out
in the open and looking up as strange dark ships pass overhead.  It's always
been an unnerving image, and I really wanted to use it here to see if it would
have the same effect on others.

     The other single most recurring image is to be standing at the bottom of
a long set of stairs, in a basement, and the door at the top of the stairs is
thrown open, and there's gunfire, and guards, and flares in the night beyond,
and more ships firing down.

     Don't be surprised if this shows up as well, someday....

                                                                   jms
