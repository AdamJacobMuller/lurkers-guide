     I'm very happy at the reaction.  I was telling John Copeland a bit ago,
when we finished the episode, "Maybe we ought to superimpose a crawl before
the first frame of the teaser saying, "JUST IN CASE YOU THOUGHT WE WERE
KIDDING.""

     An aside on the jms/kosh discussion, for whatever interest it may
have....when Ardwight comes in to do Kosh, they call me in to direct his
performance so that it matches what the intent is now, and how it will be
interpreted later.  From where I sit in the control room, I can't see him, I
can only hear his voice.  So it's kinda like talking with Kosh there, and me
saying, "Okay, can you try 'In Fire' hitting the second word harder, and with
a sense of some anger behind it?"  And between takes, he's still in Kosh-speak
mode, muttering, "How will this end, how do I know talk to my agent...go on,
get out, buzz off...."

                                                                      jms
