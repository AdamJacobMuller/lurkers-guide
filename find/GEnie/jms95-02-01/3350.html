     I think Campbell was very interesting.  I have many of his books,
including those on occidental and oriental mythologies, Hero With A Thousand
Faces, others...very cogent and thought-out analyses.  I don't think, though,
that you can consciously attempt to utilize them in your storytelling, because
then you're trying to out-think yourself.  These examinations work best AFTER
the fact; otherwise it's like the centipede trying to analyze which foot goes
first.

                                                                 jms
