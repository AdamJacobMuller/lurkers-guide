     The CD is from Sonic Images, and I just finished approving the final
stages of the revised booklet inside (more pictures, including a three shot of
me, Doug and John), and having reviewed the additional suite, which is I think
about 12 minutes long, making the whole CD about 55 or 56 minutes.  It will be
hitting stores sometime in March; the first 2,000 copies right off the press
are already earmarked for the UK, to fill a backlog of orders.

     If you haven't got a copy of the soundtrack, and want one, I very
strongly suggest you go to your record store locally or contact a discount
distributer and pre-order; the limited edition went out in a flash, and while
Sonic Images can do good sized orders, they're not as fast as, say, a Warners
Records.  These things are going to fly out the door, and if they know how
many to advance produce, that'll help minimize any shortages.

                                                                    jms
