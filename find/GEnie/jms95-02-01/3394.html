     Which is basically deliberate.  Now we begin the process of narrowing
down these threads, and collapsing some of them, so that we see that A and B,
originally perceived as two different things, are actually aspects of the same
thing.  Since so much has been thrown out, the next episdoes after this are
kinda focused on only one or two elements at most.  You've been hit with a
lot; now's time to pull back a little and let people breathe and digest what
they've seen.  Then, as stated, you start peeling back the layers and tossing
out the red herrings so you can concentrate on the important aspects.  (And,
really, there's not *that* much, minus that pennultimate scene in Sheridan's
quarters, that isn't an extension of what has gone before...Delenn was told
that she might be dropped from the Grey Council in "Babylon Squared," and the
information about the President has been sort of there in the background ever
since Chrysalis.

     Even so, though, this concern has been anticipated, and built around.
