      To the Brady Bunch Theme

 It's the story
 Of a bunch of filkers
 Who simply couldn't leave B5 alone
 They were cruising
 For a bruising
 Riding the modem tone.

 It's the filking
 That drives you crazy
 With rhymes that cut you clear down to the bone
 Even more scary
 Than Mayor Barry
 It makes you groan and groan

 Till the one day the filkers met a producer
 And they knew that they were clearly out of luck
 Now this group must somehow cross the border
 Or risk assault and mayhem from a truck.

 The Filking Bunch.
 The Filking Bunch.
 Run away from the scary Filking Bunch.
