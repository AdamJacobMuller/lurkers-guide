     The Sanctuary is entirely a virtual set.  It's all blue-screen, no walls,
no windows, no stars, no nothing.  I made sure to ask Foundation and Mitch to
blur the walls a bit in close up to give it the correct depth of field.  (Much
of the CGI/background work is done by Mitch, our effects guy, who works
independent of Foundation, who was also the main EFX guy on Predator, ET and
others.)  Because that was a LONG scene, the rendering time was just hideous.

                                                                  jms
