     An accident of casting.  Turhan had come in on an audition for the part
of Elric in "Geometry," but while we wanted someone with more sheer menace
(which Ansara gave us), we were just charmed out of our socks by him.  I swore
right then that I'd write a part designed just for him, and no one else.

                                                                 jms
