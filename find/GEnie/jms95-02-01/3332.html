     Well, after nudzhing them for the last two years, finally SFWA has given
in to Harlan's insistence about changing the Grand Master Nebula awards rules,
since we were and are on the verge of losing many of those deserving of the
honor, and why the hell can't we amend one bitty rule to give out a couple at
a time rather than once every two years?  Granted it doesn't go all the way
(and of course it wasn't in the LEAST due to outside pressure), but at least
now it'll be once a year rather than once every two years...and this comes on
a day when R.A. Lafferty has a stroke, I'm told.

     BTW, and totally unrelated (well, mostly)...Harlan will be on the Tom
Snyder show on the 17th of this month.
