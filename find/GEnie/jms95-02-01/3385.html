     On the chance that the datacrystal might fall into the wrong hands, I had
Sinclair deliberately avoid using Garibaldi's last name, and avoid Delenn's
altogether (since she has only the one).  The Ranger was told to deliver the
crystals at the cost of his own life if necessary...but  sometimes such orders
don't end well for the messenger.  So both messages began the same way.

     Re: the Ranger's pin...I kind of designed this, working with Ann Bruice,
our costumer.  I sketched out what I had in mind, which is two figures at
either side of the brooch, one minbari, the other human, joined and made of
the same metal, over a precious stone.

                                                                    jms
