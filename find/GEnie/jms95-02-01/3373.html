      I don't think we'll be doing a 900 number ever, frankly; though I find
the idea of 1-900-ASK-KOSH more than just a little amusing.

      "Hello, this is Julie from Wisconsin, and I was wondering if I will be
successful in my new job?"

      "Beauty...in the dark."

      &lt;click!&gt;&lt;that'll be $2.50, please.&gt;

                                                                 jms
