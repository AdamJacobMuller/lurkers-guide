     Sean: if you could send me a copy of that TV Guide piece asap, I would be
*profoundly* grateful.

     Slowly, we're starting to get noticed.  Break Magazine, out of North
Carolina, just did a very good three-page review that says B5 "has set the SF
TV world on end with the quality of its writing...stories that are gripping
and speculative...if you haven't checked out Babylon 5 you owe it to yourself
to do so.  This is, without doubt, the best science fiction series ever
produced.  Give it the next six weeks.  You'll be hooked."   (Reviewed by
staffer Tom Poston.)

                                                                      jms
