     It's my understanding that, for instance, while the navy does not salute
uncovered, the army and air force can or do.  So we've tried to vary our
salutes (Colonel Ben Zayn and General Franklin, both army or marine types, got
salutes uncovered, for instance, while others may not).

     Funny ad in this week's BATMAN comic, for a company called French Toast,
their French Toast Profile, showing a kid and a (probably bogus) bio, listing
his name as Michael O'Heir, whose biggest wish is to meet an alien from
another galaxy, and whose goal in life is to become a Commander at NASA.

     Hmmmmmmmmmmm....
