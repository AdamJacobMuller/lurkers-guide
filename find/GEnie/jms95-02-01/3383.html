     The "ban" was only for the satellite viewers; now that the show has begun
to air regionally, anybody can talk about anything.

     (And it was just a request, not a ban; I don't have the power to enforce
one, and wouldn't want to do so in any event.  Common courtesy, and a
request...which was wonderfully accommodated.)
