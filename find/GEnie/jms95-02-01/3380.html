     Unfortunately, I've never been able to dictate scripts.  I need to SEE
the words on the page.  A lot of what I write has a certain rhythm to the
language, and I can only see that on the page.  (People who have gotten used
to my writing can sometimes tell exactly where a jms scene appears in another
script by the rhythms.)  For me it all happens when I fall through the page.

                                                                   jms
