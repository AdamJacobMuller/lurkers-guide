     My two systems (at present): both are Pentiums, 32 megs ram, onboard 3x
CD Rom, external jukebox CD Rom changer, external rewriteable magneto optical
Iomega changeable drive (620 megs each), 64 bit #9GXEPro card in one system (1
meg VRAM), and 128 big Imagine card (4 megs VRAM) in the other, Supermatch 17"
(former) and Nanao 17" Flexscreen (latter), 2 gig sized hard drives in former,
1 gigabyte hard drive in the latter, plua (plus) with the other a Kinesis
ergonomic keyboard (which is actually working out), plus both have
Soundblaster 16 sound cards and enhanced IDE systems for running SCSI stuff.

     They didn't arrive so much as taxi in under the watchful gaze of guys in
orange vests.
