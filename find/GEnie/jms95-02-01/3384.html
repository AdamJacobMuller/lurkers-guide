     There are some episodes coming that are about as intense as this, though
not as much *happens*, in the sense of a bunch of events affecting lots of
people in different places.

     Yes, intentional parallel structure to "Midnight," which is why I
included the shot from that episode in Londo's dream.  I like irony.

                                                              jms
