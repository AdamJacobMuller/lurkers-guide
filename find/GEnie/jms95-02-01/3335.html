     I thought the size of your hands was indicative of the size of your
dish....

     The comics and novels are within B5 continuity in general, but bear in
mind you've got a LOT of different people working on these things, so some of
the finer points may vary.  In general, we're keeping it as much within our
universe as possible; but as an adjunct, not required reading, since that's
unfair to viewers.

     I'm pretty sure the pilot wings are uniform across the board.

                                                                   jms
