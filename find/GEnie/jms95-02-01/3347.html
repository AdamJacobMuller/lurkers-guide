     Unfortunately the station doesn't have the budget for that, and it's
easier to deal with what you have than pour more money into it in the hopes of
revenue down the road.  Kinda like Congress.  Also, the areas of downbelow are
mainly crummy, near the waste recycling system, the air compressors, the water
reclamation facility...not exactly choice real estate.
