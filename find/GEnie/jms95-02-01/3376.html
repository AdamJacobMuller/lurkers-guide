     Quickie alert...looks like Claudia, Mira, maybe Jerry and definitely I
will be making an appearance next Thursday evening (16th) at Planet Hollywood
in Chicago, in part to promote the coming convention, and in part to promote
the show in general.

                                                                  jms
