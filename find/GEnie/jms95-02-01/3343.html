     Assuming that the panel has not yet taken place, please take this with
you and read it at the panel.

     Ahem.

     Actually, I have nothing to say, I haven't heard anything from J. Michael
Straczynski, I'm making this all up.  No, really.  I made up the part about
having a message from him.

     But if I actually HAD a message from J. Michael Straczynski, it would
probably say this: Babylon 5 has most emphatically NOT been canceled.  Our
ratings continue to improve slightly from one quarter to another, and our
demographics are nothing less than appropriately stellar.  Nothing will be
decided firmly until late April or early May, but we have real hopes for being
renewed.  Last year at this time I put the odds of renewal at 50/50; I now
place them closer to 65/35, maybe even 70/30.

     54-40 or fight.  Tippecanoe and Tyler, Too.  Bibble-bibble wah, bibble
wah wah bibble.

     That's where the message ends.  I'd just like to add a personal comment,
thanking J. Michael for clearing this up for us, and that I'll be modeling the
lace teddy I'm wearing beneath my clothes in the  Elmtree tomorrow at one
o'clock.  I would also like to know why no one on the panel looks like Ivanova
except the gentleman on the left.  And please stop that, we can see you.  I
also predict that when I sit down the entire room will burst out in applause
and laughter.

     Thank you.

     No, I'm not sitting yet.  This was only a drill.  If I were actually
sitting, I would not be quite this tall.

     Is it cold in here, or is it just me?

     Thank you for your patience.

     I'm still not done yet.

     Yes, you are.

     No, I'm not.

     I absolutely, positively, cagetorically and enthusiastically REFUSE to
sit down.

                                                                  (sit)

                                                                        jms
