     Actually, what the Knight said was, "Maybe you're still inside; maybe
we're *both* still inside."

     Some tie-ins...remember Sheridan in "A Distant Star" saying that he was
feeling beached, abandoned?  His unsureness in taking on this post, what if it
was a mistake?  A number of his actions come into a clearer light once you
know he was in essence checking them all out, and putting on a hard "I'm a
nice guy" attitude.

     Also, I noted somewhere in a preview for upcoming episodes, among the
things coming, "conspiracies of light as well as dark."  Perhaps that is now
clearer.

                                                                 jms
