     A bit of new info....

     Not long ago, we decided to change prosthetics companies, not for any
problem with the first company, they did terrific work, but because we wanted
to go for more than they were really set up to handle.  We went over to
another group that has a long history of great prosthetics, and have been
working with them in designing stuff.  And for those of you who have been
asking for more than funny foreheads...you're going to get it bigtime.  They
are absolutely pushing the envelope in terms of the size, the scale, and the
complexity of prosthetics.

     Also the number involved.  We're making anywhere from 5-8 background and
guest Minbari, and equal numbers of Narns and Centauri, plus on top of THAT,
multiples of other alien groups.  So from now on, you won't just see singles
of any race, you'll see multiples.  Each different.

     And I saw a little something today that'll scare the hell out of you.
 Our prosthetics people have absolutely outdone themselves.  No one has ever
done anything on the scale they're doing, not for television.

     We've got one of George Lucas' favorite storyboarders lined up to do our
EFX storyboards, and a few more conceptual artists to draft some of our more
alien technologies.

     This show is going to have an *amazing* look to it....
