     Just wrapped another episode today, and tomorrow we begin work on
"Midnight on the Firing Line."  This one also has all of our major ambassadors
-- Kosh, Delenn, Londo and G'Kar -- as well as Lond's new aide, Vir, played by
Stephen Furst.  In this episode, you will hear Kosh speak for the first
time...and what he says may not bode well for B5.

     G'Kar's makeup has been greatly refined, and now looks like real skin;
it's very eerie.  Also, "Midnight" will have as much as 5 minutes of
CGI...basically, it has 60% as much CGI as was used in the entire pilot, all
of it new stuff.

     There's a great excitement on the set that hasn't diminished now that
we've been rolling for a while; every finished episode is met with applause
and high-fiving and the like.  The director who just finished is Jim Johnston,
who's a very highly regarded actor, an award winner, who is VERY good with
actors.  Also signed to direct, starting with "And the Sky Full of Stars," is
Janet Greek, who did a lot of Northern Exposures, among other shows, and is a
*stone* SF fan.

     We're shooting on a lot of new sets never seen in the pilot, so we have
all the breaking-in required of a new (and sometimes very complex) set...but
the result should be a locale that looks even larger and more city-like than
the pilot.  If you saw the last ST movie, you'll recognize the lead of one of
the shows we just finished: Morgan Shepherd, who was the warden of the prison
planet Kirk and McCoy were sent to.  He's a fine actor who brought a regal
touch to the episode.

                                                                jms
