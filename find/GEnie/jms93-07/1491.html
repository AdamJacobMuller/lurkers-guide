     I got bumped by one of those damned computer phone calling thingies, so I
didn't get all of the message I think, but what I can remember to reply to:

     There are more aliens than just the 5 major groups.  In addition to them,
there's *bunches* of oththe classification of the League of Non-Aligned
Worlds.  The Big Five constitute what is in  essence the Security Counsel,
while the rest are the General Assembly.  We will see these groups
participating in that capacity in "Midnight."

     In the reception scene for Kosh, at the bay, Garibaldi says that the
"others" are waiting down the hall.  That would include everyone, plus the
ambassadors, except Londo, who he specifies.

     The encounter suit opened at the touch of a button (you can hear him
press the button with a *click*).  Only for Lyta did it open on its own.

     All psi corps members must wear their symbol whenever they are out among
non-PC members.  That's the law.

     For the record...thtch has something to do with the second trial scene.

                                                                     jms
