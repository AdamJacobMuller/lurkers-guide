     Larry has designed a number of games, some way back when he was working
for Flying Buffalo, but his most well-known games were for (and are still
available from) Chaosium.  He worked on "Call of Cthulhu," he wrote (or co-
wrote) "Masks of Nyarlathotep," "The Grey Knight" and a bunch of others.
