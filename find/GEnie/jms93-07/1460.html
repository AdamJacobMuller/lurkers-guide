     Except that most combat of that nature would be to protect something,
usually in close proximity, such as a colony or planet.  Also, bear in mind
that a ship or convoy of ships in hyperspace can be anywhere, can go anywhere.
Once they exit hyperspace, particularly if they have to travel any real
distance, are more vulnerable because they're caught having to operate at sub-
light speeds.  So if you're going to hit them, best to wait until they're out
of hyperspace, which they have to leave sooner or later because part of
warfare is hitting targets...and most targets of real value are outside
hyperspace.  (Which is why carriers, capable of making their own jump points,
are of greatest strategic value.)
