     The alterations in cast didn't affect the scripts very much, since while
the through-line for the series has long ago been worked out, the individual
scripts didn't start getting written until after we'd made our decisions.

     What's great so far about the scripts is that they all have a point of
view, but they're not didactic or preachy about it.  (And sometimes the point
of view isn't what you'd expect it to be.)  We're definitely going to take on
some difficult issues here.


moment in a script where Londo is talking about homeworld, where marriages are
still arranged, to someone who doesn't want any part of that life.  "Here," he
says, pointing to three photos, "these are my three wives: Pestilence, Famine
and Death.  You think I married them for their personalities?  Their
personalities could shatter entire *planets*.
 Arranged marriages, every one.  But it worked out.  They inspire me.
Knowing they're at home, waiting for me, is what keeps me here, 75 light years
away...."
