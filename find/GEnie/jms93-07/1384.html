     I'll be able to say more about casting over this coming weekend.

     The pilot movie should be rerun in, I think, November.

     A TV Guide blurb for Episode One would be...telling too much at this
early stage of the game.  This, again, is my dilemma...I want to keep the
dialogue going, but some things we just have to sit on for the time being.
Not until airdate, certainly; but not this quickly.  Basically, as time goes
on, I will be able to talk more as we go, because then we'll be in a position
where no one else can jump on the bandwagon.

     All I can say about episode one is to say that it has Narn warships, lots
of action, some surprising character revelations, several people who want to
kill each other, a foretelling of things yet to happen, and the introduction
of some new characters.

                                                                    jms
