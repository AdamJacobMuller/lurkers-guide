     Yes, there will be a Confrancisco presentation on B5..two, actually.

There will be new footage spread across both days, and there may be an extra
guest or two at the 4:00 panel.  Can't promise that at this time, but it's a
possibility.

     Thinking back on San Diego Comic Con, something comes to mind that I
wanted to mention.  When I'm doing my number at a con, I kind of glaze over a
bit; I get mentally pointed toward performance, and things that would normally
be obvious get missed.  Thus...if you're one of the regulart (regular) folk
around here, and you come up to me, *introduce yourselves*, because I rarely
read badges (at 6'4" it's tough sometimes), and even when I do I'm often too
stupid to put names and handles together.

                                                                  jms
