     Actually, at one point or another, just about *everyone* lied in the
course of the pilot...including Sinclair, who lied to G'Kar, and of course
Delenn lying to Sinclair in the Garden...and so on.

     Basically, I have this theory that there are five kinds of truth.  (This
is Joe's Theory of the Five Truths.)  There is the truth you tell to casual
strangers and acquaintances.  There is the truth you tell to your general
circle of friends and family members.  There is the truth you tell to only one
or two people in your entire life.  There is the truth you tell to yourself.
And finally, there is the truth that you do not admit even to yourself.  And
it's that fifth truth that provides some of the most interesting drama.....
