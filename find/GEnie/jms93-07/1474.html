     Matt: I like it when people lie in television, and we find out about it
over time.  The "lost colony" routine was one such.  At one point, Garibaldi
confronts Londo with this as reason for why he doesn't trust  the Centauri.
Londo shrugs it off as a "clerical error."  There will be a few points in the
series when we'll get information, and we'll buy into it...and discover after
a while that that character bald-facedly lied to the other character (and, by
proxy, to us).  And naturally there will be consequences to this....

                                                                jms
