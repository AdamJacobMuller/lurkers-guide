     P.S.  Before I forget, someth8ingat the Con that I should mention here:
in deference to other opportunities which she felt were more promising, Pat
Tallman passed on returning to the B5 project.   Our new telepath will be
played by Andrea Thompson, with the character name Talia Winters.

                                                                  jms
