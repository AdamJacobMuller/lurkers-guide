     Actually, if you are talking specifically shows created for syndication,
the *first* one, and the one which blew open the doors for many other shows,
was "He Man and the Masters of the Universe," which was out around 1983.
Granted it's animation, but it *was* specifically produced for syndication,
and was very successful.

                                                                   jms
