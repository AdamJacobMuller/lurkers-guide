     Now, I didn't say she was a villain.  I said that certain things may or
may not have been done of her own free will, her own volition.  What this
means...we'll see.

     Will: to the concern you raise...my feeling is that, unlike Twin Peaks,
you *cannot* extend things indefinitely.  In other words, you don't have to
wait five years to find out what's going on now, in questions you have in
season one.  Questions raised in season one will be *answered* in season one.
It's just that, we hope, *new* questions will arise over the course of season
one that we can then answer in season two.  And so on.  I don't think it's
right, or fair, or smart to keep people on the hook that long.  Which is why
we'll find out what happened on the Battle of the Line midway through season
one...it's just what this then MEANS that will become the new question.

     As for managing to log on here...I wish I could do more, frankly, but the
press of time is astonishing.  It's the Lewis Carroll bit, you have to run
just as fast as you can to stay in one place.  If you don't, little details
begin to slip between the cracks...and in a story, and i television, details
are *everything*.  I think it was Michelangelo who said that "trifles make
perfection, and perfection is no trifle."

                                                                   jms
