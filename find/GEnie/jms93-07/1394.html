     Cameos was what I was NOT referring to.  For instance...with Walter, who
will be playing a character named Knight One in "And the Sky Full of Stars,"
he's there for the whole episode, and the character is very different from
what we've ever seen before...very dark.  And very strong.

                                                                jms*

     (*who did not do a cameo in the pilot, and definitely won't do any in the
series; this sort of thing should be left to professionals.)
