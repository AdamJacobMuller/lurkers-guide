     The main task was to get the telepath in trouble with the psi cops.
There's another way of doing that with Talia that's just as effective.

     What it *does* give me, which is kinda nice, is that the only two people
to have ANY direct contact with a Vorlon...have been transferred back to
Earth.  Which plays wonderfully into something sinister I'd kinda like to
develop that the Earth Alliance is working on behind the scenes....
