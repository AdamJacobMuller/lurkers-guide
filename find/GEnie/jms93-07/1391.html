     Here's something with which to occupy your time for a bit, while I'm
between things we can announce...one thing we're considering is bringing in
actors known to the SF genre elsewhere, or people known to SF who may not
necessarily be actors to do cameos, as opposed to featured roles.  An example
of the former (these are just my thoughts we have NOT contacted anyone, these
are examples *only*) would be someone like Mark Hammil, an example of the
latter would be Arthur Clarke.  If you had a wish list, of just one or two
people (to keep it from becoming a flood) you'd like to see in B5, what would
they be?
