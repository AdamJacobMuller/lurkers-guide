     Wonderful stuff...and the funny thing is, 1) "spoo" is actually a word
used in episode #1, and 2) I've been looking for another word to describe
flashing lights in production meetings (right now we're using "nernies" for
shorthand) and "derblinkens" sounds like a good replacement.

                                                                 jms
