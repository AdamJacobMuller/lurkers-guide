     Alan: sure, go ahead.

     I actually don't *have* a .gif of the SW logo.  I must remember to put
that on my list of things to do....

     As for "season finale cliffhangers," that depends on how you define that.
If you mean a cliffhanger that, once resolved at the start of the next season,
ends up having been more or less meaningless...no, we won't be doing that.
But the end of each planned season will make a left turn designed to bring the
show in new directions that will have long-erm (or long-term) effects on all
of our characters.

     Whether it's a chapter ending in a book, or an act break in a TV series,
you build to a moment of change and transition, upping the stakes at each
turn.  That's how our season-enders are constructed.

                                                                   jms
