     Catherine Adair ended up with another gig, so we now have Ann Bruice, who
was tied in our decision for a costumer for the pilot, but in that case she
was busy on another project.  Now she's available, and she is doing *terrific*
work.  Just amazing stuff...her work on the Grey Council is particularly nice.

                                                                 jms
