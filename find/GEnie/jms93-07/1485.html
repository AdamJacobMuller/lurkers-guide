     If someone got it right, I would say so.

     The incoming starship only looks like it's going to hit the station
because you're not bearing in mind the perspective.  B5 is *huge*, almost four
miles long.  By the time the ship would get close enough to the station to hit
anything, it would look a *lot* smaller.  It's a matter of perspective; we're
not used to seeing things that size.

     As for laserdisks in 16:9 aspect ratio, you may get your wish, a lot
sooner than you think (for the series, in any event).  Well, at least not 5-10
years, anyway.

                                                                jms
