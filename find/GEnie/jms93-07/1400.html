     Tom: yup.

     While I was on Twilight Zone Mark III, Christy Marx did a story for us
that had a hard, tough ending (the episode was "Cat and Mouse").  An absolute
killer of an ending.  That's what this script is...it takes no prisoners.
It's very tough, a very hard episode.  And it's a killer emotionally.

                                                                  jms
