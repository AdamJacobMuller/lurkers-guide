     I really don't know, and wouldn't want to speak for our cast members.  I
imagine there will be different deals with different actors.  If I were asked,
I'd suggest that they avoid becoming monopolized by *any* one group, but that
really isn't my call to make.  That's between them and their agents.

                                                                   jms
