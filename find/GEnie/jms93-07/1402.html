     Hi, all, was out of state for a few days, just got back and am catching
up.  Re: story alterations in changing cast...won't be any.  The basic layout
remains the same, only a few small pieces get rearranged in terms of the
overall 5-year arc.  We get to the same place in the end.

     This is very much what happens in a novel, having written a few: y ou
start out with X characters, and at some point discover that you need to skew
things to or away from certain characters once you get into it.  Same thing
here.

     Still planning on using Copeland for the scoring, plus some of his people
to round out incidental music.  And yes, I worked on TZ 3 as a story editor,
and did a freelance episode for TZ 2.

                                                               jms
