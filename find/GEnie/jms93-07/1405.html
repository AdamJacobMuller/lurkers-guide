     Re: B5 and movement...no, it ain't going anywhere.  Nor will it.

     Re: panoramic Rama-like vistas...that's fine if you've got an unlimited
budget and can build on a huge scale for visual effect, but the reality is
that even in the future, there are budgets to be dealt with, and neat as the
view is, it's wasted space in many ways.  Form follows function; this place is
set up as a way station, which means you have to squeeze every possible inch
of useable space out of the place.  You have a few exceptions to that, such as
the Garden, but that's it.

                                                                   jms
