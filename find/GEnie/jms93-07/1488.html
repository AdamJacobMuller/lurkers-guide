     Nope.  As you'll see in the series, we've worked out the docking bay
stuff very clevely.  A ship enters dead center.  It is then taken and lowered
into one of a number of different bays deeper within the station (by deeper I
mean lower, more toward the hull).  That's how we can have a series of
different docking bays in the first place.

     There's a nifty CGI shot we'll be using at some point in the series where
you can see the entirety of the docking bay, with the various ships arrayed
inside.  Then there are the more secure bays areas, with restricted access, as
when Kosh arrived.

                                                                jms
