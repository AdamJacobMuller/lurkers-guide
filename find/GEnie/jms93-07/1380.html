     You still have to create some kind of wardrobe, you can't just have folks
show up in levi's and kill the color.

     As for Doug, he's my equal partner in the project.  Doug's been in the
business as long as there's *been* a business, once serving as head of MGM.
He was my producer on POWER, and he and I made a deal: he will never give me a
creative note on that series.  And he kept that promise.  If it came in long,
or short, or there was an effect we couldn't do, that was  one thing, but
creatively, he left me alone.  "I'm not a writer, that's your job," he said.
There are very few people in this town who'll deal straight with you, and
Doug's one of them.  So when I created B5, of all the choices available about
who to partner up with, Doug was on top of the list.  He handles most of the
business stuff, and I handle the creative stuff.  (Which isn't exactly true in
some ways; I have to get into some of the business, and he has to get into
some of the creative, but those are are general areas of expertise.)

     His name generally appears in books about the film business, and in one
of these books, it explains that when he was at MGM, his nickname was the
Rattlesnake...hence, Rattlesnake Productions.
