     Digger: yes, what you report is correct.  Also if we allow for some
Russian/American or Russian/English intermarrying, you could end up with Susan
Ivanova, with a middle name much as you indicate.  That's  also one of the
differences between an ethnic Russian, and a Russian born outside the country.
The first name on my birth certificate, and the first name I was referred by
colloquially within my family were very different for quite some time.

                                                                    jms
