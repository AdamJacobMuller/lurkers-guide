     In posting this info elsewhere, it occured to me that I didn't remember
if I'd mentioned it here or not.  So in case I didn't...I'm working it so that
real-time comes close to paralleling story-time in the series.  The events of
the series will pick up approximately six months after the events of the
pilot.  We'll have crossed into another year, so the first "year" in which the
series takes place is 2258, year two of the series (if we get that far) would
be 2259, and so on.

     "And the Sky Full of Stars" is, I think, going to be our biggest episode
of the first season, followed close behind by "Midnight on the Firing Line."
It's a very complex script, and it has a LOT of effects in it.  It's also our
most intense episode to date, since it deals with the Battle of the Line and
some of its after-effects.  Ron figures that this one episode will have more
CGI than the entire 2 hour movie.

     I've also seen some new storyboards for some of our action and CGI
sequences, and we're carrying through on the image of this place being BIG.
(Our main storyboarder was Lucas' main storyboarder for some time.)  Some of
the scenes are just breathtaking.  I keep looking at them and asking, "Are you
SURE we can do this?" and they tell me yes.  The scope of some of this stuff
is just incredible.

     And not only that, but I got my official B5 business cards in the other
day, which makes it all very real..."Executive Producer" and all that
jazz...though I can't help but think of Steve Martin calling out, "The new
phone books are here!  The new phone books are here!"

     It's all starting to get very exciting...and very real.

                                                                jms
