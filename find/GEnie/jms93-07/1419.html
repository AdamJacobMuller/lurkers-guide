     Well, I just saw a cut of the episode that's going to air second, the one
guest-starring Morgan Shepherd.  Oh, man...on the question of Did you learn
anything from the pilot...this thing *moves* like a sumbitch.   It's a very
unusual, very *creepy* episode in many ways.  And filled with character
stuff...and a good bit of background about some of our characters rendered in
active ways.  I'm really dying to see what people think of this one when it
airs.  It manages to take what would normally be considered a science
*fantasy* issue, and deal with it from a  science fiction perspective, without
compromising on the latter at all.   It's a very, *very* strong episode.

     Incidentally...as long as I'm here...an advisory.  We've got about as
much security as anyone can *have* on a stage...but as with TNG and other SF
shows, we've had our share of things suddenly vanishing.  We lost a biggie the
other day, swiped by someone.  As mentioned, we re-examined G'Kar's
makeup/prosthetic, and did some minor redesigning.  Prior to final approval, a
full-size (head and neck) sculpture was done, painstakingly hand-painted.
There's only the one.  And someone swiped it, right out of Doug Netter's
office, where it was hanging on the wall.  I couldn't even begin to tell you
how much it's worth; just the physical value alone would be considerable, let
alone collector's value.

     I'm putting this out here so that, if anyone here should see it at a
convention, or a dealer's room, you should know that it's stolen merchandise,
and should be reported to the police.  There's no chance of mistaking this for
something else, since there's literally only the one in existence.

                                                                   jms
