     Actually, my plan is to show a *lot* of what's happening back on Earth,
because that will tie into what happens on B5.  Social changes, politics,
religion, sports...again, this relates to one of the themes of B5 from my
point of view, the continuance of our species,the thread that connects our
past, our present and our future.  And again, that's something that'll become
fairly evisode on.
