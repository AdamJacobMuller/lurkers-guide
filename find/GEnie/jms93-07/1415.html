     Licensing is still in progress.  Haven't heard any firm info yet, but
apparently there's some interesting stuff cooking.

     We have a VERY long lead-time; we'll be delivering finished episodes
nearly 4 months before airdate in some cases.  This is not typical of much of
TV.  Also, where most series usually have, at best, 2-3 scripts on hand, we
now have 10 final scripts in hand, practically half the series, which gives us
mountains  of time in which to prep, making sure each episode is as good as
possible.

     What's very interesting is seeing how more than one director handles the
series, the different approaches they take.  Same for the writers we're using.
One thing that's fun for me as the creator of this thing is letting others
play in this universe; I like to be surprised, and from time to time one of
our writers will hit on something that never occured to me about our
characters, but which makes perfect sense.

     It's very hectic, but exciting.  The main thing is that you're just tired
all the time; I get to the stage early, which for me is between 9 and 10, and
I'm there until 8 p.m. minimum, sometimes later.  Today I didn't get home
until around 10:30.  I tend to try to lock myself in my office, because if I
stick my head out, there's always any number of people who want opinions or
decisions or need to know what was intended with one thing or another, because
they're dedicated to getting the show right, down to the smallest elements.
When I can, I try to get over to the stage, just to keep an eye on filming.
Now that everyone's had a chance to think about their characters, and do some
more work in that universe, the characters are *really* starting to come out,
as the actors become more familiar with their roles.  And they're starting to
add a lot from their own personalities as well.

     It is a hoot.

                                                                 jms
