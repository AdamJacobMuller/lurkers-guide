     Nope, I was nowhere in the pilot, not under makeup, not nohow, not no-
way.  Nor will I do so in the series.  That just ain't my thing.

     By the way, here's something interesting: an outline got turned in this
week for an episode which I won't identify just now.  Came in from one of our
writers, based on an assigned premise.  It's something you've never seen done
in ANY SF-TV series, and I don't think has ever been done in TV overall.  A
very daring little story.

     Word finally came back from our liaison with PTEN.  "Number one, this is
absolutely against the demographics on the show.  Number two, no studio or
network executive in his right *mind* would EVER approve this story in a
million years.  Number three...it's a hell of a story, I love it, let's do
it."

     This has been emblematic of our relationship with PTEN: they've left us
alone, and are trusting us in our storytelling.  We want to go right out to
the very edge, and they're letting us, which is wonderful.  They've been, and
continue to be, terrific to work with.

     If the end of this particular story doesn't absolutely floor you, nothing
will.

                                                                   jms
