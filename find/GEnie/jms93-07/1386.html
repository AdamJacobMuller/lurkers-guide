     Each new season will advance one year in story time, to parallel real
time, yes.

     We're getting a terrific list of guest stars who want to do the show,
including many well known to SF viewers.  I should be able to pass along some
of these names fairly soon, as we decide where and when to use them.

     Now that we've definitely decided that Delenn is female, we're in the
process of designing new costumes for her, some very exotic, but always in the
dignified Minbari style.  Her aide, Lennier, will have a very monk like look,
very subdued.

     We're also modifying the prosthetics a bit.  Again, because Delenn is
definitely female, we can use a little less in the way of heavy overlays on
the head and face to convey ile keeping the desired androgynous look.  This
lets us get the same basic image, but make a lighter and more easily applied
mask that will allow Mira greater degrees of comfort and free her up to act
without being hampered in any way.  We're also doing some minor modifications
to G'Kar's prosthetic, making the chin less squared, the mouth a little
broader, and the whole thing again easier to put on and take off.  It will
also look far more realistic; parts of it LOOKED like a prosthetic when you
got up close.

     It's one thing to throw heavy prosthetics on an actor who's only going to
wear it for the 4 weeks required for the pilot.  But to wear something day in
and day out for 22 episodes...you have to think about that.  Our own concern
was making it look even *better* for both of them, and we've found a way to do
that.

     Same with Londo.  We're going to re-create an entire new hairpiece that
will lay flatter and look better from the back, which I felt was one of its
drawbacks.  Also, we don't want to have Peter shave his head for the whole
series, as he did for the pilot, so we're coming up with a longer  prosthetic
that'll come all the way over the top of the head to the eyebrows, where we'll
blend it in unnoticeably.  This will make Peter's life just that much easier.

     As mentioned before, we learned an awful lot about how to do this show
because of the po implement what we learned to make every aspect, from
wardrobe to prosthetics to CGI right across the board, better than before.
The usual road in SF-TV is that you dump all your quality into the pilot, and
then the series is a bit less spiffy than the pilot, but by then you've got
your audience.  Here we want the series to be *substantially* and noticeably
BETTER than the pilot, and so far I think we're doing it.
