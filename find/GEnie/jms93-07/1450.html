     Actually, it's a script for a 4-hour miniseries written on spec, and
while there are currently about half a dozen people who want to buy it, I'm
sitting on it until I make some changes.  The problem is finding the time to
make those changes with B5 moving ahead.  At some point I hope to be able to
carve out just a couple of days to finish my revisions and get it out for the
proposed auction.

                                                                     jms
