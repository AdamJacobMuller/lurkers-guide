     What we did with the uniforms was to toughen them up a bit.  We took the
basic class-A uniform we used on the pilot, and retailored them for a better
fit.  Then we added leather to the right front panel, quite a bit of it
actually, from the middle of the chest about three-quarters of the way to the
arm.  Then replaced the waist section/belt, cuffs, collar and epaulets with
leather.  (The blue class-A's got brown leather; the olive class-A's got black
leather.)  We added burnished bronze clasps, rank insignia, and a REALLY cool
Earth Alliance belt-clasp to the base of the jacket.  I personally think it's
very attractive, and had my original class-A from the pilot (yes, I paid to
have one made for myself) altered to the new "look."
