     BTW, an upcoming issue of -- I believe -- Computer Graphics World due out
shortly has a cover done by Ron, using one of the new ships we'll be using in
one of our stories.  It's head-first into the ground near what looks like a
Mayan pyramid; the ground and pyramid have nothing to do with our show, btw,
only the ship.
