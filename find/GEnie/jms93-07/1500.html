     By the way...at the B5 presentation at San Diego Comic Con, there will
likely be more people than me on stage that afternoon.  Tentatively, it looks
like it'll be me, plus one or more of the following: Jerry Doyle, Michael
O'Hare, Harlan Ellison, and possibly Mira Furlan.

     Just in case anyone's interested....
