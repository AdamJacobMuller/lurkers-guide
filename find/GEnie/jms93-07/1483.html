     It was a dust being a very specific drug with very unusual properties.
We cut the sequence in which he tries to get on board the station, is caught,
takes a hostage and is taken down.  But when you cut a scene like that, you
still have to list the actors used in it.  Hence the credit deal.

     Here's the one thing that amazes me, speaking of seeing the pilot for the
gadzillionth time...there is one great big huge gaping visual
anomaly/inconsistency in the pilot that so far no one has noticed.  It's so
massive that when I first saw it, I just about fell out of my chair.   But the
director said "No one's ever gonna see it, no one's ever gonna notice it,
*trust* me on this."  I was absolutely convinced that he was wrong.
Apparently he was right.  At some point in the future I'll tell you what it
is...and when you see it, you're going to wonder how the hell you avoided
seeing it before, it's *that* big.  But not for a while yet.   (And the few
smaller things mentioned here...ain't it.)
