     As reward for the humor, here's what Kosh will *really* say, when he
utters the first words we hear.  He's on the Observation Dome, looking out
through the window as a ship passes overhead, the lights shining down at him
through a window.

     "Ahhh....beautiful."   Long beat as he looks around the place.  Then:
 "I will miss this...when it is gone."

     And then he exits, as Garibaldi mutters to Ivanova, "I *really* hate it
when he does that."

                                                                   jms
