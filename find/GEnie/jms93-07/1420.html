     Louise: thanks for the support.  There ain't much more to do now that
we're up and running, but the offer is appreciated.

     Re: airdates...no, even though we'll be delivering in September fully
completed episodes, this is part of a network, and networks debut their shows
in a group, en masse.  So we'll be on in January regardless.

     Just got back from Comic Con, so I'm a bit breathless now.  Will just
skim for a bit, and do more later.

                                                                      jms
