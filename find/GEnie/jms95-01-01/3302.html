     What's funny is that a number of Trek fans who put down B5 did so on the
basis that we used CGI, which Trek would NEVER do (and B&amp;P reinforced this
notion in their statements).  Except of course now they ARE going to
CGI...which in some ways levels the playing field.

     (Saw this on Internet a few minutes ago...don't hurt me, I'm just the
messenger, thought it was funny..."What's the difference between a Trekkie and
a Trekker?  Trekkers like B5.")

     Seen on a local BBS echo: "B5 IN 95!"
