     Richard Biggs will be at a convention this weekend in South Bend, though
only on Sunday (it's a creation con, I believe).

     Meanwhile, it looks like there's going to be a big convention in Chicago
come June with Michael O'Hare, Mira Furlan, Bill Mumy and me in addition to
the aforementioned Richard Biggs.

                                                                 jms
