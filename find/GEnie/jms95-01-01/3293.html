     Re: on-air stuff...honest to Kosh, folks, I'm not saying that to be
convinced otherwise, not trolling for rebuttals, my job here is to talk
straight with you.  Radio, I'm okay on; typing online, ditto.  But put me on
TeeVee, and it all goes straight to hell.  I'm convinced that every time I go
on, millions of little old lady fans of America's Most Wanted suddenly point
at the screen and start screaming, "THAT'S HIM!  THAT'S THE ONE!"

     These things should be left to professionals.
