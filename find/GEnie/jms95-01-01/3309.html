     Re: G'Kar...the politial assessment is more or less correct.  The Narn
idea of an ambassador isn't just someone who SPEAKS for his people, he
REPRESENTS his people on every level. (So the strain and pressure is quite
great.)  As such, he is the highest-ranking representative on B5; he is
responsible for taking care of the ceremonies of G'Quon, was appointed by the
Kha'Ri, and can only be removed by the Kha'Ri, or by direct physical
challenge.
