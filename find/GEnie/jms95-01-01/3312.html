     We've spoken to Mark, and he even came by the studio to visit.  (We
actually had a 3-way interpersonal crossover when Walter Koenig stopped by at
the same time; we had Star Trek, Star Wars and Babylon 5 main guys in the same
room at the same time.)  It's something we'd like to do one of these days.

                                                                jms
