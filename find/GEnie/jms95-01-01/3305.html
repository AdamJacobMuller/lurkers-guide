     I'm told it's hitting the stands this week.  Some places have already got
it.

     Well, turned in the first formal draft today of "In the Shadow of
Z'ha'dum," which means there are now only five scripts remaining to be
written.  These will pretty much all be jms scripts, since the continuity on
the last five-six episodes is going to be *very* tight.  There's an awful lot
of terrain to cover in those episodes, and we really have to start cranking
things.

     It's weird to be able to look down just a ways and already be able to see
the end of the second season when we haven't even aired episode seven yet.

                                                                 jms
