     Actually, when I saw the CNN spot, it mentioned among his credits "are
Scarecrow &amp; Mrs. King, and Babylon 5."

     We don't generally get ratings reports broken down by competing shows,
since it varies from town to town.

     I was story editor on TZ3, and wrote about 11 of the episodes.
