     So far, nobody's said boo to us from any agency that means a damn.   A
couple of watchdog organizations last year put us into the "most violent shows
on TV" top-ten, along with (get this) DS9 and Brisco County, but that's it.

     I would deep-six the show or walk off it if any pressure group tried to
change what we are, with official backing.  You cannot make with timidity a
show about courage.  I have no idea if it'll ever happen or not; I would hope
not.  On one level, if it does, it'll elevate our visibility and our ratings.
So hey, let 'em come.  And if the horse should be shot out from under us, be
assured that we will go down fighting tooth and nail.  There are only a very
few things in life that genuinely frighten me, and looking for a new job isn't
one of them.

                                                                    jms
