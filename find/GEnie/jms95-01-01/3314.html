     The 5 was specifically designed by John Iacovelli; the purpose, though
we've rarely ever used it, was to create a moving number with the two parts
interlocking...the round o part of the 5 swings around, and stops when the L
shaped top of the 5 drops into position, locking it into place.

                                                                   jms
