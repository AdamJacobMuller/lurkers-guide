     I know it *can* be done.  I just don't wanna do it.  It's my show an' I
don't hafta, and I can hold my breath until I turn blue, and...and...I don'
WANNA.

     (In adult voice now): If others are doing it, fine, let them do it.   I'm
telling a story for the most part about grownups.  Just because a thing CAN be
done doesn't mean it MUST be done.  And because it HAS been done so much, on
so many shows, I'd kinda like to keep this show free of that, for the most
part.

                                                                 jms
