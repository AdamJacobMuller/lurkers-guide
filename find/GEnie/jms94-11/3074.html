     I did not call her a pinhead, I called her friends pinheads.

     Jose: this has got nothing to do with slamming B5 or slamming Trek.   I'm
not defending B5 against a Trek slam, and I have no interest in defending
Trek.  I'm talking about the weird individual mindset that  can't see past
that.  Nowhere in  my message do I slam Trek, nor do I ask people to stop
comparing B5's quality to Trek's quality.  Your message has nothing to do with
the message that I wrote, or the topic.

     Y'know, I sit here, reading 500+ messages a day, some with the most rude,
snide, condescending, insulting content I've ever seen...nobody ever thinks
twice.  I get a little tired of the same attitude on the part of a few people,
leave one message, and suddenly I'm being taken to task.   If I'm upset, I
have a right to state that.  Jose, you have been pretty damned vicious, and
insulting in many of your messages.  Even when you find something positive to
say, you phrase it in an insulting way 99.9% of the time.  So please take your
lectures somewhere else.

     If Lynda's friends think Boxleitner is "doing" a James Kirk imitation,
consciously or otherwise, they are exactly what I stated: pinheads.  If that
doesn't sit well, if it isn't politically correct, I'm sorry, but I don't do
that.  It's simply one of the most breathtaking moronic things I've heard this
year.  If that hurts, I'm sorry, but it's true.  Should I sit here and pretend
it's not a stupid idea?  Everyone here is quite free with their opinion;
should I not be allowed equal freedom?  I spend half my time on various
systems biting back replies to some pretty mean spirited comments; I let them
slide.  Sometimes, though, something rises out of the background noise enough
that I have to notice it, and respond.

     Reality check: anybody who could conceivably believe, and tell others,
that an accomplished actor with successful series, and highly rated movies,
one of the most sought-after actors in Hollywood, would suddenly, one day,
turn around and start doing a William Shatner imitation in what is his lead
role in a series is simply out of his or her respective gourd.  I'm sorry if
that offends, but it's true.

                                                                  jms
