     I'm starting to get the impression that our pals at Modern Video may have
done it to us again; they are the company that also inserts the national
sponsors into the show prior to uplink, and I'm beginning to suspect that
somehow they clipped some acts at the last clear frame before the fadeout;
we're currently investigating.
