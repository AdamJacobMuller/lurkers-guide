     We're dedicated to improving all of these elements on a regular basis;
CGI, sets, directing, lighting, name it.

     The music will change every year, to get in sync with where the season is
going; the tone and tenor and mood will shift.

     Re: the narration...last year, Michael had the benefit of being able to
see the sequence prior to reading the narration, and reading with the images.
That was when we were shooting in July to air in January.  In this case,
shooting in August to air in November, Bruce had to wing it, without any
images for reference, just text.  Now that we've got the opening completed
(and we weren't satisfied with it or done tinkering with it until a few days
before delivery), we'll probably let him do it again with the visuals before
him, so he knows what he's reading to, since it'll have a *big* impact on how
he delivers the stuff.
