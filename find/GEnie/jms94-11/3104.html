     Dave: talk turkey all you want; what I said was that we would be seeing
Sinclair again *this season*.  I have been very careful NOT to specify when,
because I want it to come as a complete and total surprise; many folks assumed
it would be the first few, and stated such, and as is typical because this had
now been seen, speculated and commented upon, it was assumed that I'd said it.
Didn't.  Consequently, nothing has changed in plans, footage hasn't changed,
nada.
