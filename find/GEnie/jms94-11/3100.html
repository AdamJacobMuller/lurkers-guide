     Oh, I'm quite sure there was backup made of the data.  But step back for
a moment and ask what that entails, and will any of it stand up in ANY court
of law?  There's a difference between that which we knor or (make that know
or) believe, and that which we can prove.  Without the one most important
piece of all, Garibaldi's aide, the rest is speculative, inconclusive,
circumstantial and conjectural.
