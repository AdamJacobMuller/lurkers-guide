     The Hyperion was built before the EM war, and survived.

     The Agamemnon, a much superior ship, was built afterward.  Sheridan was
not commanding the Aggy during the war.  It's one of the best ships we've got,
almost the equivilent of an aircraft carrier or battleship, and it took a lot
of seniority and work to get it.
