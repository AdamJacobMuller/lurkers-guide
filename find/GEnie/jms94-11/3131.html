     Chats...calm down.  It's got nothing to do with the actor,and everything
to do with the characters.  You're talking apples and oranges.  It's nearly
traditional in SF that you stick in a kid genius, or a kid liability, and skew
the show towards kids (talking regulars here).  We won't do that.  Period.

                                                                  jms
