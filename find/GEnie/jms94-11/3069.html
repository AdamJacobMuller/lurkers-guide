     The voice of B5 is done by Haley, our script-person on the set.

     Re: the theme music...to me, one is neither worse nor better than the
other.  They're *different*, and meant to convey different moods and themes.
Each year it'll change.  This year was heavy on strings and brass; next year
it'll be heavy on percussion.  The main theme will be reinterpreted and
interpolated in different ways.  In the B5 universe, change is the only
constant.
