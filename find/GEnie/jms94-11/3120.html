     We're already on top of this.  At this point what it looks like we'll be
doing (having run some experiments and test runs) is to transfer all of our
composite shots/CGI to film, and recut the negative using the added
replacement footage.  We have to do this *anyway* to do the change back to the
original aspect ratio, so it's not that big a deal.  I think one reason ST
simply doesn't think it's worth the time is that they aren't shooting in HDTV
widescreen format *anyway*, so any changes to accomodate that format would be
of limited use anyway.
