     Also, this week's Comics Buyers Guide has the first of three Peter David
columns (long ones) about his experience on the set while we were shooting his
episode.

     On reading the first installment, next time maybe we'll just shoot
him....

     Re: LoSH...yeah, I agree.  But hell, nothing in the DC universe has been
the same for me since Byrne royally screwed over Superman.  I have the last
two issues of the original Supes books written by Alan Moore, and those for me
are the last issues of the real Superman.  Who this new guy is, I dunno....
