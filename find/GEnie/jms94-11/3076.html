     I've been called a hell of a lot worse on these nets, and here; including
a liar, untrustworthy, a shill, a sellout...please.  Pinhead?
 I don't think I'd even notice.

     Y'know what this reminds me of?  Ever play Whack-A-Mole?  I had this
image while I was shoving a carton of Kung Pao Chicken down my gullet prior to
getting back to the writing, of the Whack-A-Mole game, and for two years,
everybody whacks the mole, whack-whack-whack-whack-whack, and one day, the
mole -- with stuffing leaking out of his ears, one eye missing, nose hanging
on by a thread -- mutters, under its breath, "...pinhead"...and suddenly
everybody runs around screaming "EEK!  EEK!   Get it!  Get it!"
WHACK!WHACK!WHACK!WHACK!WHACK!

     Really stupid thing is, the mole was a volunteer.

     Ah, well...I knew the job was dangerous when I took it....
