     Shon'Kar.  Satai Delenn.  Frallis 12.  Ikarra.  Xon.  G'Quan.   G'Quan
Eth.  (Also, in Narn stuff in that episode, the other religion is G'Lan, and
the ship was the Tal'Quith.)  Jala.  Kha'Ri.  Shai Alyt (which is a title, not
a name; a commander of a ship absent the captain is just the Alyt).
