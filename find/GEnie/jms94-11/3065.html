     In fact, we just re-did the narration yesterday, now that we have the
visuals in hand, and it's MUCH improved.  And since we're re-dong (er, re-
doing) that part anyway, we had Ron re-do the faceplate pull back shot, which
I think is good, but can be better.  Now it is.

                                                                jms
