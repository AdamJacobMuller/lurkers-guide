     After the hassle last year with Kawasaki and Zima, I'm inclined NOT to do
brand names anymore.

     Re: split-screen...you end up seeing less of both in the final analysis.
It's TOO busy.  And either you put the name of the actor over one half of the
picture (meaning you squeeze it down, all the more so since the titles are
letterboxed, making them practically unreadable), or you spill them across the
two sides of the split screen which'll look real bad.

                                                               jms
