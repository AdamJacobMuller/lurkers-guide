     It's really a question of what would work in the real world.   Ivanova
doesn't have anywhere NEAR the experience needed to run a station like this;
it isn't given because somebody's a nice person, or because they know you;
it's based on rank, and experience, and she has neither at this juncture at a
level sufficient to command a major operation like this.  The ONLY reason that
Sinclair had it at Commander rank was that it was a condition of the Minbari
in funding the place.

     In ST, the actress who played Beverly Crusher felt she needed a chance to
show she could command, to be more featured, so they put her in command for an
episode.  It had nothing whatsoever to do with reality, just servicing the
cast.  I don't think that's appropriate; the moment you do that, you
compromise the reality of the program, and it's just a TeeVee show.

     And there's lots of other reasons why Sheridan is there; I'd say wait
until mid-season, after about episode 11 or so, and you'll learn some more of
them, and they might not be what you'd expect.

                                                                jms
