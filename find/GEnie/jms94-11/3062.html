     The stations were put on notice *by* Warners about the error made by
Modern Video, and told which one NOT to air.  This isn't between us and PTEN,
but a station thing.

     "Chrysalis" will be rerun in time, but don't offhand know when (my guess
would be sometime around Christmas/New Year).

                                                                    jms
