     They're all three the same style ships.  It was rendered on the darkish
side, because a real problem is how do you show a black ship against the black
of space?  Lately, though, Ron has come up with some rather nifty ways to get
light kicks and some specularity off the ships, which has the side effect of
making them look even MORE creepy.

                                                                jms
