      Just an update to stuff like ratings...and while the ratings continue to
 be strong, and build in the overnights, the demographics are improving at a
 buying commercials, this is very good news.

      Overall, B5 comes in #3 in ALL syndicated dramatic series, as opposed to
 talk shows and game shows, which are in a separate category and fill up the
 upper echelons of the syndie ratings.

      Here's the breakdown for one week:

                       M 18-34  M 18-49  M 25-54  W 18-34  W 18-49  W 25-54

 Highlander               1.4      1.5      1.6      1.9      2.0      2.1
 Thunder in Paradise      1.3      1.2      1.3      1.4      1.2      1.2

 High Tide                1.0      1.1      1.0      1.7      1.4      1.5
 Heaven Help Us           0.8      1.0      1.2      1.7      1.6      1.4
 Robin's Hoods            0.8      0.9      1.1      2.1      1.8      1.5

      Number 3 out of 17 dramatic series is VERY good placement, and PTEN is
 very encouraged by this, very pleased.  (You'll note a fairly big drop
between
 #3 and #4, while the difference between, say, 20 and 21 are not (is not) as
 substantial.

                                                                      jms
