     Negative; more passes than just a few minutes.  The reporter says that
they're sending rescue ships, but she doesn't see how anyone could have
survived an explosion that massive.  Then, considerably later, the death is
confirmed (it's not even in the same act).

     Also, *too* much power exerted at the outpost would've signalled
something terribly massive.  They don't want to tip too much, too fast.   They
want it to look like it was something others could've done.

                                                               jms
