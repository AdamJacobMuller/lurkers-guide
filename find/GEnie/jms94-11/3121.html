     "Ulysses" is available in most anthologies of Tennyson's work, and in
many anthologies of british verse.  It's just a lovely and moving piece of
work.

     Don't know where things currently stand re: HDTV out in the real
world...though I just bought a new IDTV set, so at least I'm starting to get
ready....
