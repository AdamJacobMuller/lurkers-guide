     Sure, you could blind-fire at a Minbari cruiser, but it's pretty heavily
armored.  And while you're shooting at it, you're not only being hit by
cruiser blasts, but the several dozen Minbari fighters coming in behind you.
And shooting at a sublight traveling fighter by eye would absolutely never
work.  It *has* to be computer guided.

     (BTW, for the sharp of eye...if you go back and sill-step through some of
the cockpit screen shots in "Sky," you'll note that on the tac screen in
Sinclair's cockpit it says something to the effect of "Unable to lock-onto
target.")
