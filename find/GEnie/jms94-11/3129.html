     Gary...whilst you're here...lemme ask you a question.  (And please don't
take this in any way requiring defense; I'm honestly curious about something
that you mentioned that others have mentioned, and I'm trying to wrap my brain
around this.)

     You say, "I avoided the early (B5) episodes."  This is something I hear a
lot, particularly in the mail I'm getting these days.  Many of them were ST
fans, but some didn't say one way or another.  Some of them simply avoided it,
some of them VEHEMENTLY avoided it, and some of them admitted to ripping the
hell out of the show simply on principle without ever having actually SEEN it.

     So what I'm curious about -- and again, please, there's no need to  feel
put upon by this, we're glad to have you -- is your statement; can you in any
way elaborate upon your feelings at the time, and why you avoided it?

                                                             jms
