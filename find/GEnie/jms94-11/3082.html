     Actually, I think the positronic brain/android brain was introduced in
TOS, as were replicators.

     BTW, I heard the other day about planned Mars observers and landers to be
launched every two years starting in '96, but haven't heard more about it
since.  Anybody got the skinny on this?

                                                                 jms
