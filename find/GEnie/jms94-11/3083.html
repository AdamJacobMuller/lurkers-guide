     What I found weird about the Mars thing was the comment from somebody at
NASA that they were sending the lander/observer missions in order to "learn
more about the patterns of extinction."  Which seemed an awfully odd comment,
and wasn't followed up on.  If a planet has ALWAYS been dead, then sending a
probe to look into patterns of extinction seems kinda pointless....

                                                                   jms
