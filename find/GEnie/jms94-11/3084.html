     Arne: I generally don't let the actors know what's coming unless it's
important to the current performance.  Otherwise you risk having the actor
play the *result* instead of the *process*.  Had to make one divergence from
this recently, so that Peter could understand better a sequence in "The Coming
of Shadows," which you'll understand when you see it.

                                                                  jms
