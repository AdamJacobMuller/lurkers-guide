     Yes, Ivanova's title in the opening credits *will* be changed to
Commander, to reflect her change in rank.  And we'll be adding a rank for Lt.
Keffer.  It's kind of funny; we keep treating the opening title this year as a
work in progress, reflecting little changes here and there...changes in faces,
narration, little musical changes that will come by about episode five or
six.....
