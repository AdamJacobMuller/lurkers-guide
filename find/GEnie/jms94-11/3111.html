     Re: Na'Toth...you have to remember this was not our decision, but rather
Caitlin's, in order to pursue some romantic lead parts.  We made an offer
equal to the other cast, but she opted out to pursue films.  We cast the best
actor to come in the door to fill Na'Toth's boots, and we need that character
there because of the prior knowledge she needs to have to fill her role in the
story.  Mary Kay is, I think, trying to reinterpret the character.  We're
nudging in the other direction.  One way or another, this will be made to
work.
