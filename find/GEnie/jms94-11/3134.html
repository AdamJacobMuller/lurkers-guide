     No rubber stamp deals have been made.  (Oh, nearly forgot, there's a
MicroGames hand-held B5 game that should be out shortly, if not already out.
It's one of those noisy LCD screen jobbies, where you use B5 to collect
damaged ships.  It doesn't fire at the incoming enemy (Vorlons), because a)
that's a very bad idea with Vorlons, and b) given that kids are the primary
audience for this stuff, I didn't want a shoot-em-up.)
