     Elissa: I think your analysis is quite good.

     Doc: actually, funny thing is, I'd say about half of the message I see
(make that messageS) are from folks either directly or indirectly involved
with real space...from NASA, from JPL, the High Altitude Observatory, various
space science research organizations...so I'm sure this aspect will come in
time.

     Some rather astonished reactions at the studio today to a just published
script...lots of folks found out somebody isn't entirely who they've been
assuming.  I love doing this....

                                                                jms
