     Actually, that kind of dedication and attention is really only required
if you're trying to figure out what's going to happen BEFORE it happens, which
is primarily a thing on the nets.  Most folks non-wired in seem content to see
what happens WHEN it happens...and there, *all* of the information needed to
follow it is always provided in the episode in question.  (You don't need to
have seen "Quality" to understand what the healing machine was, and what it
was designed to do, for instance, in "Points."  Franklin recaps that info for
the viewer.)  One person, just as an experiment, watched the episodes
completely out of order, and found that he could follow it just fine either
way.

     On an unrelated note...just finished another script tonight, "Acts of
Sacrifice," which despite its rather ominous title is more a slice of life
episode...and contains probably the funkiest, weirdest sequence that I have
ever written.  Full tilt whacko.

                                                                 jms
