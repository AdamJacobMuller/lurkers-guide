     BTW, having now edited seven episodes, and seen several finished ones, I
think that of the first three, "The Geometry of Shadows" (#3) is my personal
favorite.  "Revelations" is certainly a biggie, a staggering chunk of the
arc...but "Geometry" is just an absolute hoot, something of a breather from
the intensity, and largely for fun with some undertones.   If you liked "The
Parliament of Dreams," you'll probably love "Geometry."
