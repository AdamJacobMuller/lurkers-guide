     ...intellidrivel?  What an interesting new word.

     One of the things we've noticed at the B5 offices, from mail from folks
and in some cases teachers (not that they're different), is that we seem to be
cutting across all age groups.  A *lot* of kids are hooked on the show.  But
we also seem to be getting the old-time SF types, and seem to be drawing more
or less equally from print and media SF fans (though, curiously, slightly more
from those who consider themselves print SF fans than media SF fans).

     BTW, late notice...there will probably be a B5 piece on EXTRA tonight.

                                                                   jms
