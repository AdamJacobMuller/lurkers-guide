     Actually, G'Kar's makeup wasn't changed this year; the actor put on a few
pounds over hiatus, which shows in the face, which changes how the prosthetic
looks.  This was dropped very quickly by Andreas, however, and the makeup has
adjusted itself.  (Hell, we all put on a few pounds during hiatus.)
