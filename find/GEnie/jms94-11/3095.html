     Well, in today's Variety, B5 climbed back into the top 20 again, and the
third highest dramatic series overall (not counting the Action Pack, since
it's a movie each week).  DS9, Baywatch, B5, then everything else.   We're
hanging in there.

     (These are, again the syndicated ratings, not the network ratings.)

                                                                     jms
