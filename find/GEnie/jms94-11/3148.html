     The Narn aren't waiting.  Or, more accurately, G'Kar isn't.  The rest of
the Kha'Ri (Narn inner circle government) are still somewhat skeptical.

     The Minbari know the shape of what's coming, but they know full well that
if they go to us with this, we won't believe them; there's still enough
residual dislike over the war that they feel we have to find this out for
ourselves (and we will).

                                                                  jms
