     Depends on what you mean by "just visiting."  If someone comes on board,
and we feature him or her, and this person just sorta wanders around without
ever interacting with our characters...I don't think that would be terribly
dramatic.  We do have some shows with people who come to see our main
characters, interact with them, and then leave again.   A basic visit.
