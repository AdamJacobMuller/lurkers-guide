     Quick note...I *may* be doing a one-hour presentation at the Creation
convention later this month in Pasadena.  This is contingent, thouugh, upon
the scheduled appearance being put back a bit, since I'll be flying in from
Houston that morning.  The Space Frontier Foundation is giving us an award for
Best Vision of the Future.  (They're also giving an award to astronaut Pete
Conrad that night, and want me to present it.)

                                                                  jms
