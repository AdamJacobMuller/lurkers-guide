     We'll definitely see Bester again, probably twice next season, in one
capacity or another.  (And we'll *hear* about him once more this season.)

     Re: the CD-Rom...we're planning some very cool stuff.  I've indicated on
all pending licensing deals that I don't want them to be just one more media
tie-in; they should have some independent value.  So in this case, I really
want to use it to de-mysticize what television is, and how it's produced.
Something for educational purposes.  So we'll track how the process is done,
by taking a micro-example: from concept, to a scene in a script, to costume
designs, production/set design, storyboards prosthetics, filming, editing,
scoring and mixing.  As a culmination of this, there will be 5-7 brief dailies
shosts, all from the same scene.   The job then is for the user to edit these
dailies (establishing shot, medium close-up, close-ups, inserts and the like)
into a *scene*.  You can literally see the dozens of ways you can create a
scene from the same footage.  You can then play it back, possibly with some
music, and see how it works...then play back the real scene as we did it, and
compare and contrast.

                                                                      jms
