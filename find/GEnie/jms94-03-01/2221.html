     Will: it's very hard to answer that question without specifics; it does
make me a touch nervous, but at the same time, it doesn't seem correct or
proper to stop the kind of speculation you suggest, since the show is *bound*
to elicit such speculations by its very construction.

     I dunno...so I'll leave it to the quiet turning of your own considered
conscience.

     Re: the cast...they're simply pleased and flattered and moved by the
attention on-line.

     Re: "Sky"...my theory is to *never* assume prior knowledge of the
background info that goes into an episode.  If you never saw the pilot, you
will miss *nothing* going into "Sky" (though it'd be nice because of one
quickie flashback to know where that came from).  I don't think anyone will
have a hard time following that one.

     Re: the core shuttle...yes, the exterior was all CGI.

                                                                jms
