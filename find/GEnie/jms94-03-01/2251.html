     Mmmmm...lemme see...I don't think there *are* any more "former lovers"
stories coming in for pretty much the rest of the season; there's an
acquaintance who comes back, and a reference to a prior relationship (but it's
not on the station, and doesn't take place there), but that's it.  No more
former lovers coming to the station this season, that I can think of.

     (Is weird that the ones we *did* have got grouped like that; hadn't
noticed until now.)

                                                                 jms
