     Correct; the gates themselves are complex, extremely so, but they are
limited in production mainly by available amounts of Q40.  (Also, in most
cases, a gate is a gate is a gate; there's not much difference between them
visually.)

     And in the case of Sigma 957, one can put in a gate, start to explore
that sector of space...and discover to your chagrin that there is one planet
where you don't dare go near.  It's not like they *knew* that there was a
problem on Sigma 957 before they (the Narns) put the gate in; that was
discovered only afterward.  Sort of like buying a house and then discovering
that one room is haunted; you seal off the room and tell the kids not to go
near it.

                                                                jms
