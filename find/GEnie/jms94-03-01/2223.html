     Some notes:

     "A Voice in the Wilderness" is just written by me, not me and Larry
(either part), and is directed by Janet Greek.

     "Eyes" to be directed by Jim Johnston.

     Jim did not direct "The Quality of Mercy."  It was one of our new
directors...and her name has *just* fallen out of my head this moment.   Will
post it tomorrow.

     "TKO" was directed by John Flynn.

     "Deathwalker" was directed by Bruce Seth Green.

     "Grail" and "War Prayer" directed by Richard Compton.

     (Also "Believers" was directed by Compton.)
