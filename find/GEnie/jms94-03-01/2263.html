     Tony: yes, that ambiguity is something to consider.  I like ambiguity.
 I think.

     Yes, it was supposed to be closed-captioned, and there was a glitch after
we'd turned in the episode.  It'll be captioned for later broadcasts.  (BTW,
those who taped MW...I suggest you keep your tapes; there will be a subtle but
definite difference in one shot in all later airings of the show after this
next rerun.  And no, I'm not going to tell you what it is...but any copies of
the first version will probably be a rarity.)

     The core shuttle has hand-holds on the seats, and on the walls and other
areas.  They were both holding onto the lower hand-rails, though it can't be
seen in that shot.  It *is* visible in other episodes.

     A Rubik's Cube is a *very* good metaphor.

     The vaporized Starfuries *weren't* from B5, they were a separate wing not
attached to this station.  Black Omega is a special forces unit.

     "Believers" isn't next; up now comes "The War Prayer" by D.C. Fontana
(okay, despite some problems, mainly in direction), then "Sky."

     The Soul Hunter was hit by a PPG, but not terribly slowed; you'll see
others hit and harmed or killed by PPG down the road.

     (Actually, you'll see it in "Sky."

     Re: my favorite thing about this episode...it's that when all is said and
done, *nobody knows anything*.  Bester doesn't know what Ironheart is turning
into; Sinclair doesn't know if Ironheart was really telling the truth or not;
nobody knows where Ironheart went; nobody knows what the alien ship is/who
they were...the closest I can come to is to compare it to writing a mystery
novel, without revealing the killer, but *without* frustrating anyone in the
process, because there's *closure*.

     In so much of TV SF, *everything* has to be explained, often explained to
death.  I just love that in the B5 universe, it's okay for there to be
mysteries and wonders and the unexplained.

                                                               jms
