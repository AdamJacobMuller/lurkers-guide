     Overall, I'd say that "Legacies" came out better than "War Prayer,"
because Dorothy had more time to get to know the characters, and because it
was better directed.  (As a parenthetical, Larry DiTillio has developed some
of his own scripts as well, specifically "TKO" and "Eyes."  "Legacies" is the
one I'd say was developed "outside the office" in the sense of being a
freelance effort.  Everything else was either an assigned premise or done in-
house by staff.)
