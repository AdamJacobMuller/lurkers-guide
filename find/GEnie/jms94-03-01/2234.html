     There's still an *awful* lot of ground to cover in a war this big.

     Also, check the readout on Sinclair's screen as he's trying to engage the
enemy.  You'll see "negative lock" popping up.  One problem in fighting the
Minbari vessels is that they have a kind of stealth tech that makes it very
hard for our weapons to lock on.

                                                                  jms
