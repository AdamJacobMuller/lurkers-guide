     Just a reminder to all and sundry in the LA area...our Conceptual
Consultant, Harlan Ellison, will be signing his new collaboration at Forbidden
Planet Bookstore on April 2nd from 2-4 p.m. (corner Van Nuys and Ventura,
Sherman Oaks).

     Funny aside...on Friday, my accountant and his 10 year old son came by
the set for a tour.  His son was wog-boggled by everything.  At one point in
the filming, Michael O'Hare came over and struck up a conversation with the
kid.  The kid asked what that thing is on the back of Sinclair's hand.
"That's my communications device," O'Hare said.  The kid looked chagrined,
glanced around, whispered to Michael to lean down, and explained -- to save
Michael further embarrassment in future -- that the communicator was on his
*chest*.

     I would give my soul for a photograph of Michael's face at that moment.

                                                                jms
