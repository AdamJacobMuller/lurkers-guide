     Two quickies, before I forget (again):

     1) Yes, to the pain in the butt who inquired, I bought the Quantum
bowling ball, and it probably won't bowl any better, but I'm a stooge, and
there we are.

     2) I've nudged (gently) Christy Marx about the newsletter (as has the
effervescent Katherine Lawrence) (and did you effer know her when she
effervasn't?), and Ms. Marx and Ms. Drennan are now focusing in on getting the
next issue out, which will be a double-issue, twice as big, with more
interviews, probably a schedule for the full season, and other goodies.

     Amazing what a friendly smile, a soft-spoken request, and a meat axe can
achieve....

                                                                   jms
