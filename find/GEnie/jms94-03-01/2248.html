     There's a Billy Joel song, where one particular lyric (and I'm quoting
from memory) says, "You still have a pain inside you / That you carry with a
certain pride / It's the only part / Of a broken heart / You could ever save."
That's Ivanova.

     She's had her heart stomped on a lot.  And she's been holding it in.
Even with her father's death, she sucked in the pain, fought back the tears.
There is one episode, which will be right at the end of the year, where she
finds she can't run from her pain anymore...can't run from the tears...and
deals with them in a scene that's very moving and absolutely brings tears to
the eyes.
