     No, "Eyes" is a new script unto itself.  We're retitling "Raiding Party"
(which I always figured was a working title, too prosaic) to "Signs and
Portents."  Figured it'd be nice to have one episode title per (projected)
year carrying the year-arc title.

     BTW, Compton's has signed to do a CD Rom of the Babylon 5 Universe, which
is going to be VERY comprehensive...all the alien races, including the League
of Non-aligned Worlds, background on the war, dictionaries, other reference
stuff, you name it; it'll also be able to take advantage of the latest voice-
recognition software, so you can run it exactly as the B5 computer is run.
("Computer, language search, "Satai.")  There will even be some original CG
and live-stuff shot for it.  It should be a killer CD Rom.  (Now if only I
could get my system up and running....)

                                                                jms
