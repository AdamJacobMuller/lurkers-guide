     It's easy; hit her while she's asleep....

     BTW, we managed to track down and correct about 50% of the problems in
video and audio that took place after we'd been delivering episodes, and so
this and all subsequent episodes should look cleaner and sound a bit sharper,
staring with "War Prayer."  Anyone else noticing this?

     Also, just as an aside...was talking to someone today about how
extraordinary a cast this is in terms of sheer intelligence; Michael O'Hare
attended Harvard; Claudia is a Mensa member (genius IQ); Jerry is a financial
wizard...they're all extremely sharp people, nowhere near the stereotype so
many people have of actors.

                                                                jms
