     There's very little about one can say about "TWP" that I wouldn't respond
to with, "Yup."  Dorothy did a bangup job on the script, but so much gets lost
in translation sometimes.  All added up, there are only three episodes this
season that, for me, aren't up to the rest: this one, "Infection," and
"Grail."  That there are only 3 out of 22 is extremely good for ANY TV series.
(And again, that's only my POV; I know that there are a number of people who
liked this show, liked "Infection," andf will likely approve of "Grail."
Tastes vary.  I'm just very, very hard on *all* of our episodes.  I think you
have to look at your own work with as baleful an eye as possible.)
