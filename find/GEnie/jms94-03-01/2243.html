     We actually had a lot more shots we could've used to prolong the
sequence, but felt we *really* had to get to Sinclair, and go into his point
of view more.  Also we step-printed the CGI to give it a more dream-like
appearance, since we're seeing this from inside Sinclair's memory, and he
wasn't really able to *see* all this, particularly stuff happening around and
behind him, this is more his *sense* of the events of that time.  The sections
we didn't step-print were those where he was RIGHT THERE, to make a subtle
distinction.
