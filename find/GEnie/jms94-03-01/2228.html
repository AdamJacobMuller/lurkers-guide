     This was one segment of the battle; there were others going on in other
areas as well.  It's said that no one ever *saw* the Battle of the Bulge; each
saw a small part of it.  Same here.

     Reality is, no matter how big we would've made it, more would've been
wanted.  (If anything, it seems that the more we show, the more is wanted.)
But all things considered, best to have folks wanting more than wanting
less....

     (And remember, we're managing to do all this with roughly *half* of TNG's
budget.  Give us their budget, and I'll show you ALL of the Battle of the
Line, and the ENTIRE Earth/Minbari War, PLUS all their home worlds.)

     Nonetheless, as we go deeper into the season, the CGI/action sequences do
get bigger and more detailed in many places.  In "Signs and Portents"
(formerly "Raiding Party"), you'll see three pretty good sized squadrons of
ships engaged in a very fast-paced battle that goes on for most of an act and
a half, as opposed to just a few scenes in "Sky."  Big battles weren't really
the *point* in "Sky," it was more about his REACTIONS and his personal fate.
There were a number of action/battle shots we had on hand, but decided not to
use because we didn't want to dilute the *point* of the scene.

     And as stated elsewhere...yes, you'll be seeing the Minbari war
cruiser(s) again.
