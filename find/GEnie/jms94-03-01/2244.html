     The second shot to Knight One is a gut-shot, and the security guard is
shot through the chest.

     Bear in mind, also, that some of this may be expected by folks here on
the nets because of the ongoing conversations, speculation and the  bits of
info I drop here; but for 99.9% of the rest of the nation, this IS new info.
And even with the nets, I suspect that there are some surprises here....
