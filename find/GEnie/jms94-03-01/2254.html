     One of the things I like about the sets is that they're actually fairly
large, and we tend to go for lots of extras to help carry through that sense
of scale.  It's not uncommon for us to have anywhere from 50 to 90 extras in a
scene, just to fill it out.  One scene had as many as 200-250 extras; many
others have between 150-200.  This is a *busy* place, and should feel like it.

                                                                 jms
