     There is a side-button on the gun which arms it (the power whine you hear
when it's drawn).  It's just over the thumb.  Then the trigger is used to
discharge the built-up energy.  You can push or pull the trigger to your
heart's content if it's not armed and it won't fire.  It works as a kind of
safety; you have to do both or it won't fire.

                                                                  jms
