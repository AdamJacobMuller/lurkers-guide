     Having seen the ship rocked and buffetted by the passing ship, I figured
that it would be clear that this basically pushed it down, made its orbit
begin to detriorate.  Her ship was also riding *very* close to the edge of the
atmosphere.  Perhaps should've been clearer.

     Re: jumpgates...I knew that multiples were used, but was still working
out the *exact* details of how they work, and I hate to post anything until
I'm 100% set, since this stuff tends to end up in FAQs....
