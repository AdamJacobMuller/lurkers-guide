     For the Minbari, it's tee'la, which is a kind of poem-song, sort of.
Delenn was mainly just unfamiliar with the term.

     Yes, the two Harlan scripts are temporarily on hold, due to some health
problems earlier this season (two heart procedures), the quake and his
injuries there, and other stuff.  He has, however, served very well as our
consultant, and it has been more than worthwhile.  His health permitting, we
hope to continue the relationship in future.
