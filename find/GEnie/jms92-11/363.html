      I don't care about revenge.  Not interested in it, frankly.  All that
matters is the work.  Which is why, despite the timing on the E.W.
article...to me, it doesn't matter.  I've said it before, I said it at
Wishcon, and I'll say it again here: if DS9 and B5 are both around and healthy
and successful 5 years from now, that's terrific.  The world is big enough to
support more than one view of the future.  That's the whole notion behind B5,
that SF fans, after 25 years, might like another view of a spacefaring mankind
in the future.  So the flip side is also true; the more the merrier.

     I should mention that if I kept a low profile at Wishcon, it wasn't for
lack of ambition.  On Friday, I flew out in the morning, and due to a plane
going nonfunctional at the boarding gate in DFW, didn't change to another
plane for a long time, and thus didn't arrive in Springfield until around
11:30 or thereabouts.  Planes just beat the crap out of me physically, so I
crashed.  Didn't adjust well to the time difference, and what with being
nervous about the presentation, and then the 90-minute "town meeting"
afterward, was just gonesville.  Next time, I hope to be more amiable...and
closer to home.

     I didn't blush at the ovation, did I?  Really?  I *hate* it when that
happens.  I have a very low blush threshold, and it is constantly a sore
point.  Ah, well...(embarrassed sigh).

                                                                  jms
