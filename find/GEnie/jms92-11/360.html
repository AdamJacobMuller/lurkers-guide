     Don't know if WB will be sending any more promos, but I would guess that
they will.  Will advise if I hear about any more.

     Phil: I'm still going over the new material (25 pages?! single spaced?!
oh, man!), but insofar as I can tell, it looks fine.  I may add a bit here and
there, but overall, looks great.  And I'll be curious to hear your reactions
to the promo when you see it.

     This weekend, btw, I'll be at Wishcon (for those who don't yet know) to
talk about B5 and give a presentation.  If you know anyone who's going,
suggest they especially clear out Saturday early afternoon.  I've given
several B5 presentations, but I'm very much looking forward to this one.

                                                                 jms
