     We're going to make the EFX of the guns move as fast as possible, to
match even slightly the real speed that would be involved (which in complete
reality would probably be too fast even to see, but one does what one can).

     We've also tried to be fairly rigorous on the question of security.   On
other shows, they only call up security guys when there's a problem.   If you
watch the pilot, there are about 7 or 8 security people at the customs
scanner, and you *constantly* see them moving down the corridor or through the
bazaar...armed.  Not a big presence, but as you say, with 4 other stations
lost or destroyed, you have to be careful.

                                                                 jms
