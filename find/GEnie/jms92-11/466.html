     BTW, for those in the L.A. area, in case you missed this in the top
topic, I'll be doing a B5 presentation at Loscon this coming Saturday
(Thanksgiving Weekend) from 4-6 p.m.  Not only will a lot of B5 stuff be
shown, but we will have (tentatively, at least) several others involved with
B5 present, possibly the director and one or two cast members.

     This may, or may not, be similar to the Wishcon presentation; I'll know
in the next 48 hours.

                                                                  jms
