     On the area of religion...basically, I'm an atheist.  But what has always
intrigued me is the range of methods people use to try and understand
themselves, the world, and the universe they inhabit.  If one is honest with
oneself, that has to include science, philosophy, and religion (among others).
I don't have to agree with the *conclusions* of any of them to nonetheless
respect the fact that for some people this is a very valid and important means
of Understanding.  (One of the best texts I've found on this is Durkheim's
"Elementary Forms of the Religious Life.")

     So yes, that has to be dealt with and explored.  What B5 is about (in
addition to a number of other things) is Asking The Next Question, whether
that's about living environments for the outside (alternate atmosphere
quarters, f'rinstance, for aliens) to different living environments for the
INside.  What *would* the reaction be if, upon making Contact, we found a
culture with a fascinating, involved, textured religion that had been around
for tens of thousands of years, proffered by a race well in advance of our
own?  If some science-fiction writer can come up with a system of belief on
his own time and sell it into one of this country's biggest money-making
franchises (and we all know of whom we speak), can you even imagine the impact
something like THIS would have?  You'd likely have converts by the bucket, as
well as a LOT of anger from the Terran religious community as backlash, as
they lost converts of their own (though in turn, they would likely make
converts among the aliens...can you imagine the controversy behind the
selection of the first Minbari pope?  I _ hey, wait a minute!  That ain't ba_
er....never mind.  Forget this conversation, it never took place.)

     In any event...he said, changing topics...Monday I get to do Show and
Tell with Stewart Copeland, and hear the majority of what he'll be doing for
the B5 soundtrack.  I'm *reallly* looking forward to this, and will give a
full report later.  I think we do the actual scoring session later this week
or the first part of next week.

                                                                jms
