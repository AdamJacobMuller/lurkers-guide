     I wonder sometimes if everyone has problems with their PR.  The E! piece
(which should show up every 3 hours or so for the next little while) was okay.
My main concern with it was that they concentrated on the
prosthetics/makeup/puppetry because that's easiest to do.  If I were at home
watching, having had no familiarity with the show, I don't think I would have
learned anything from this.  It was...cute.  I hate cute.
