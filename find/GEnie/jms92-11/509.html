     RE: sexual bigotry, or racial bigotry for that matter...you have to
understand the potential psychological consequences of contact with not just
one, but literally dozens of different species from a hundred worlds.   We are
singular in our heredity and our humanity, and I think that when you stop to
look at something 8 feet tall, with feathers, fangs and fur, coming down the
hall toward you, you have a LOT less of a problem with the person to your left
who happens to be of a different color or sexual persuasion.

     That doesn't mean that bigotry is going to disappear, however; lilke
religion, there is some dark impulse there _ the tribal preservation
instinct, or somedamnthing _ that keeps turning up.  The target keeps
changing, but the impulse remains.  So likely it'll turn toward the new
"different" people...the outsiders...aliens.  I think you'll see a lot of
people taking an "Earth First" (no relation to the current group) mentality,
hate crimes against aliens, that sort of thing.

                                                                   jms
