     I kinda agree; the "beep" stuff is a private joke, and probably shouldn't
clutter up the forum.

     As for how the picture looks on a regular TV...it looks great.  We've
looked at it on screens of all sizes, and you don't reallly lose anything.

     It's good that we worked it out so it'd look equally okay on both small
and large screens (in fact, we were less sure it would look good on a big
screen, given how great it looked on a standard monitor) since there's already
some serious inquiries about releasing it as a theatrical film overseas.

                                                                 jms
