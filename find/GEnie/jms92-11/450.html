     Yeah, the Pied Piper is a *great* analogy.  I thought that was handled
wonderfully.  (I confess I'm a comics addict; a $40 a week habit, and about
6,000+ comics.)  A good character, and I liked the way they dealt with the
lifestyle question.

     Hmm...the witchcraft thing just sent a little bell ringing...y'know, I
figured on the continuity of most major religions, and carrying on a few newer
(and maybe even eccentric) ones, but y'know, there's much to be said for some
retro...would contact with other species lead us back into our own
pasts...goddess religion revivals, druids, that sort of thing.   And, of
course, there's going to be the influence of alien religions on humans hungry
for new stuff (and vice versa, which I touch upon in one script already).
Hmm.....

     You'll excuse me, the wheels have begun to turn....
