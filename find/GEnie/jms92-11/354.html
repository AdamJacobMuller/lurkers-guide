     Just so it's clear...I've tried EVERYTHING...PC Plus, WinComm, QuickLink
II, Smartcom Exec, NOTHING I use can get me onto some local modems, especially
the WGA-BBS (for which at least some are doubtless grateful).  I'll try the
new initialization string to see if that makes a difference, but I kinda doubt
it.  It baffles me....
