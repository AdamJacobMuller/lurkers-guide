     BTW, the copy to be shown at LosCon won't be color-corrected after all;
the new transfer was going to be made on Friday, but because of the holiday,
got moved 24 hours to Saturday...which means it won't be ready in time for
LosCon.  But it's still a very good print.

     And there may be some extras, just to make up for it....

                                                                jms
