     Don't currently know if there will be any chance to show B5 at any
midwest/mideast conventions between now and airdate...after Thanksgiving,
everything of size pretty much shuts down, and there isn't much going on that
I'm aware of in January, and then boom, the show airs in February.

     I always get twitch when I hear that someone is going to fly in, or drive
2 or (in at least one case) 8 hours just to see the B5 thing.  My ever-present
nightmare is that someone will go through all this effort, see the show, and
as the lights go up, I'll hear "WHAT?  THAT'S *IT?*  I DROVE EIGHT HOURS FOR
THIS PIECE OF CRAP?!  I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!"

     This nightmare ranks right up there with dreaming I've broken a tooth or
my readyteller card won't work and I'm stranded in the worst part of the city.

     I will probably spend most of Friday night at home, throwing up.   Which
is what I did before Wishcon.

     After five years...wouldn't you?
