     No, absolutely not...the "ideas are for public consumption" has been
tried, and failed.  It opens one up to massive suits.  I know that you're
responsible, will keep your word, but the next guy to do so might change his
mind...or not get the word...it's just too much of a risk.

                                                                 jms
