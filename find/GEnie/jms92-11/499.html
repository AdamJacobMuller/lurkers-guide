     Hey, I didn't bring it up, y'know.

     Now that we're moving into a new phase on B5, there's one very important
lesson that I've been trying to drive into my skull, and it's simply this:
"Shut Up."  Yes, it's completely possible for me to spill the beans on
everything in this show...and sure, that'd satisfy your curiosity...but now
what's left for the series?  What surprises are left?

     And it little serves to put ideas out there in the public eye before
you've done them, on the off-chance they wind up elsewhere.

     I have to be circumspect about a few things.  Problem right now is, I
have to be circumspect about a *lot* of things.  We go through phases of that;
between the last day of filming, and the start of real post production, there
was a lull...then it picked up.  There was a lull just before we started
filming, lots of "Well, we had another meeting" messages.  In between was
chaos and lots of interesting info from behind the scenes (at least, that's
what I like to think).  We'll be coming into a new phase soon enough.

                                                                  jms
