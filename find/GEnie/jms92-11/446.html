     Cindy...lemme give you a little reality check.  You said you were hurt by
a cavalier message about a message that took you, oh, what?  Ten minutes to
write?

     Now you're a performer.  You've worked *years* to perfect your craft.
 You take a great deal of pride in your work.  You work long hours, long
beyond when you're being paid, and study nights to learn every single comma in
a script you're performing in.

     And someone you don't know suggests you be stuffed in a blender.

     How about some proportion and sensitivity here?

     Don't ask for others to give you what you won't give in return.

                                                                   jms
