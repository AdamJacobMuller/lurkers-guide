     Regarding the promo...the explosion stuff (not Delenn) has been seen in
lots of places via the downlink, so it's okay to discuss.  The only thing I
would ask is some degree of being circumspect about plot details until after
it airs.  But I'll try and leave it to your discretion.  One very nice thing
about the B5 crew around here is that we keep promises.

     Onward.
