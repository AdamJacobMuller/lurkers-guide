     Good comments, will pass them on to Ron.  Only points that I can respond
to: I think the blue sections are just coloration, to help tell the various
parts apart from a distance, so it isn't monochromatic and visually dull; and
the jaggies you detect in the starlog photos are from the low-res photos they
used in places.  Some shots are high-res, some are low; the jaggies are
generally in the low-res photos.

     Will convey the rest.

                                                                 jms
