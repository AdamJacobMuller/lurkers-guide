     I don't know yet what the schedule is going to be re: promo interviews, I
imagine that's something that'll get resolved in the next couple of weeks.  As
soon as I know the details, I'll pass them along here.

     Re: Tom Shales...knowing he's a fan of SF, I figured on sending him a
copy of the show on the chance he might like it.  Any advance bugs in his ear
are all to the good...basically, anybody out there who wants to write a
letter, make a call, more power to you.

     Just finished my column for the second issue of the B5 newsletter, which
I'll be modeming off to Christy later tonight or tomorrow.  The theme: "With
Great Power Comes Great Responsibility" (quoting Peter Parker).  It's about
viewers.  You'll see it in a few weeks, with any luck.
