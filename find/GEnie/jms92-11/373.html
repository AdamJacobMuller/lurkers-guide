     BTW, I'll be giving a Babylon 5 presentation at Loscon on Saturday the
28th at 2:00 p.m.  I'm going to try to get a cast member to come along, maybe
the director, depending on circumstances, but can't promise anything at this
time.  We'll see.

                                                                jms
