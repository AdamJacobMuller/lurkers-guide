     Yeah, the more I delve into Londo's character, the more I find him
intriguing.  He mourns for the loss of his beloved Empire, and this makes him
vulnerable to some dangerous temptations.  There are a number of dark corners
in his personality...but at the same time, a vulnerability, a sadness.

     In the B5 story arc, Londo goes through some *major* changes, some good,
some tragic, some frightening.  He becomes a major player, but not in the way
he would ever have anticipated.

     (Hold back, Joe, you've got a long stretch ahead of you here....)
