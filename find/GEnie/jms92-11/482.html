     Correct.  Your eyes are sharp indeed.  Yes, the bar is shaped like a
large 5, the same stylized 5 used in the title.  The title sequence, and the
ending shot that pulls back 10 kilometers from B5's observation dome window in
one take is the one that required 3 hours or so per frame for the computer to
render.
