     Re: language...English is the basic language of B5, since it's run by the
Earth Alliance.  But it's also multi-lingual; there are signs in English,
Interlac, and Centauri, and as we get into later stories, the question of
language and communication will play a larger role (and the non-language signs
are designed to be cross-species in nature).

                                                                   jms
