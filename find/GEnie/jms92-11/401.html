     Apparently there *will* be some marketing prior to the pilot airing in
February, so I wouldn't be surprised to see some patches, pins and suchlike
making its way through the stores.

      Re: the Blue-tint Delenn...that particular makeup lasted, oh, about ten
minutes until the director and I saw it.  Nothing to fault The Amazing
Criswell and his team of elves, they were pushing the envelope, which is what
we told them to do.  But on further consideration, we pulled it back to a
different tone.

     And yeah, I've lost a bit of weight over this thing...though I'm getting
a bit of it back.  I lost about 1 pound per day as we were actually shooting.

     BTW, re: Loscon...it's confirmed for 4-6 p.m. Saturday, and as well as
being there myself, also present will be Patricia Tallman, Jerry Doyle, Ron
Thornton, the alleged Mojo, and possibly one or two others.  But the first
four are confirmed.
