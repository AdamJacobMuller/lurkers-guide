     Some things one prefers to do oneself.  This one I'm looking forward to.

     (BTW, anyone know anything about the Memory Alpha BBS in Phoenix,
Arizona?  If so, please respond privately.  If not...pretend you never saw
this message.)

     Heh.

     As for the question of access, and the amount of same, by curious
coincidence I was interviewed about an hour ago by a reporter doing a short
piece for the LA Times Magazine about this little experiment, and the most
common question asked was, "WHY?"  Most other shows tend to put an
intermediary out there, at best, or just ignore the nets at worst.

     And I explaned my feelings about the situation, the desire to have an
open attitude toward SF viewers, to hear what they don't want to see anymore
on TV, and all that.  But to be honest, the single greatest reason for doing
this, to my  mind, comes from the long work I've attempted to do in
popularizing and de-mystifying the scriptwriting and production process.

     What you have, in this topic/category, from November of last year, until
today, is a day-by-day accounting of how a show goes from concept to pre
production to production to editing, every stage is discussed at some length.
And it's my hope that the archiving of this information may be of use to other
writers who are trying to understand the process involved, and thus not be
scared of it.  I hope it will be a useful document.  If so, then the
investment was worth it.

                                                                jms
