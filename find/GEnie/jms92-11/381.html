     Yeah, I understand Mojo was either going to show up, or has shown up, but
no confirmation yet.

     BTW, I've now seen the rest of the B5 article in Cinefantastique, and
it's basically okay.  Some factual errors here and there, and a few misquotes,
but nothing terminal.  (One note...the caption writer, whenever he had a shot
of someone holding something that he didn't recognize,  described it in the
caption as a 'tricorder,' when in one case it was a gun, in another case it
was a security palmtop passkey device, allowing access to certain areas; we
don't HAVE tricorders, thank you very much).

     Other than that, seems pretty good, and there's certainly a lot of stuff
from the show you haven't seen before (and a couple of things you shouldn't
have seen, but that's life), the budget information is not even close to being
correct (we had more than they indicate), and it gives you a real sense of the
people who are involved behind the scenes, the lengths they went to to make
the show work and look good, and our ideas behind the design and stuff.
Mistakes notwithstanding _ and I've never seen an article yet that got it
100% in any magazine, there's always something that's not quite right (calling
him Captain Sinclair in the article instead of Commander), it's still probably
the best article to appear yet on B5.

                                                                   jms
