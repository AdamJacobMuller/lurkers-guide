     Well, it looks like there will be some changes made in the E! piece (he
said, setting down his baseball bat, the one with the nails stuck through it).
Comprehensive changes.  Will advise when and how the new one will be shown and
made available.  (Which makes the one airing now a collector's item, I
suppose, since eventually it'll be replaced and, if I have anything to do with
it, never seen again by human eyes.)

                                                                jms
