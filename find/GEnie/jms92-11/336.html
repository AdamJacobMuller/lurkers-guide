      Thanks for the reminder.  I'll probably bring a copy of the show with
me, and may try to drag our director or a cast member to the con, to answer
questions.  This is, btw, the first time I've ever been a guest of honor at
ANY convention...and that it's in San Diego, where I got my real start as a
writer, is a special thrill.

                                                                jms
