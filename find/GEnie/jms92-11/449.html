     It was not the joke that I minded, as much as the repition of same at
some length, and the elaboration thereupon.  That said, we can move on.

     One side-light to all this, as I mentioned before (but likely it got
missed in the flood of messages) we *are* going to have a wide range of ages
on both side of the sexes.  The head of the environment for B5, a very
important post, given that a change could have disasterous effects, is a life-
sciences expert who is a female hispanic in her late 50s.

     Dr. Ben Kyle is our *chief* physician, but there are actually a number of
other doctors on board B5; you'd need that for as many people and aliens as
we've got.  And I'm playing with one story now that features a female doctor
in her late 40s early 50s.  And some older guys as well.

     You're dealing, really, in the B5 pilot, with the first act in a 110 act
play.  Trust me, there is more to come.  (And at one point, we'll introduce a
character _ assuming we haven't already _ who will be around for quite some
time, and then we'll just drop, quite casually, that the character is gay.  I
think that this is much better than doing A Gay Story.  Just drop it in and
move on.)

                                                                  jms
