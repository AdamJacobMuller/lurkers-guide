     Just a quickie note here...yes, I did attend CVHS.  It's one of four high
schools I attended: St. Benedict's, Matawan NJ; Matawan Regional High; Lennox
High, Los Angeles; and Chula Vista High School, San Diego area.  I actually
finished from CVHS in '72.

     Re: makup costs/prosthetics...we've already built 40 different species,
so we're set for quite some time....
