     Yes, we're trying to use real stars and constellations in our script
references, as well as indications of new ones that may have been discovered
in the 200 years between now and the time of B5.  (At one point, a tech-
runner's background is being discussed, and they mention that he ran forbidden
technology into the Vega and Proxima systems, for instance.)  Which star is
the one Babylon 5 orbits?  One that hasn't been discovered at this point in
time...but in about 50 years, it'll show up on the starcharts.  It's a fairly
small star, dwarfed and hidden by several nearby binaries that overwhelm the
spectrum visible from Earth.

     Yeah, that's the ticket....
