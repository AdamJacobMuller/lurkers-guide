     BTW, for those in the LA area, there will be a short piece in the Palm
Latitudes section of the LA TIMES Magazine next week or so about this little
experiment...direct contact on this scale between the makers of a show, and
potential viewers, via computer net.  Also, I don't know if it's been
mentioned, but Issue #2 of SF Age has a piece on B5, though I haven't seen it
yet.
