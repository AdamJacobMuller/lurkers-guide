     Re: Harlan's involvement with the show...it's on two levels.  First, he
is currently writing a Manifesto for the show.  If you've seen CITIZEN KANE,
you'll remember that the first thing Charles Foster Kane did on taking
possession of a newspaper was to publish a Declaration of Principles,
outlining what a good newspaper should strive for, the standards it should try
to achieve.  Harlan is doing the same thing with the Babylon 5
Manifesto...setting the standards and pointing out the things an SF tv series
should strive to accomplish, and the dumbnesses to avoid.

     Second, once the series is up and running, he will be involved as a
Creative Consultant.

                                                                 jms
