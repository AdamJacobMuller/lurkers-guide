     Young, feh...some days I feel 90.  Mainly because of the effort involved
in getting B5 to the screen.  I showed up the othe day at Harlan's for dinner,
and he looked at me, eyes wide, "My GOD you're getting grey," he said.  It's
happened a lot in a little time, kind of like the way Clinton went grey in the
one year of the campaign.  And now I've had to get multiple pairs of
glasses...regular, reading, and computer (with one pair of bifocals to go from
reading to computer)...feh, I say, feh!

     I'm 38.  Hurtling rapidly toward 40.

     "Many decades of JMS."  Hey...don't you threaten ME!

     Now, where the hell was I?  Oh, yeah....

     Basically, everything about the Earth Alliance is fractious, one side
threatening to pull the whole thing apart, and this applies not only to worlds
and colonies, but the nations that remain after the E/M War.   That's one of
the reasons I chose the term "Alliance," because it's anything BUT.  It's at
best a shaky coalition.

                                                                  jms
