     Ah, well...one can but hope.  I'd thought they would show some, and am
surprised they didn't.

     Re: the Wishcon presentation...the idiots with the flash cameras were not
so much a problem, except that they annoyed those around them, and whited out
the screen (thereby guaranteeing that the cretins who can't follow directions,
who have no qualms about being rude to others, didn't get a thing for their
efforts...I *hate* that kind of thing).  The one thing that guaranteed, in my
mind, a complete shut-down would be if I saw anyone running a video camera.
At one point, I thought I saw someone, and moved across the room...only to
discover, much to my relief, that it was someone with a red LED on her
earring.  Had it been a video camera, I would have had no choice but to stop
it, and was fully prepared to do so.

     I don't bluff.  Ever.

     Re: the comment above about no insecurities...sounds great, I just wish
it were true.  Never stopped believing in the dream, but as for my potential
to realize it...constant insecurity.  And frankly, I think that if I ever
*stop* being insecure, stop doubting, I may as well pack it in and get out of
the business.

                                                                 jms
