     Yeah, it's quite an involved article (or series of articles).  Some funny
stuff, too.

     To the question before...yes, the actors are signed (via option) to do
the series; yes, I am writing material that will be used in the series.  Re:
the series pickup...I know more than I can say, and as a rule it seems I say
more than I should.  Something official probably can be said after December
2nd.  That's all I can say.  For now.

                                                               jms
