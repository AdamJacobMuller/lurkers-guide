      Luis...jeezus, you can see how rumors take off...my 665 yell was in
response to 664, and Ron's suggestion (tongue in cheek) that we "make each
episode (of the series) two hours."  Just knowing how much angst goes into
making 22 *one* hour shows, at the idea of doing 22 *two* hour
shows...YAAAAGGGGHHHHH.

     Got it?

     Context is everything.  If there's a message you don't get, check the one
preceding.

     Amazing...the rumor mill just cranks out this stuff....
