     The recorders float on air-jets.  There are two kinds, the solid models
that sit in one place (which, if you look inside, you can see the basic
"workings" of the air-thrust system) and the CGI recorders that actually move
around in the air.

     We may play a little with the design on the observation dome (or command
center).  The rotating lights are for two purposes: to designate the center of
power and authority, and to act as sensors...you'll notice that the lights are
kept fairly dim, to better see all the instruments, and to be able to look
clearly out into space through the window without being washed out by glare.
When someone comes in, Laurel turns to address them, and a light automatically
descends upon her to illuminate her for purposes of the conversation.  When
she turns back to her command console, the light fades out.  (If you watch
closely when the pilot airs, you'll see this happening.)  This was better done
automatically than to have her do it manually every time.

     The window is made of individual sections, joined together by a very
strong metal alloy in order to better take the strain than one large plate
glass window.  Hence the different contours and sections of the window.

                                                                   jms
