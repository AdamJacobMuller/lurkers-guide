     Just to differentiate here a bit...I loved Twin Peaks dearly, but if you
missed an episode, you were utterly lost.  (And I did.)

     What maddened me about TP _ wonderful as it was _ is that it never
answered any of the questions it raised, and as stated, it was VERY easy to
get lost.  By contrast, each episode of B5 will stand alone, and every
question raised will eventually be answered.  Not immediately, in some cases,
but all will be resolved.  (Generally, questions raised prominently in an
episode will be resolved that episode; questions raised prominently in a
season will be resolved that season; and questions that develop over the 5
year arc will be resolved by the end of the arc.)

     I make that distinction because some questions won't become apparent to
some viewers until they watch a lot of episodes, and something begins to occur
to them.  And then they get the answer.  By contrast, someone who watches only
once in a great while won't think to ask the question...but will eventually
get the answer along with the rest when it comes up.

     We're talking a VERY tricky writing challenge, sort of a hat-trick, and
if we can pull it off _ and I wouldn't be doing this if I thought we couldn't
_ it'll be quite interesting.

     As to whether or not the writing style itself can begin to compare with
TP, that's for others to determine, not me.

                                                                   jms
