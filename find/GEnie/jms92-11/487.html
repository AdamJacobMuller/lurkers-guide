     There will *definitely* be specific rules and limitations for Lyta, and
there are currently planned 3 first-season episodes which deal very strongly
with her, and with the whole background of the Psi Corps, how they run, what
they do, and so on.  This is something I very much want to, and look forward
to exploring.

                                                                jms
