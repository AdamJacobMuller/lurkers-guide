     It's "Kosh" as in "gosh."  Having been on-site during some of the E!
shooting, the scenes you refer to were indeed rehearsals, though I *think*
they did some shooting during our shooting of the medlab scene.

     Re: Kosh's look...the general look of the thing is courtesy of Steve
Burg, the conceptual designer who came to us from Cameron's T2 crew.  When it
came time to make the design functional for what we needed to do with it in
the show, I and the costumers and the prosthetics guys got into it, and we got
into the stained glass idea, which I think was suggested by either me or Greg
Aronowitz, I'm not sure now which.  It's one of the designs that, like G'Kar,
reveals more the closer you get to it; usually it's the other way around, the
closer you get, the worse it looks.  (Keep a close eye on Londo's
uniform...the little scarabs and decorations that are on it all mean different
things, same with G'Kar's and Delenn's clothing.)

     When Kosh was first unveiled, the director insisted on taking a shot of
it with me.  I normally frown on this _ there are VERY few shots of me on set
doing stuff, most of the shots I supervised are of others, since it's *very*
important to me to underline that this is a team effort _ but I went ahead
and posed anyway.  The photo has now become something of an intellectual
exercise..."Which of these is the alien?"
