     Actually, it's Psi as in the Greek letter Psi, which is the root of
Psychology, which makes you *both* right.

     As it happens, initially the role of Lyta was considerably smaller.
Then one day I saw Pat Tallman in the "Night of the Living Dead" remake, and
was blown out of my chair.  I knew at that moment I had to use her in
something, and kept her in mind for this role.  When we got the go, I expanded
the role with her in mind.  Funnily enough, in the 2 years since I first saw
her in the NoTLD remake, I was at a couple of parties at which she was also
present (including the Horror Hall of Fame tapings over at Universal).  I
wanted to say, "Hello, my name is JMS, and I'm a producer, and I'd love to use
you sometime in a movie," but _ well, you can see how that sounds.  So I said
nothing, and just waited.  Talk without action is meaningless.
