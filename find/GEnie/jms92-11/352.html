     I appreciate the sentiments, but let me emphasize that this *ain't* that
big a deal.  It doesn't actually change anything.  In and of itself, it
probably wouldn't be worth mentioning except for the fact that I've promised
here that I'll try and report the news in general, good, bad or indifferent,
which should sorta help control rumors overall (and has, so far).  The other
purpose, of course, is to use the forum to show the various ins and outs, ups
and downs, and details involved in a project such as this.  Just one more of
the same.

     Bottom line...there's a lot of excitement about the project, so much so
that a lot of people tried to make things move faster than scheduled.   The
general sense is, "Let's stay with the schedule."  Not exactly the sort of
thing one can get all wound up about....

     Meanwhile, the final stages of B5 production are nearing.  We do the last
of the looping over the next 7 days, and the sound efx guys are working out
the last details in that area.  We'll deliver the finished pilot _ no more
tweaking, no backsies _ around January 1st, which will  give the stations
nearly two months to preview the show and promote it.

     At some point we'll have a screening for cast and crew, and we're giving
*some* thought to opening up whatever seats are left over to local fans.  If
we go that route, will advise.  It'd be kind of nice to see B5 in a real
theater....
