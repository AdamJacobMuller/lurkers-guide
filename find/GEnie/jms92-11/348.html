     Well, Pat had been to other cons before, so it wasn't that new an
experience for her, ditto for Mojo (Pat's connection came via her work on
Romero films).  It was Jerry's first experience, though, and he did seem quite
astonished by it all (as much as Jerry is astonished by anything, which ain't
much).  But they all seemed pleased and gratified by the reaction.
