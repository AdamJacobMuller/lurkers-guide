     It's five years our time.  How many are now working unofficially...
varies.  And it's very likely that the official word will come after the
delivery of the final mix, yes.  (Have I equivocated enough, d'you think?)

     Don't yet know the final shape that the B5 presentation will take at
Loscon.  But will advise when I do know for sure.

                                                                  jms
