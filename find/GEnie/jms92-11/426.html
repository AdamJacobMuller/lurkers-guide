     The long shot of the B5 Garden was indeed computer-generated.  We'd built
a full-size model _ about 10 feet long, in fact _ but it just didn't give us
the look we needed.  In retrospect, we're not completely satisfied either with
the look of what we got, so we're going to take some different approaches to
it in the series.

                                                                     jms
