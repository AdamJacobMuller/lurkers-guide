     Specific comments should probably go in the spoilers topic.  One request:
please try not to give away the "beep" stuff since it functions best with a
surprise element.

     Still recovering from the con...the reception was terrific.  I'll let
others comment on the specific crowd reactions, because I've tried in general
to avoid that...it's just too direct a hype, I feel.

     But it was a very gratifying weekend.  Thanks all.

                                                                jms
