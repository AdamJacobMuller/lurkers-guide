     Majel should have no reason to be frightened; as I said, it would be only
wonderful for me (and, I suspect, viewers) if both shows were around and
healthy five years from now.

     And so we move on, in a spirit of conciliation.

     BTW, I don't suppose anyone *taped* that interview on the sci-fi

                                                                     jms
