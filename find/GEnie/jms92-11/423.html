     We'll be able to use a LOT of new footage (EFX) in every episode of the
series, unlike TNG, for instance, which generally uses the same shots  with
different planetary backgrounds, and the same fly-by shot.  On average, we'll
be able to do 3-4 *new* minutes of footage for every show, and can build up
from there.  Combined with the stock that we will have and which will grow as
we go, that'll give us a heck of a look.

     Some astronomical data went into the design of the starscape and the
nebula; how much, I don't know offhand, that's Ron's area.
