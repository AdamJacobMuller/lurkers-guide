     As it happens, I was trying to get to sleep last night, and this question
was rolling around in my head.  (I spend so much time with these characters
every day that when it comes time to collapse, they're still running around
and chatting in my head, and I have to finally yell WILL YOU PLEASE SHUT THE
HELL UP SO I CAN SLEEP HERE??

     (Not that they listen, of course....)

     Anyway, I was running the question of how to introduce this aspect, and
suddenly it came through.  I think I've twigged to a means of doing it that'll
satisfy everyone.  Subtle, but unmistakeable and to the point.

     And fun.

                                                                   jms
