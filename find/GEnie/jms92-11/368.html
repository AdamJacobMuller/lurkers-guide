     Thanks, yeah, I *love* the uniforms, though we're going to do some minor
redesigns on some things here and there, just to make them a bit stronger.
The uniforms and other costumes are by Catherine Adair, most recently from
Mann and Machine, and she's *quite* good at what she does.

     And if I attempt to give her the prescribed big kiss, she'd likely deck
me, so I may pass on that part of it....
