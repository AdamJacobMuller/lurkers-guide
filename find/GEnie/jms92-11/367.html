     Whew, that's a lot of stuff to digest.  In brief, since the bulk of your
message has scrolled past my screen, a number of the points you raise are
things we've noted in-house.  The plan is to have a big post mortem meeting
some time around early December to go over every detail of the show and decide
which elements worked, and which didn't.

     Only about two points stick in my mind offhand...on costumes, one of the
problems that we ran into was jettisoning one costume designer, and then
bringing in the other with like 4 weeks to go, not *nearly* enough time to
design all the required elements.  More will be done with that in future, now
that we have enough time.  Part of the problem is that in this kind of show,
you've got HUGE amounts of people, all from different worlds, and you've got
to dress them ALL.  So it really adds up fast.

     As for the doors...oddly enough, they're very functional.  We talked to
some design guys, who indicated that in a situation where one level or another
might lose pressure, you want VERY strong doors all over the place that can
serve as pressure doors.  The jagged look comes from the fact that once a door
closes, large pins extrude into the sections that are covered, making it a
VERY solid door.  (Sound effects will further help explain that.)  That
design, we're told, is the most practical for that reason.  And yes, there is
some question about aliens as well; we have some very large, and very non-
humanoid shapes coming through, such as Kosh, or larger/stranger, and
consequently the doors should accommodate that.

                                                               jms
