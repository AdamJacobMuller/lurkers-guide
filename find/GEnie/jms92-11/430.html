     I can't elaborate, but the first script that I've turned in for an hour-
episode has an *extremely* elaborate EFX sequence (several of them, actually,
which are linked) which goes considerably beyond anything we demonstrated in
the pilot.  Ron went over the sequence, and apparently it poses no problem.
Beyond that, we have general plans to push this new technology to the absolute
edge of its capabilities.

     The pilot was a test...the GOOD stuff is still to come.

                                                                 jms
