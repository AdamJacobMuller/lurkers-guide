     The more I've had a chance to think about it, the more I've gotten
comfortable (minus my own loudmouth comments) with the Cinefantastique
article(s), and the more I've gotten annoyed with the E! piece.  It never
fails...people who don't know anything about the genre ALWAYS go for the cute
stuff...when they cover conventions for TV, they *always* find the one guy
with the spock ears, and when they cover a show with prosthetics, they
*always* go for the critters.  They turned B5 into a puppet show, and that
annoys me; used characters that have NOTHING to do with our show, who don't
appear in it, and THAT annoys me.

     It's my lot, I suppose....
