     The set where Richard and I were interviewed is the central corridor, or
at least a corner of it; it's so large that you really can't see that much of
it in any shot.

     Yes, we're adjusting Mira's voice in post to make it masculine.  I've
seen the tests, and it definitely twists your mind around.  The look is
neutral, and when the voice is female, your mind buys female; when you change
the voice, the voice is male, the look is neutral, and the *moves* are
female...and now your brain doesn't know WHAT to make of it.  It's actually a
little unsettling...which is the goal.

     RE: Lyta's eyes...yeah, that's what drew me to her for this role from the
start.  They're HUGE, which is what I always figured you'd get from a
telepath, that sense of seeing right through into your soul.  She's great.

                                                                  jms
