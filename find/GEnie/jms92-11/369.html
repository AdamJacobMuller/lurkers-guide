     That's already the plan, re: episode titles.  And groundswell or no, I've
been thinking about it, and suspect that Warners would probably nix the bumper
stickers thing.  All I can suggest is that people write to Warners and ask to
be put on mailing lists for merchandising and catalogs and suchlike when the
show gets going.

                                                                 jms
