     The guns are the one thing I'm just not very happy with, and we're going
to rethink the look, as well as the function of them.  At some point after the
final cut is...er...finalized, there will be a big production meeting of all
the various departments to do a post mortem on those things that worked, those
that didn't, and what we should/shouldn't do in future.

                                                                  jms
