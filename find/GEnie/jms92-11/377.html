     Various and sundries to report....

     Today I, other exec producer Doug Netter, and director Richard Compton
went over to Stewart Copeland's place to hear about 80% of the music for B5.
It's *really* terrific stuff that just drives the show like a sonuvagun.
Cross BLADE RUNNER with EQUALIZER in tone and you've got something *close* to
what Stewart's done for us.  Brilliant stuff.

     Apparently the B5 cover story in Cinefantastique is coming out; Ron and
his crew got a copy or two (even though I, Chief Babbler, did *not* get one),
and I haven't yet seen it, though a few pages got faxed to me from Ron's.  I
think it's okay, though again I've only seen a part of it.   I read parts of
it through my fingers...and even now, from the other room, where my spousal
overunit sits reading the article, comes this VOICE in a pitch sufficient to
shatter lead, "I can't BELIEVE you SAID that!!!"

     Sigh.  I've gotten better, really I have.  And now, when I have to give
an interview of a couple hours duration, I can be as diplomatic as anyone
could ask for.  In the case of the CFQ article, we basically gave the reporter
carte blanche...he could go anywhere, talk to anyone, hang around as long as
he wanted to...and sometimes, when things are going well, the enthusiasm hits
you, or you come up with a funny line that you say in an incautious moment.
Nothing big, just enough to remind me that there is much to be said sometimes
for Shutting One's Mouth.

     BTW, tomorrow (Tuesday) night, on the Discovery channel, they're goign to
be broadcasting a show about the video toaster, that I hear will have some B5
stuff in it.  It's their "Inventions" show, and it airs, I believe, at 9
eastern/western, 8 central.

     From the other room:  "You said WHAT?"

     I think I have to go now....
