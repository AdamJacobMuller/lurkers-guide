     Yes, nanotech is something I'd like to get more fully into.  My basic
problem is that I'm not as up on the literature as I should be (one reason why
we'll probably be taking on a scientific advisor on the show, to keep us
honest and answer these kinds of questions).  We have to find logical and
interesting ways to make{ use of that tech, but *without* getting bogged down
in explaining what the heck nanotch IS every time we use it.~r  It{{ {is,
after all, a difficult concept for a lot of folks to grasp (or seems to be,
anyway).  But in any event, to the question at hand, yes, we do plan to
incorporate it, how and where and to what extent has not yet been determined.

                                                                   jms
