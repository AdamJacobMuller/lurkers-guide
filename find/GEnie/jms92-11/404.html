     Nothing that I can say about the game for now, except that it is a very
good company.  Right now, all that is being worked out is the actual licensing
of the Babylon 5 name; nothing of the game itself has been worked out yet.
I'll be directly involved with the game design, so it'll be kept consistent
with the general B5 storyline.

     As to the Aliens comparison...no, not really, at least not from my POV.
I didn't want this to be a non-stop action show...that's more SPACE RANGERS.
My goal with this was a science fiction dramatic series, so the tack required
is different.

                                                                jms
