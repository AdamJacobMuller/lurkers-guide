     Sorry if I've been rather quiet the last few days; I'm somewhat waiting
for some news to come in, and that kind of makes me forget to post.  "Well,
I'll wait until *this* comes up, then I'll drop a note."   Like Mr. Ed, I try
to talk only when I have something to say.

     (Oh, btw...Mr. Harper has been found.  He hid behind a hyphenated name to
make it hard to find.  Didn't work.  'Nuff said.)

     Today it looks as though Warners has closed the first substantive
merchandising deal for a B5 computer game (or is about to close it).  When I
have more details, I'll pass them along.  If preliminary reports are correct,
it's a good company.  In addition, there will be some additional marketing
efforts made in the next month or two, some of which may be quite interesting.
(And I hope *finally* to be able to say something about a B5 comic.)

                                                                 jms
