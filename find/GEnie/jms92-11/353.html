     I'll put it this way...if anyone wants to write to anyone prior to the
airdate, I have no opposition to that idea.

     Re: cast and crew...this doesn't cause any complications at all, since,
again, this still conforms to the original schedule.  Insofar as I know,
everyone is contractually covered for the series through the period of time we
thought we might have to deal with, which is what we still have.  It isn't a
change of timing, it's the same timing that we've had all along.

     BTW, I just changed modems, and anyone out there who has a Practical
Peripherals 14400 FXSA v.32 bis modem, and uses Smartcom Exec, if you could
answer a question or two, I'd really appreciate it.  I can log on here using
the standard network stuff provided, but as faor (for) dialing up local BBSs,
it just won't connect.  It hears only "silence" at the other end, even though
I can clearly hear it connect via the speaker.

                                                            jms
