     Yeah, in general, I'm quite pleased by the article(s).  It/they really
give a sense of the details involved in the show.  In some cases, the details
are so small that sometimes you can only just make them out, but subliminally
they add to the sense of realism.  Any other specific comments/questions about
the CFQ piece?

                                                                jms
