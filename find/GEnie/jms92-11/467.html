     Check the announcement re: Loscon in topic 2, by the way.

     Thanks for the reference re: the writing book.  I'd very much _ VERY
much _ wanted to get the thing rewritten and updated before getting swamped
by B5 stuff, but I'm something of a perfectionist, and the process thus began
taking longer than I'd slotted in the schedule, and the next thing I knew, the
deadline passed.

     I *hate* missing deadlines, I like to be responsible.  Which is why I've
just turned in a column to Writer's Digest that, basically, invokes a leave of
absence to get B5 up and running.  (Lawrence DiTillio will be subbing until my
return.)

                                                                    jms
