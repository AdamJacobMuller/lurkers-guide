                        *** Announcement ***

      The most current edition of BABYLON 5, the full two hours, will
      be shown at LosCon on Saturday, November 28, from 4-6 p.m.  The
      cut in question has been color-corrected and includes all of the
      EFX scenes and other visuals, but still lacks the sound effects
      and Stewart Copeland's soundtrack (though I may find a way to at
      least indicate some of what it will sound like).

      Insofar as I know, this will be the ONLY preview to be shown at
      a convention on the west coast prior to broadcast.

      The room only seats about 300, so if you're in LA and plan on
      attending Loscon (at the Los Angeles Airport Marriot), you may
      want to get there early.

      Oh...and those who saw the Wishcon presentation are now free to
      discuss it at length, but please try and keep the discussion in
      the B5 spoilers topic.

                                                                jms
