     Warners *is* committed to the show, that isn't the question.  What has to
be remembered is that this (the Prime Time Network) is a new venture...people
have spent a lot of money on programming, and the stations (NOT Warners) want
to show some of it before proceeding.  The meeting was originally called BY
Warners primarily because they ARE excited about B5, and were hoping that they
could use it to open up a second night *earlier than had been planned*.  The
stations decided that they would rather keep to the original schedule.

     These things happen.  It's *not* a step back...we tried to take two steps
forward at once, and found that we have to go the old fashioned way...one step
at a time, which has been how this show has been from Day One.

     After five years of one-step-at-a-time, you learn....
