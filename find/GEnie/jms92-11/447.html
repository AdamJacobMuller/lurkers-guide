     One can argue that Cindy was confusing herself with the message she wrote
as well.

    What if I had responded with, "Cindy in a blender.  Cindy meets Freddy.
Cindy gets her eyes chewed out by ants."

    Whether it's based on a message, or based on a performance, it just seems
a little bit much to me, and cruel to the person.  Not one person faulted her
performance; even Cindy admits as much, she just isn't what Cindy's ideal
would be.  Fine, point taken.  And the "Laurel in an airlock" was funny for
about five minutes.  Now it's getting just a bit much, and I feel it's
incumbent to point that out.  Cindy felt she had been hurt by my note; how
much more would Tamlyn be hurt by her messages here?

     Just my two cents worth.

                                                                  jms
