     You bring up a good point re: Delenn's makeup.  "Those who don't remember
the past are doomed to repeat it."  In remembering the very real problems
Leonard Nimoy had post-Trek _ in which it was him in every way  except for
the ears, making him at once recognizeable but yet typecast as an alien _ I
talked to our prosthetics people early on about making very specific designs
to counter-act that.  Neither Andreas as G'Kar nor Mira as Delenn can even be
recognized outside their makeup, so that will help to avoid typecasting for
them.  Londo is very human, and that which is not "normal" is so outrageous
that when you take it off, you change the whole profile of the actor.  So
again, it shouldn't have any typecasting effects.  And certainly there's no
seeing past Kosh....
