     Just to clarify (and I swear one of these days I'm gonna put this on a
macro)...because of the need for consistency and to get ourselves established
firmly, the first season will be written by two small groups of writers: 1) a
select group I've trained over the years to my own tastes, and 2) an equally
select group of leading SF writers.  I don't want anyone spec'ing out scripts
for that first season...it makes no sense to do so until the show has run
about a season.  (We've already gotten some people sending in stories, which
get fired back with a stamped note on the outside, which I've made up, which
reads ...AND DON'T DO IT  AGAIN!  (This is the only way to deal with
*unsolicited* scripts; the process is one I've repeated before, Always Contact
the Producer FIRST.)

     Our second season, however, we will be more open to outside stuff.

     Just FYI, most shows these days are almost 100% staff written.  I have
always believed in the opposite.  Consequently, there will be only two people
on staff on the series: me, as exec producer, and Harlan Ellison, as creative
consultant.  That's it.  The rest of the show will be freelance.

     And yes, the format is the same...a dramatic script is a dramatic script,
regardless of the genre.
