     Cross-posted there...about the question of color: this is something that
Ron and I discussed earlier and at some length.  If space in time becomes as
accessible as the local freeway, people are going to start to look at their
modes of transportation as more than just plain-white people-movers.  There
will be color.  And color will vary by species, by ability to see various
hues, what's considered offensive by some will be quite proper to others.

     The only part of space that's blue-ish is the nearby nebula, which is as
close as you can get to being astronomically correct.  If you were at that
distance, that's how it would look.  Some nebulas are truly beautiful in terms
of their coloration, and they're *huge*, can fill a large part of the sky from
the right POV.  Everything else, though, is jet-black.  (The nebula is far
clearer in the color-corrected copy, and space is much blacker.)

                                                                jms
