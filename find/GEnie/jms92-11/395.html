     Meanwhile, in other news....

     Heard the last of the main soundtrack work being done by Stewart Copeland
today, and now he's cleared to finish his mix.  It's very exotic in places, a
cultural mix that goes from classical to choral to seemingly random to
incorporating Masai chants...on and on.  Which is what we very much wanted.

     Spent last night writing alien walla.  What, you ask, is alien walla?
Well, when you have a crowd scene, you should be able to hear bits and pieces
of conversations, just in background, also voices on intercoms, that sort of
thing.  And you can't just have people making the stuff up as they go, during
looping.  So somebody has to write it.   That would be me.  So there I am, a
grown man, writing lines of dialogue like "Ni tupa, dogaren?" for page after
page, and trying to be consistent and build an informal interlac dictionary.
And you start to get goofy after a while...in the customs area, I had someone
saying "Riten venyoo finewerk," which looks non-english until you say it aloud
and it comes out, "Write when you find work."

     I need a vacation.

                                                                    jms
