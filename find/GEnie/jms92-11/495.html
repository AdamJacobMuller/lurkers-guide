     To a large degree, starring/guest-starring designations are handled
during negotiations with agents, and in somc cases yes, do reflect whether or
not a character is regular (in each episode) or recurring (in one-third, half,
or two-thirds of episodes).  Here it's a little of both.

     I actually don't know much about Johnny Fleck, so unfortunately can't say
much except that he did a great job for us as a character named Del Varner.

     Was at Stewart Copeland's today, taking care of last-minute spotting to
adjust for some minor changes in the first act or two, and he played one
section of the music for me...an early version of what the music will sound
like in one sequence, the Vorlon docking.  Oh, man...it's *amazing* what a
difference music makes just in general, how it makes a scene come alive...and
all the moreso when it's as good as what I heard just a few hours ago.  It's
everything I wanted...driving, percussive, mysterious, exotic...perfect.  He's
going to do a dynamite job for us.
