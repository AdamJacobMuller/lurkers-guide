     The time for prep on year two, if we were to get picked up, would be
equal to year one, with the exception that we won't have to build all of these
sets.  We'll have more time in that sense.  Again, the stories are pretty much
mapped out for five years, so that's already done.  If we get renewed, we'll
probably get the word around March, shoot beginning in July '94, and air year
2 in January '95.  But again, this is very premature at the moment.

                                                                   jms
