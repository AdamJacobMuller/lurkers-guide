     Yes, the main titles will be in letterbox format for conventional
televisions...we're taking the footage that we've shot in 16:9 aspect ratio,
and shrinking it down just enough to fit, so there's black on top and bottom,
the same way that, for instance, TNT shows movies in their full aspect ratio.
And we've custom designed some CGI that also is in  that format.  (In the case
of series footage that we're using, there you'll be able to compare the
regular aspect ratio of the broadcast with what's in the main titles.  In
other words, there's a scene in "Parliament" of a Minbari gathering.  In
regular aspect, as part of the show, you'll see it one way.  We've clipped a
section of that for the main titles and used the full aspect ratio, and in
that you'll see the far right and left sides normally clipped for standard TV
aspect ratio.)

     Apparently this is also done on Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman, I learned the
other day, so that'll give you some sense of it.  It's very effective at
giving a real cinematic feel to your main titles.
