     There were no problems with the projector.  We started promptly, and on
time.  I'm a big punctuality nut; we showed the out-take at 11:00 sharp (as a
bonus to those who were there spot on time), and launched into the screening
itself by about 11:10-15.

     (I'm one of those terrible people who always shows up on time for a
meeting, or early...and is, despite my best efforts, always the first person
to arrive at a party.  People hate me.)
