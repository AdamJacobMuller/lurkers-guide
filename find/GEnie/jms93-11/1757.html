     In that "no one here is what they appear" scene, G'Kar is talking to
Catherine Sakai (Julia Nickson), the same one later in the restaurant scene.
It's a different look for her because that that moment she's in business mode,
and about to head out to her survey ship, the Skydancer, for which she is
captain and owner.

                                                                 jms
