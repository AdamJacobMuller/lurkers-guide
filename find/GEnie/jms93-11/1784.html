     Actually, we're not using the Harry.  First, it wasn't up to the level we
wanted to strive for, and second the best harry guy we could find had some
"theological problems" with "Soul Hunter" and we felt that we weren't getting
as good as we could.  So we've switched over to a new system.

     The rotoscope and other visual EFX are now being done on computer, as are
the cgi.  On a Mac, to be precise, by an EFX designer who's one of the best in
town, possibly the best, who's known locally as "Mr. Electricity."  He did the
same kind of work on T2, Total Recall and other features.  He's interfaced
with our other technical people, and the result is really *very*
extraordinary, considerably more extensive and better looking than what's
usually done on TV.

                                                                jms
