     Just saw the promo.  The Narn woman is Caitlin Brown (Na'Toth).  What is
in the promo is taken almost entirely from the first two episodes, with just a
smidge from #3.  Which may give you some indication of how much action is *in*
the first couple episodes (and in many epiosodes thereafter)
 -- definitely keeping the thing moving.

     I'd say that n'grath would count as a non-humanoid alien, yes?  (Just
keeping an eye on my promises here....)

                                                                 jms
