     I really don't know that much; apparently there's something in the works
about toys, but I don't have specifics.  Ditto for comics and the like.  I
tend not to get my head too far into that part of it, because I think that as
soon as you do, you can get lost in merchandising, and the next thing you know
you're doing things not necessarily because they belong in the story, but
because they make great merchandise prospects.

                                                                jms
