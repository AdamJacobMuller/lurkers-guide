     Just an update...on Monday we a) do the final mix on "Midnight on the
Firing Line," so we'll have two finished and in the can, and b) finish
shooting Christy's episode of "Grail."  (And those of you who've been asking
for nonhumanoid alien stuff...hold onto your hats for this one.)   On Tuesday
we start shooting "Mind War," with Walter Koenig, William Allan Young and
Felicity Waterman.  Both "Grail" and "Mind War" have been heavy on EFX, both
visual (on set) and CGI.

     In looking at all the episodes shot to date, from a story point of view,
I think that "Sky" is still my favorite, in how it ties into the whole 5 year
arc.  From a personal point of view, I'm very fond of "The Parliament of
Dreams," which is a very funny show, and at times a very emotional show.
"Parliament" is all over the place...it's got all of our major characters, our
ambassadors, their seconds, we see lots of group scenes, we're all over the
station, dipping in and out of three different but interconnected
stories...it's really a matter of keeping a lot of balls in the air at one
time, and I think we pulled it off nicely.

     BTW, we've finished assembling the main title sequence, and we're going
to do one extra little thing to it that's kinda neat...more on this closer to
airdate.

                                                                 jms
