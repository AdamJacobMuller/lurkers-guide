     Actually, I think it is "turn."

     Sinclair's opening narrative over the series main titles:

     "It was the Dawn of the Third Age of Mankind, ten years after the
Earth/Minbari War.  The Babylon Project was a dream given form, its goal: to
prevent another war by creating a place where humans and aliens could work out
their differences peacefully.  It's a port of call, home away from home for
diplomats, hustlers, entrepreneurs and wanderers.  Humans and aliens wrapped
in two million, five hundred thousand tons of spinning metal...all alone in
the night.

     "It can be a dangerous place, but it's our last, best hope for peace.

     "This is the story of the last of the Babylon stations.

     "The year is 2258.

     "The name of the place...is Babylon 5."
