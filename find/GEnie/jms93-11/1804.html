     Matt: okay, if you're sure...I always worry.  I've seen the damn thing so
many times, I lose perspective.  I keep thinking it's a tad on the slow side
at times.  Then I look at it again and think otherwise.

     Last year, when we showed the pilot -- its West Coast debut -- there was
a near-riot over seating.  From what I'm hearing, the Saturday screening is
likely to be *packed*.  Come early.

                                                                  jms
