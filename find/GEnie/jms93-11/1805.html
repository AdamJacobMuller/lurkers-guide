     I think I'll probably go with "Midnight" since there may well be some
cast members attending, and of our various ambassadors, only Delenn appears in
"Soul," and if we're going to have any of the others there, it would be a good
idea to have an episode in which they all appear.

     BTW, just saw the cut version of "Mind War."  It's even better than I'd
hoped.  It *moves* like an express train.  And Walter is absolutely
terrific...those of you who've only seen him as Chekhov will get a whole new
perspective on him as an actor after this one.

                                                                 jms
