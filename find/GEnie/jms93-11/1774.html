     Next up is "Survivors."

     "Born to the Purple" got mixed this past Monday.  We'll be delivering all
three episodes this Friday to PTEN; after that, it'll be once a week.   Just
like clockwork.  We're well into the groove now.

     Christopher Franke is developing themes for each of the characters, plus
themes for the station, for space in general, and for our various
aliens...something that carries a sense of the minbari, the grey council,
others.  He even wrote a wonderful little Narn libretto for G'Kar, a la
Gilbert and Sullivan.  Some elements carry across shows, but in each show
there are new and different pieces that work wonderfully.  He's nothing less
than terrific.

                                                                  jms
