     Christopher Neame was an unvarnished joy to work with, and he did a truly
spectacular job as Knight Two in "Sky."  Forceful, dynamic, and his
performance at the very end in a much quieter scene with Sinclair will make
your hair stand on end.  It's just something he says, but the implications of
what he says, and the way he says it, is just killer.  I'd love to find a way
to bring Knight Two back at some point, and the door was somewhat left open to
facilitate that possibility.

     In any event, both Christopher and Judson Scott were both terrific to
work with.
