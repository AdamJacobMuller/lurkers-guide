     Just as a reminder...I zone out when I do these things, so if I don't
immediately recognize you, or note the name, by all means say, "Hey, I'm Brett
Jaffee," or note your handle, which should be enough to jar me out of my
trance.  When I'm in performance mode, I get vague and just sorta smile and
nod a lot....
