     Darn, I hadn't noticed that.  See, starfury.gif is one of the very
earliest graphic renderings we had of the fighter, mainly for in-house.   The
logos had been put on mainly for place orientation.  It's not like that
elsewhere...I'll upload a more current version.  I simply didn't notice that.
