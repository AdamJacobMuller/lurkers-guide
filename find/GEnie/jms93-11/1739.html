     Now that we've finished mixing some shows, we've now seen how Kosh
speaks, followed through to the end.  It's a very unusual system that he's got
there, and it's *real* creepy to watch/listen to it.  The kind of thing that
makes your skin crawl after a while.

     I love it.

     Today,ter Koenig's 2nd day working in the B5 universe, as a Psi Cop in
"Mind War."  He's doing well, taking part in some very difficult scenes (fight
scenes and the ilke), and it's a very powerful performance, not at ALL what
people have seen before.  He's a terrific performer when given a role with
some meat to it.  And the dailies look great.  I think this episode will wake
up a lot of people who have never seen Walter as anything other than Chekov.

                                                                jms
