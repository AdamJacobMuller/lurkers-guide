     I get the sense that this room -- large as it is -- may end up packed.
We will be showing "Midnight."  Plus some scenes from other shows.  Plus we
may have some cast members present.  Plus the funniest out-take from the show.


     Better grab your seats early; this'll be a biggie.  And probably the only
West Coast showing of an episode prior to airing.  (Probably the only showing
anywhere, at least as of this writing.)

     (Those who've seen sections of both at cons...I assume that "Midnight" is
the better episode to show, since it's got more action, and takes the time to
reintroduce all of our characters...though I like "Soul" as a character
episode a *lot*.  Thing is, only Delenn is there of our group of ambassadors.
I'd love to show "Mind War," but it won't be ready, since we just finished it,
same with "Parliament."  What does one do when there are so many good episodes
it's hard to decide?  Anyway, "Midnight" seems the best choice to me.  Those
who've seen the two clips...thoughts?)
