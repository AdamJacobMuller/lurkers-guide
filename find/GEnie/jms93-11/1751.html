     Well, today we finished shooting on episode #11, meaning that we are now
exactly halfway through production on the Babylon 5 series.  This is the fifty
yard line, still a long way to go, but it's no further ahead of us than it is
behind us.

     After we'd finished shooting, I fired up bits of our first couple of
finished episodes for John Flinn, our DP.  He watched a bit, then went to get
some others in the crew.  And more came.  Before I knew it, the room was full
of people watching the finished show (or portions) for the very first time.
The atmosphere was electric...yells of delight and pleasure, cheers and
applause, whistles...everyone left absolutely stoked.  A real boost at the
halfway mark.

     Monday we begin shooting "Chrysalis."  Yowza!  After that follows
"Deathwalker" (with Sarah Douglas in the lead role) by Larry the D.

                                                                jms
