     So, Fenn...you liked it, eh?  I forgot to mention that I haven't yet seen
the material; it should be arriving at the office tomorrow.  I imagine they
highlighted the action, and the CGI, and the aliens (which is pretty much
stet), since it's hard to really indicate characterization in a quick promo.
Any other reactions?

                                                                 jms
