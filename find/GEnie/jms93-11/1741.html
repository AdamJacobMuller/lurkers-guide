     The B5 soundtrack for the series is built from many different kinds of
pieces, synthesized (based on one of the most extensive collection of
musical/audio samples in the world, which Christopher has been in the process
of collecting ever since he practically hand-assembled his first Moog), and
symphonic, since we're using the Berlin Symphonic Orchestra for some elements
of our score.  It changes dramatically depending on the subject.

     Re: gunfire...in a way, you'll see them...and in a way, you won't.   I
know that sounds like a Zen koan, but it'll make sense when you see how they
work.
