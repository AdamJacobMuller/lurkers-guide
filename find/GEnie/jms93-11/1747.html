     We're not shooting on videotape, so it's kind of a moot point.  We're
shooting on film, which can be converted to HDTV standards *very* easily.  The
pixel density is a function of where you go once you decide to convert the
film.  It's now being converted to video at standard resolution; when HDTV
comes into existence commercially, the film will be reprocessed out and
transferred to video at that level.

                                                                   jms
