     Our head of post production, associate producer George Johnsen, pulled a
number on me today that just struck me as hilarious, and I pass it on to you.
(We do a lot of silly stuff behind the scenes.)

     Take your hands.  Fold in the thumb until it's pointing in toward the
palm of your hand, but not entirely.  Fan out your other four fingers on each
hand as far as you can.  Now put the two hands together so that the index
fingers touch, and the pinkies are on either side of one another (i.e., you've
formed a crown or fan).  Raise your hands so that your wrists are settling on
either side of the top of your head.

     Now look at the person sitting next to you and say, "Live, Londo, and
Prosper."  This is the unofficial B5 crew greeting.  Apparently some have been
doing it when they arrive for work in the morning.

     We're a sick bunch, but we're fun.

                                                                      jms
