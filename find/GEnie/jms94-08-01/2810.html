     Many journalists are, frankly, idiots and crude; they look for ways to be
cruel.  (I'm talking mainly entertainment journalists, not the real kind.)  In
talking to some who've called for interviews, they go to "so, why'd you kick
him off?" or "when did he get shoved out?" and it's so damned
infuriating...they have to find some way to make this News With An Edge, give
it some controversy, some heat, when none exists.  I hate it a lot.
