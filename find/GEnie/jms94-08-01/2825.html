     A thought to bear in mind re: the whole Sinclair thing...I announced on
the various forums several *months* ago about the change in his role, moving
off the chessboard.  If we really were never going to see Sinclair again, one
particular shot would have been deleted from the episode; it would not have
caused us any problem since we were still messing with it anyway, and we've
certainly left things unexplained in other episodes, like "Mind War."  We
could've left the One unexplained.  We chose not to.   You can read into that
what you will.

                                                                   jms
