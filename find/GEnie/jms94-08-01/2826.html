     Cindy: on the one hand, one of the true ingredients of tragedy (or just
plain drama in some cases) is that you know something that hte (the)
characters *don't* know, and if you like the characters, and you know
something just awful may happen to them, but you don't know exactly how or
when, it adds interest, I think.

     On the other hand, 1) I've never stated that that was where Garibaldi
does (or doesn't) check out, and 2) go watch "Signs" again; there's a shuttle
seen leaving B5 instants before it explodes.  Who's on it?  We'll have to wait
and see.  Certainly, though, this would be one good prospect for a good death.
But my point is you *don't* know...so the uncertainty remains.

                                                                   jms
