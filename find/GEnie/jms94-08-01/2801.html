     Ben: thanks.  For what it's worth...I tend to write *very* tightly; I
don't like to leave things hanging, and I don't like threads that don't get
resolved.  Chekhov wrote, "If there is a gun on the wall in act one, scene
one, then you *must* use the gun by act three, scene three."  You don't put in
things you don't intend to use.  So the future stuff will all be dealt with.
When all is said and done...all will have been said and done.

                                                                   jms
