     ANYONE who says that "it is easy to write an impressive speech" has never
had to write one.  And I'm sorry, but people *do* speak in blocks from time to
time and it's PART of a dialogue.  There are no monologues of the kind you
describe, Jim, which consists of one person talking alone in a room.  They are
always part of a dialogue, they ARE dialogue, period.  You seem to think that
dialogue is one sentence from A, one sentence from B, another from A.
Sometimes it is.  Sometimes it ain't.

     Londo was not alone in the room delivering a monologue about the Narns;
he was responding to a point raised by Delenn and explaining the situation.
Sometimes that takes more than one sentence.  As far as I can remember, I
don't think I've ever had a conversation in my entire life where nobody ever
said more than three sentences at one time.  You sometimes have to break in,
"Let me get in a word in edgewise here."

     That is PART of dialogue.  You may not like it.  That's your business.
 But if you say it's not dialogue, I'm sorry, but you're simply, flatly and
irredeemably wrong.

                                                                 jms
