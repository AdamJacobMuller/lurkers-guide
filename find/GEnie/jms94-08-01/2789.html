     Well, tomorrow, at 8 a.m., filming for Season Two of BABYLON 5 begins in
earnest (minus one establisher the Monday preceding, and a shot we got a
couple months ago).  Today I saw a camera test of Bruce in his Captain's
uniform, standing in the Bazaar (a new set).  Looks great.  He has rather
reddish hair, which contrasts well with the blue (okay, teal) uniform.  The
uniform was still being sewed, and had the tailor's marks, and loose threads,
and was still being modified (we're making some small tailoring changes to
make the uniforms fit better and read better on camera, and to start
introducing some almost subliminal changes in the way you perceive the Earth
Alliance)...but it looked great, he was very much at his ease, and this was
the first frame of film shot for year two.

     The stories are shaping up to be very exciting; things are going to move
a LOT faster this season, now that we've established our universe in fair
detail.  It lets us concentrate on our characters.  Some fun titles for
you..."The Customer is Always Right," "The Very Long Night of Susan Ivanova,"
"Unnatural Selection," "A Race Through Dark Places," and others.

     It's often hard to get excited about stuff, because you're in the middle
of it all, racing from one thing to another...but I think I'm now getting a
little excited, as the reality finally sinks in.  Until the day you start
rolling film, it's all theoretical.  Now it becomes real.

     So tomorrow commences "Points of Departure."

     The ride begins again.
