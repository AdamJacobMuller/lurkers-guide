     There is a middle ground here.

     The people who like to speculate do so in print because they want to see
(and be seen) if they were right or wrong; else why write it?

     You can write to a topic without ever having read it.  So why not
speculate on voice 2 *in* voice two, then after you've seen the episode, do a
REA 23 1-whatever the last number is?  This way, you don't see any spoilers
that you don't want to see, and other folks don't have to worry about it?
This is fast becoming one of those discussions over who has what *rights* when
in fact it should be about politeness.
