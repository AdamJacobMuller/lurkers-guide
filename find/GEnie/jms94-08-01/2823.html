     Draal will not get involved in such things.  The fate of B5 must be
played out without interference.  They can ask, but he will not reply.

     Most pre-War EA warships operated sans gravity, though some of the later,
larger ones used counterweight-spinning to create a tiny bit of gravity (a la
2010), but when going into battle, that is disabled to give the ship maximum
maneuverability.

     (Can't decide if it's wonderful or sad that we've worked this stuff out
to this amount of detail....you'll probably see one or more of the latter
kinds of ships next season.)

                                                                  jms
