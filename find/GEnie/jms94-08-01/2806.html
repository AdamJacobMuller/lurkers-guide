     "Gary Cooper was a bad actor.  He WAS wooden."

     Say *what*?

     Has the taste of the american public been so diminished by over the top
hysterics and overemoting and "method" that a performer as restrained and
intelligent and *talented* as Gary Cooper is now considered BAD?

     Go out and rent HIGH NOON and *watch* it...then tell me he's anything
less than one of the finest actors this country has ever produced.

     Jesus...just because an actor isn't ripping his shirt of and yelling
"STELLLLLLLLAAAAAA" at the top of his lungs, somehow he's "bad."
