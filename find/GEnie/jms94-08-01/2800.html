     My thought was always that big ships have interceptors to take out
incoming fire, and other kinds of weaponry to deflect or knock asice (aside)
other incoming fire.  The key is to overload the defense system so that some
things get through (and the enemy ship did take some pretty heavy hits at
various points).

                                                                 jms
