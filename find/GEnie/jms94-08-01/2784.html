                         **** Announcement ****

     Since this information has now been released to the press, and will
already begin showing up on the news wires by the time I write this, I can now
make the following announcement.

     The new Commanding Officer for Babylon 5 will be Captain John Sheridan,
former commanding officer of the Agamemmnon, a deep space Earthforce military
cruiser, where he was stationed for the last two years.  During the
Earth/Minbari war, he scored arguably the only real victory in that war, the
destruction of the Minbar War Cruiser Black Star, and several accompanying
vessels, through slightly unconventional means.   He has been appointed to B5
over the strongly-voiced objections of the Minbari Government, which still
holds a considerable grudge over the Black Star incident.  But the President
feels strongly that the Minbari have had too much influence in B5, and that
this has to be reined in.

     Captain John Sheridan will be portrayed by the highly-regarded actor
Bruce Boxleitner, who starred in "Scarecrow and Mrs. King," such miniseries as
"East of Eden," "Till We Meet Again," "From the Dead of Night," "The Gambler
V," and has appeared in such feature films as "The Babe."  Bruce is also a
long-time SF fan, both in media and print.  He is excited about joining the
Babylon 5 team, and we're equally excited to have him.  Bruce begins filming
with our first episode, "Points of Departure," starting August 10th.

                                                                jms
