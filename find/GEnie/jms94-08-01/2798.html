     They haven't built 5 Babylon stations.  The first three were
sabotaged/damaged during the *very* early stages of construction; they never
got very far with them, so the cost was minimal.  Only #4 was completed, very
expensive.  When that vanished, they decided to scrimp and (with Minbari
additional funding) built a half-assed B5; there will never be a B6.
