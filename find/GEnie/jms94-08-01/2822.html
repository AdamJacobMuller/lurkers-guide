     RE: predictable...it was never meant to be much of a mystery; this
particular episode isn't a who-dunit, or who's-gonna-do-it-to-whom.  Some I
write with that in mind, some are those in which you *know* something is going
to happen to someone, and you have a fair idea what, but the "how" is
something you don't know.  It's the ride getting there.
