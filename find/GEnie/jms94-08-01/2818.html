     A second 1-gig drive was installed, but never hooked up,and I was told by
Dell it couldn't be hooked up to deliver more than 500 megs (even though I'd
paid $999 for the one gig), and wouldhave to be shipped back and exchanged,
after I'd configured the damn thing.  Well, while I've been away, I'm told
that Dell has actually fixed the thing; I'll know for sure Monday when I check
it out again.
