     (The following to be read in the voice of Humphrey Bogart)

     Now listen up, I need a name, see...I gotta lean on somebody and I gotta
lean hard.  Don't weasel out on me now when I need you, this is for all the
marbles.  A name, got it?  Somebody who works for Dell Computers, somebody I
can lean on, somebody who knows somebody who knows Somebody, maybe a
president, maybe a VP, doesn't matter....

     Oh, and if you hear some noise from the back room...don't look back.
