     The internet stuff is, btw, somewhat exaggerated; a bunch of people in
the same market (Cincinnati) noticed the change, and in some cases didn't get
the information right.  (They said it was being dropped, when in fact it was
being time-shifted to Saturday afternoons and Sunday late (very) evenings.)
This is nothing anywhere near serious enough to warrant anybody writing
anyone.
