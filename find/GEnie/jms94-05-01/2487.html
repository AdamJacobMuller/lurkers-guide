     On the topic of "constructive criticism," Jose...there is a difference
between "bad" and "I didn't like it."  A *lot* of people liked "Survivors,"
and many who've seen "By Any Means" also liked it.  Something like, say, "Plan
9" is simply bad...and those who like it admit that it's bad, and that's half
the fun.  Many people really enjoy Fred Astaire musicals; much as I like the
music from that period, I simply can't get into it.  That doesn't make it
"bad."  When you dismiss something that many people like as "bad," you are
basically calling them idiots.  Our opinions do not set us at the center of
the universe.

     Constructive criticism vs. name-calling.

     Would be curious to know, though, what you found didn't work about the
resolution to the G'Kar/Londo situation.  What I liked about it is that it's a
genuine science-oriented solution to a story problem, working out the
distance, vs. the speed of light, and finding a smart solution to the problem.
It's airtight, as near as I can see.

                                                                jms
