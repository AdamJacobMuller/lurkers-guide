     Glenn, I suspect the newspaper got it wrong, in that Kung Fu was picked
up for its third season, and they might've gotten simply confused.  We've been
picked up for year two; year three will have to wait until we're more into
year two to decide.

     The Paramount boogie-man seems to have quieted down for a while; I thing
someone told them to get stuffed.  So I think we're okay for a while.

                                                               jms
