     Earthforce One can't fit in the docking bay; never did.  The shuttle
bringing the president is shown leaving EF1, and the VO comments on the
presidential shuttle being launched at the same time.  So no, it would never
fit.

     The capital/center of the Earth Alliance is Earthdome, for anyone who's
interested.

     (Oh, nearly forgot...it's located in Geneva.)
