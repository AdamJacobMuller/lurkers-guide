     Arne's correct.  I think it's important to match artists with
writers...some looking very stylized, some realistic, some offbeat, to match
the tone of the story.  It's more of an anthology feel to it, but set in the
B5 universe.  (I believe the working title we came up with was "Tales from
Babylon.")  If you've seen any of the Grendel books, and the Grendel Tales
stuff, you'll have some sense of what we're going for (and, as Arne mentions,
the dark knight stuff).  It's also a great way to make sure you're always on
deadline; you can have several writers working at the same time, rather than
one after the other.

                                                                 jms
