     There will be reruns, in sequence, from August 31st or so through the end
of October, so there's room to catch up.  (Also reruns from June 1 through
June 29.  The June reruns include "Parliament," "War Prayer," "Mind War",
"Sky" and "Deathwalker."  The later reruns will pick up starting with
"Believers.")

     As was also announced today, Time Trax was *not* picked up, which in case
anyone was doubting the current problem should answer that question.  Re:
WWOR...apparently Paramount is all upset at the PTEN shows being renewed, and
is trying to throw its weight around to say that NONE of the stations that
have signed on to the Paramount network should carry ANY other new programs
except those produced by Paramount.  (Which is very different from, say the
Fox network and its arrangements with its affiliates.  Hell, even network
stations have the option of carrying outside shows.)  They're apparently
getting very huffy about the whole thing.
