     I think you're taking what I said to the extreme; I didn't say they were
bloodthirsty savages, only that they had a predilection toward violence, and
were generally very cranky.  And not all great thinkers have to sit around in
elizabethan garb, delicate flowers watching the skies rotate.  Aggressive
people can be good thinkers; it needn't be one or the other.
