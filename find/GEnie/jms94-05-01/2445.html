     Cutter went after Garibaldi only because that's who the dying worker
named as being responsible for the bomb.  (He didn't know he was dying, and
wanted to throw blame; and even if he did know, what better than to nail the
guy who'd hassled him before?)  Cutter only took advantage of the situation.

     Luis Santiago is playing it both ways, allowing more trade and certain
kinds of immigration, while preserving earth *culture*; this isn't the same
thing as a trade embargo.
