     There isn't much I can say at this point, except...it's truly a learning
experience.  Sometimes it ain't pleasant.  That's life.  I feel I have an
obligation, and I intend to follow it.  As for the flames...hey, I've been in
story meetings with network suits.  Go ahead, try and scare me.

     Jim...some of what you ask for you will get.  Some of what you ask for
you *won't* get.  There will be an accounting.  There will be some explanation
of the people in B5.  And so on.  Not everything you ask for will you get.
This is also life.

     No, no alternate ending was *ever* considered.  That wasn't the point.
It wasn't about solving the *problem*, it was about the people.

     And it isn't tendonitis, it's carpal tunnel syndrome.  I get by.  I can
do a little better now than earlier in the season, when it got so bad that --
even with the gloves -- I had to write 20 minutes, ice down my arms for 20
minutes, write for 20, ice for 20, and so on.  It's pretty much constant pain.
(And believe me, I've heard all the advice, all the suggestions, I use the
gloves, I do the exercises...it is what it is, and I have to live with it, or
stop writing.  If I stop writing, I'll vanish in a puff of purple smoke.)

                                                                   jms
