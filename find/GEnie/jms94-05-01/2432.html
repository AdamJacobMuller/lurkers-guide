      Ah...well, now at that the news is official (at last), I can talk
 about this.

      Yes, we have been renewed.  For 22 episodes, same as this year.  And
 we will be going on the air with our second season in November.  As a
 result, we will be showing new episodes over the summer.  The November
 debut puts on the same footing as all the other series, so it'll help get
 us into TV Guide's Fall Preview, and spread the shows over the proper
 November/May sweeps period without having to stretch with a lot of reruns.

      What follows is a *tentative* schedule only.  This has NOT been
 finalized yet, but looks like it's going to be what we run with.

      (Reruns from June 1 - June 29)
      "Grail," July 6
      "Eyes," July 13
      "Legacies," July 20
      "A Voice in the Wilderness, Part 1," July 27
      "A Voice in the Wilderness, Part 2," August 3
      "Babylon Squared," August 10
      "The Quality of Mercy," August 17
      "Chrysalis," August 24

      We begin shooting season two on July 18, the day after my 40th
 birthday.
