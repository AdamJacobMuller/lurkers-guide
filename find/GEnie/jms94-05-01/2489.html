     Before this gets too far...the Oxford American Dictionary defines pagan
as heathen...and heathen as someone not belonging to a respected, established,
or major religion, or as someone lacking in cultured moral and ethical
principles.

     (A pagan is somebody who subscribes to somebody else's religion.)
