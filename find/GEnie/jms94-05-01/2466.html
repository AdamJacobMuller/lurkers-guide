     Yeah, I hear the value of ST #16 is edging up a bit because of the B5
crossover element (and the ONLY time I will ever be involved with ST).  Don't
know about the card's value, though I have one.

     I'll have to check on the date of the Cardz B5 set; my guess would be
this fall.  Lee, let me know what you find out re: Starland stuff.

     Noticed on (I believe) another service a great exchange where someone was
explaining the difference between TNG and B5: Go ahead, imagine Sinclair,
Garibaldi and Ivanova being changed into children in this series.

     Good point.

                                                                 jms
