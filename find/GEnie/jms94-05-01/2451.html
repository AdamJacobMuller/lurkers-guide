     No, no, no, no-no-no-no-*no*.  I was neither angered nor offended; I
write what I think...and when I was trying to find words, my fingers typed out
"argh...ackk" or whatever it was.  That's just the sound my brain makes when
it tries to gear up and answer a question in a certain way.  No apologies
necessary; was *not* offended or angered or anything of the kind.  My fault; I
should've been clearer.
