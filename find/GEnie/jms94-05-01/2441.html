     Maybe we should make it Goys in the Hood....

     Re: "I just feel that good faith gets a bit strained when one of the
parties to the negotiation has power of live and death over the others."

     Except Sinclair really doesn't have that power.  Not on a wide ranging
basis (EA is still 'way behind the rest in tech), and not on a personal level.
The Advisory Council can out-vote him.  If he chooses to exceed his personal
authority and punish somebody, Earthdome can ream his butt.  (And, from time
to time, does exactly that.)  He's not a lone agent, free to do whatever he
wants.  There's a chain of command.  Without giving too much of a spoiler, in
"By Any Means Necessary," when Earthdome isn't sensing that Sinclair is
handling the labor action properly, they send in a negotiator to handle it
*for* him.  He is on a very short leash.

     Re: the screwing-up of "The Star," I don't know what happened with that,
as it didn't happen on my watch...only that nobody's real happy about it.

                                                                jms
