     Since I mentioned it over on Internet (but not where it belongs), I give
y'all a little gift...Kosh's very last line of the season, in "Chrysalis."

     "You have...forgotten something."

     It's not nearly as straightforward as it looks, and that one line will
carry with it *major* repercussions.  (And no, it doesn't refer to the 24
hours.)

                                                                jms
