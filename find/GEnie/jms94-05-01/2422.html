     So lemme get this straight, though...dos text files can be read by the
PowerMac, but Dos software *won't* work?  (That seems to be the implication.)
In other words...I can't just transfer Wordstar to the machine and get it up
and running, and my macro programs; it has to be mac-based programs, yes?

                                                                jms
