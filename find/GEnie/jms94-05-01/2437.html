     Londo and G'Kar are both married.

     Mike...calm down.  Shooting on our first season began around July 24th.
We had always planned on starting season two on July 18, even when we thought
we would still be going on in January for year two.  So nothing up-front
changes; delivery of scripts and other stuff is exactly the same as it was in
year one; if anything, we have about a week more time this round than last
season in terms of prep.  Also, bear in mind that we were finishing episodes
literally *months* before they were to air.  As I've said, I've had the final
on episode we'd originally slotted for November (prior to the schedule change)
since mid-April; in some cases, mid-March.

     The post production schedule is almost identical to season one; if
anything, because we don't have to take the time to look for a composer this
year, which kept us from scoring for a while in season one, we again have a
bit *more* time.

     Trust me, all is well.

                                                                 jms
