     No, actually, I agree..."great" and "bad" fall into the same category as
discussed above.  There are shows that I love intensely, which others can't
*abide*.

     As for happy endings...you want some variety, I think; we had a tough
ending in "Believers," a bittersweet ending in "Survivors," and here things
worked out for G'Kar and Connoly, but in a way did *not* work out for
Sinclair.  He's going to be hearing about this decision of his again, in the
not too distant future.  He's getting further and further behind the eight-
ball with some of these decisions, and he's going to get hammered about it.

     As for "Signs and Portents," I don't quite know *how* to characterize the
ending on that one.  Someone gets what they wanted, but this may or may not be
a good thing.  I'd say basically it has an ominous ending.  We do try to keep
it a mixed bag...one person may achieve a niceness, but somebody else pays the
price, or gets nailed.
