     Eerrg...arrghh...okay, look...anyone who gets to a certain position in
the industry picks up a certain element of the prima donna; that is
inevitable, and sometimes, frankly the person may *deserve* a bit of special
treatment.  Yes, there were some eccentricities...but that would describe me
just as well as it would describe her.  I've seen her be incredibly loyal,
she's *very* bright, charming, very much of the old school which says you
treat people with dignity...and when there was one occasion when something
very hard had to be done on the show, she was the one to step forward to do it
personally, rather than through intermediaries, and I learned a great deal of
respect for her through that.  Angela's okay.
