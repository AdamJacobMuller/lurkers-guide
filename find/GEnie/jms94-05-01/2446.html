     No, no rest for the wicked.  I've got 4-5 scripts to write between now
and July 18.  (We want to have 6-8 scripts on hand the day we begin shooting,
to again continue our tradition of having *lots* of lead time to work on
episodes.)

     We're talking to all of our actors, and discussing possibilities for the
season, though one or two are wondering about other opportunities and how to
balance all that out.  So we'll talk some more, see what we can work out.

     Re: the president's bill...remember, Nixon was anti-communist, but it was
eventually Nixon who opened the door to China.

     (Not that I want to give him even two cents worth of credit for doing
what was inevitable.)
