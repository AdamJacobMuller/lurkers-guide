     The Rush Act only refers to unions, for the most part; it's not a wide-
ranging law.  It was developed during the Earth/Minbari war to deal quickly
and effectively with corporations or unions which were being difficult and
otherwise holding up the war effort.  (The air traffic controllers union would
be a good example of the government doing whatever it felt necessary to
resolve the situation.)  The law grants extraordinary power to resolve any
kind of strike or union action which endangers the operation of a military
base or other military operation, as Zento states.
 It applies only to that area, and remains on the books, though (as is also
pointed out) it hasn't been used in a while.

     Sinclair's decision is legal...but not politic, and it will come back as
one of many decisions to haunt him in "Eyes."
