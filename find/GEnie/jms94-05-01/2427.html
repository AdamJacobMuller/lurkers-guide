     Could someone post for me on Internet that for some reason, the GEnie
gateway is down, and I haven't seen much of anything new since about the 3rd?
(Hence my sudden silence.)  With any luck, the gate'll open soon, and I'll
find my box stuffed with another 2,000 messages or so any day now.

     BTW, did I mention that DC is going to be doing a B5 comic?  And that one
of our own locals here on the net just may have a little something to do with
it?  And that Bill Mumy may write a bit for it, and Peter David, and me, and
some other nifty writers?
