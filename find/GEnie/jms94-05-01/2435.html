     Story-wise, I think year two will see more personal stories along with
the action stuff; I'm not sure we really had enough opportunity to get to know
our characters outside the main crisis/storyline.  Give them some breathing
space.  And we will begin the process of moving the chairs around some more,
about who's what (taking Londo one direction, and G'Kar in another, neither
being what you might expect).

                                                                  jms
