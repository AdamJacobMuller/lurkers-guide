     The Drazi are a very violent, ill-tempered species; they were the ones
who first showed up in "Deathwalker" in a Sunhawk to threaten the station;
they beat up the guy in "The War Prayer;" they show up here in "Survivors;"
there's an episode about a form of martial arts among the aliens that has a
Drazi going at it...if there's a fight around, you can often find a Drazi at
the center of it or at least nearby.
