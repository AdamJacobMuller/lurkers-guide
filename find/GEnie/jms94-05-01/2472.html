          Sigh...okay, okay, okay...it's just stupid, that's all, and it's as
     much my fault for not seeing it as it is Foundation's for making it.
It's
     one of those little glitches that -- like a typo in a manuscript -- you
     never see, even though you've looked at it a thousand times, until the
day
     you ship it off to the publisher, and BAM! there it is.

          So...the day after we deliver the episode, I'm looking at it for the
     ten zillionth time...and suddenly my head explodes and I rush into John
     Copeland's office and yell "C'MERETAKEALOOKATTHISOHCRAP."

          And I show him the shot where Jason Ironheart's ship eclipses a
star.
     "So?" says he.  "Watch the star," sez I.  And sure enough, you can
     see the star THROUGH his ship.  "Oops," sez he.  "Oops," sez I.

          So we've replaced that shot, but couldn't do so before it aired
     the first time.
