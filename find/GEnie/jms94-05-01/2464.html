     Cardz will be doing B5 trading cards.  Also, Creation Entertainment has
expanded its B5 line to include several kinds of t-shirts, a black shirt with
the B5 logo embroidered on it, and some rather nifty looking B5 mugs, black
with a blue Babylon and a metallic silver 5 behind it, very nice.

      (I'm told they want to put me on one of the trading cards...I'm not yet
entirely sure how I feel about this, though I've said okay.  I keep hearing
kids' voices in my head, "Trade you three jms cards for a Riker card.")

                                                                 jms
