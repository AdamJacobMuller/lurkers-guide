     If we get the go-ahead, there'll be a few days of frantic action, then
I'm going to want to get away for a few days or so.  It's been a LONG season,
I haven't had any kind of real break, and if I don't get some breathing space,
I'll burn out halfway through the season.

                                                                 jms
