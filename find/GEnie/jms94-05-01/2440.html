     Well, now, lemme defend the Internet for a second...what I find most
interesting about it is that most of the Internet stuff comes in via major
colleges, universities, research labs and the like.  So when you're dealing
with a lot of people of college age, you're going to encounter rough spots.
BUT...what you *also* get are people who are pretty sharp, have access to
research material, are academics and scientists and research students...and
lemme tell you, they keep you on your toes.

     It's easy to hang out in a room where people are generally nice to
you...and certainly relaxing; I tend to come here more with a sense of
relaxing with friends, where there is some measure of "put up the persona and
perform" on Internet...but one should be open to the tough stuff as well.
Granted, at times it makes me cranky, and I probably respond with more heat
than I'd like...but again, that's really more the exception than the rule.
There's a lot of nifty people there.

     Of course, there's more here, natch...he said, remembering where he
was...and this has been the oldest home of B5 Online, so it occupies a warm
place in my heart...if I had one....

                                                                    jms
