     I wrote a 4-hour miniseries script based on the true story I spent over a
year researching.  Put it out on the market.  I've had something like a half
dozen offers to produce the thing, but only if I cut it down to 2 hours.  To
do so would violate the story, because it's too involved and too astonishing. 
You'd be left with nothing.  So I'm just holding onto it until the right
person finds it, and does it.
