     Funny thing is, I've received several emails from medical professionals
who said the hesitation was exactly dead-on to when they've been in situations
of possible contamination.  Until somebody breaks the inertia and just *does*
it, as Franklin was about to.

     BTW, on the Marcabs, we've seen them frequently before, not just in
"Knives," but also in "The Long Dark" as the one who spoke about "soldiers of
darkness" to the Council, and elsewhere.

     Check out some of the isolation zone scenes, btw, and you'll see as many
as 40-50 Marcabs, in full costume and full prosthetic, the biggest of any
single race we've ever done.

                                                                   jms
