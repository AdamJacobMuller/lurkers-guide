     Nobody said it was marital fruit.  The line is, "It's a rebirth ceremony
that sometimes doubles for a marriage ceremony."  Naturally, everybody glommed
onto the second interpretation, the lesser one, while ignoring the primary
interpretation, rebirth (as in what Delenn was planning to do with the
chrysalis).  (Well, correction, not everybody went for the misdirection, but
most did.)
