      Been busy with post-production on B5, and without much traffic in here
before, hadn't checked in for a while.

      The revisions on the writing book are virtually done; there's just a bit
more tinkering to do with the stage/playwriting chapter, and it'll be done. 
Four years in the works....

      For those who've inquired about other works...you can find some of my
short stories in the SHADOWS 6 anthology, the MIDNIGHT GRAFITTI anthology
(with the same story appearing in an issue of PULPHOUSE), and AMAZING STORIES.
Some digging may be required.

      One of the main difficulties with exec producing a series is that it
leaves time for *nothing* else.  Haven't done any fiction or prose work in a
couple of years, not counting the issues of the B5 comic that I've written/am
writing.  The only time I even get to see a movie is if I'm on a plane
(assuming I'm not writing on the plane).  (On the trip to and from the UK I
saw FORREST GUMP, TRUE LIES, ED WOOD, MARY SHELLEY'S FRANKENSTEIN and
INTERVIEW WITH A VAMPIRE, just kept grabbing tapes from the flight attendents,
who kept asking, "Don't you EVER get out?")

      Strongly considering publishing either a B5 script or a Murder, She
Wrote script in the scriptwriting book, in its totality.  Haven't yet decided
which.

                                                                  jms
