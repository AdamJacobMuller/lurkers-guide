       The odds of B5 ending up on the WB network are slim and none.  You have
to step back a second and realize the corporate structure of Warner Bros. 
Rather than one monolithic structure (a la Paramount), Warner Bros. is
actually kind of a hive mind, with something like 40 or 50 different
departments, arms, jurisdictions, companies and approaches, all of them
mutually competitive.  PTEN and WB, for instance, are two totally different
arms, and *very* competitive with one another.  I suspect either side would
slit their respective wrists before letting a show go from one to the other.

                                                                   jms
