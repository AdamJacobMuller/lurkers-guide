     There was no change in Delenn's attitudes.  They're two different
circumstances.  In "Believers" Delenn was being asked to mediate in a dispute
between Franklin and the family, over essentially matters of the soul (as she
put it).  They do not interfere in matters of the soul, she explains.  This
wasn't such a situation.
