     I'm going to put this up now, while I'm thinking about it.

     Next week, "Confessions and Lamentations" airs.  It is a very strong,
uncompromising episode.  It occured to me that parents of young kids (and
there are surprisingly a lot that watch) should *maybe* consider watching this
one on their own first, to make sure it's okay for their kids, and to maybe be
ready to discuss it afterward.  Just a thought....

                                                                     jms
