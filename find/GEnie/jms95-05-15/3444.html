     It's *possible* you have the Marcabs confused with the Brikiri, who are
somewhat similar in look, until you get close; it was a Marcab, again, who in
very good english explained the soldiers of darkness in "The Long Dark."  On
the other hand, we might've shown somebody grunting, I could be wrong.  Not
all Marcabs are fluent in English, certainly.
