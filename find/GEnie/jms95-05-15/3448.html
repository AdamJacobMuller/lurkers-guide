     No, I've never made any bones about the fact that, should B5 run its full
5-year course, barring any side-stories that might spin off, my intent is to
probably get out of TV and go back to novels and plays.  I have the next novel
outlined already -- it'll be a 1,000+ page whopper -- but haven't had time to
write any of it.  It'd take probably a year full tilt to write it.  After
that, probably back to plays.

                                                                   jms
