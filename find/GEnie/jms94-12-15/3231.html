     Perhaps the whole gay issue might be better moved elsewhere; it's lately
caused quite a conflagration over on Internet, and it'd be unfortunate if the
same began to happen here.

     Re: 'zines...basically, I'm dealing with it the only way I can, which is
to ask if such 'zines could be confined to nonfiction stuff during the first-
