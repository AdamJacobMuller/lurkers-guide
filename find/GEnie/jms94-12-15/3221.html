     Cross-posted with Hutts...yes, it's generally much looser in syndication.
I don't think we've gotten a note yet saying "You can't do X because we think
it would offend someone."

     And one does not have to see "sexual diversity," one can prefer not to.
Yes, it's everywhere, and yes, it may even be somewhere in this show, but one
can certainly put one's fingers in one's ears and hum loud until the scene is
over....

     I think it depends on how it's done; if it's just *there* as part of the
background, not given any special treatment, not hammered home, not made into
a Major Storyline...I don't see a problem.

                                                                  jms
