     ...ah hates santa claus....

     Re: have I rejected any of my own scripts...as a matter of fact, yes, I
have.  There was a version of SOUL HUNTER which went out as a first draft,
which when I read it again, I realized was just *wrong*.  So I had all copies
of the script recalled, sending a memo explaining that "I had been momentarily
possessed by an idiot."

     In addition, last season I started writing a very different two parter
than "Voice."  I turned in the first part, and while a number of folks liked
it, it *really* wasn't up to par.  (This was the first part of the flu I'd
gotten.)  So I chucked it completely, and wrote what ended up as "Voice."

                                                                jms
