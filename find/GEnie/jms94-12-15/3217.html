     Generally, nobody goes over our scripts with a fine toothed comb looking
for things to object to (a la network censors).  In the case of this new
script, the situation was so large that it could not be missed, or not
referenced.  It had to be raised with PTEN before doing it.   You'll
understand when you see it.

     I should mention again that our contacts at PTEN have been nothing less
than terrific in that they leave us to our own devices and allow us to tell
our stories with virtually no interference.  They've been great.

                                                                jms
