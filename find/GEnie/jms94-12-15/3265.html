     BTW, and not to get off on a whole SeaQuest tangent, but...today I saw
something even rarer than a unicorn: a good SQ episode.  It hasn't aired yet,
probably won't for a few weeks yet, but as you check your TV Guide, look for
the one where a new experimental sub sporting artificial intelligence tied to
Bridger gets loose.  It's actually quite nice.

     Of the "SeaQuest Meets the Triffids" episode yet to come...the less said,
the better.

                                                                  jms
