     Peter: yes, I constantly get those as well for scripts.  I think every
writer does.

     If an actor isn't sure about a scene, for whatever reason, they are
encouraged to come to me and discuss it.  (And it doesn't matter WHERE I am,
if I'm reachable by phone, I'm there.)  That's happened a few times this
season, most of which were handled by explaining how the scene relates to
things that're going to happen in the future.  Sometimes the intent isn't
necessarily as clear as had been thought, or even the emphasis on one word
rather than another can change the meaning.  There's only been one case in all
two seasons and pilot to date where an actor felt uncomfortable doing
something, and in that case I think it was correct to adjust the scene
slightly.  Didn't affect the story as much as just one scene within the story.
You have to give them a fair hearing.
