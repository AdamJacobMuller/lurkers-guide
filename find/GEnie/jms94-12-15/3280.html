     Okay, here's the deal...my Spousal Overunit some time ago installed a
sound card into her computer.  From that point on (at least we're fairly sure
that was the deciding point), she could no longer access both her serial
of to try and make the darned thing work; so now she has to keep switching
between modem and mouse.  If there's ANYone out there with some suggestions on
how to fix this, that'd be great (given in very plain layperson's terms,
because neither of us is a rocket scientist at this stuff, real step-by-step
stuff).

                                                                   jms
