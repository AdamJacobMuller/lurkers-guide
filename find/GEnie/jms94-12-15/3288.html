     Re: pacing...quite correct.   I think the pacing should vary
according to the story we're telling; some are slower, some fairly average,
and some are written, acted and directed at a dead run.  I like tuning into a
series and never quite knowing what the hell to expect each time.

     All things considered, the episode went through fairly cleanly, script-
wise, not much in the way of revision.  Peter has a good ear for dialog (not
surprising).  So for the most part it was little stuff; for example...Peter
came up with, "Either I'm in hell or in medlab," to which I appended,
"...either way, the decor needs work."  Which is kind of the fun in getting an
outside script; you can hear the first part of a line you'd never considered,
and knowing the character, you can take it just a little further.

                                                                   jms
