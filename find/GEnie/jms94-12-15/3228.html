     Never said that "nobody's making any money," just that the majority of
writers aren't (but that applies to both print and media).  If someone is
coming here with dreams of megadollar success dancing before their eyes,
they're in trouble.

     Which answers your other question.  Why are they sending in endless
numbers of scripts?  Because they've bought the okeydoke that there's money
just hanging on trees here, and lots of it; that while most of them would
never consider writing a novel, it's just TeeVee, they can do as good a job as
anyone else (I've gotten letters from people who say that most of the writing
on TV sucks, that I'm not doing a good job on my own show, but THEY can save
it for me with their stories if I'll just buy them en masse)...the majority of
them really don't want any kind of CAREER in TV writing, they're not willing
to come out here and hustle; they just want either a) the money, or b) the
Pointy Hat that says they did it.

     Which is exactly why it's so hard to sell for a newbie; you're competing
with all these other folks who think they can write for TV, and you're lost in
all the background noise.
