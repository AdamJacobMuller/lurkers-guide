     It wasn't a producer, it was a civilian, one of a focus group asked about
B5 and SF.

     Jose: you're quite correct; I know that many of the writers over at ST
have been chafing for a *very* long time to do more challenging stories.  It's
just that overall, the Big Two there have been sitting on them, keeping the
stories as tame as possible.  With any luck, our continuing presence will be
enough to provoke them into allowing more challenging or controversial or just
*different* kinds of shows to be written.

     Speaking of which...on Monday I turned in a script called "And Now For a
Word."  It's probably the most unusual episode to date...so much so that I was
very concerned about Warners approving it, and indicated in my letter (which
explained why it was done, and why it should be produced) that I wouldn't be
putting in for a script payment until I knew they would accept it and let us
make it.  Finally heard back today that they've approved it.  This will be
shot as episode 214, and what you've just read is ALL I intend to say about
this script between now and shortly before it airs in May.  (Though when we
cast the guest star, which we're in the process of selecting now, that I'll be
able to announce.)  It's not controversial per se, but does take our entire
show and put it on its head for the entire hour.  (I also had to make sure we
*could* physically produce the darned thing prior to turning in the script.)
No speculation, please; just let it be what it is, and see it cold.

      Suffice to say, though, that I'm VERY pleased and relieved right now.

                                                                 jms
