     We'll probably know come April about a third season, in any definitive
sense, though we may have hunches before then.

     Actually, "The exception proves the rule" is a corruption of the original
Latin, which I believe is something along the lines of, "Exceptio probat
regulum," which as a phrase translates out to, "The exception puts the rule to
the test of proof."

     I have no real desire to direct; I could if I so desired (and sometimes
I'll make murmurings about setting aside an episode to direct myself, which is
a perk I have if desired, just to watch producer John Copeland turn a whiter
shade of pale), but I just don't think it's something I want to do.  My other
writer-friends think I'm crazy to pass this up, since Writer/Director
hyphenates are kind of the In thing, and command major bucks and deals...but
ehh...I'm a writer.

     One's relations with a given studio are in large measure affected by the
person you're working with.  There are good folk and bad folk.  We have been
very, very fortunate in that our PTEN liaison is a very smart fellow, very
thoughtful, reasonable, who kinda understands where we're going with this
story, and allows us to go where we wish.  I've been on other shows where the
network or studio liaison can destroy a series and make your life a living
hell.  It's really the luck of the draw.

                                                                  jms
