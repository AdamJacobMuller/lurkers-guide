     There is no reference in the liner notes to ANY of the characters, and
there is NO "outlining of the story of B5."  The report you've heard has been
mischaracterized.  There *is* a photo of Sinclair there.  And from what I
understand, the license/promotional deal emphasized that the current cast
should be specified in the thing, since it's being released in the current
year, to make clearer it's a 1995 release.  A cast list put out right now
would not have Sinclair on it; that's the same situation as this.

                                                                jms
