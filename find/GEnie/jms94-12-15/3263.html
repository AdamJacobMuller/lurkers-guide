     Ah has only one other thing to say on this whole left wing/right wing
CONtroversy (and why ah'm talkin' like ah jus' escaped from a play by that
Tennessee Williams fella is anybody's guess)...stone cold fact is, unless that
eagles got a left AND a right wing, in perfect balance and given equal
respect, it ain't NEVER gonna fly.
