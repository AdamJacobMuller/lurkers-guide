     The assumption above is correct; one shouldn't consider B5 to be
exclusive in this approach.  Folks like David Moessinger, my Executive
Producer on MURDER, JAKE and (albeit briefly, before I ran screaming out into
the night) WALKER...Mark Shelmerdine, my Executive Producer on the new
Twilight Zone...and others I could name, all people of conscience and
integrity and loyalty, who create a healthy and positive place to work.

                                                                  jms
