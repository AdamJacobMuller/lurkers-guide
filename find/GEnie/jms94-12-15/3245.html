     Re: moving airdates...this is stuff I mentioned some time ago, so no one
should be startled now.  As stated before, Paramount is taking Monday and
Tuesday nights; Warner Network is getting Wednesdays; so you HAVE to move B5
somewhere.  There's only Thursday-Sunday left, so it has to go somewhere in
there.

     The cheat code for Babylon 5?  PERCIVAL.
