     Oh, yeah, and these next six are gonna be major head-thumps too, that
much I can promise right now.  (It occured to me, I think that we go on the
air with new eps about the same time Voyager hits the air; this should be an
interesting contrast, 'cause there's some stuff in this next batch that just
goes balls to the walls.)

     And yes, THAT "Walker."  When the show was still with Cannon TV,  David
got jammed up and asked me to come in for a while, in between leaving "Murder,
She Wrote" and starting B5.  I came on as Supervising Producer...and the
second I walked into the Cannon building, I knew this was gonna be trouble.
I've got a good snake detector, and it was going off like crazy.  I tried to
warn David, but David is a good soul, and he trusts people, and figured he
could make it work.  But I knew we were standing on the deck of the Titanic
and somebody'd just ordered ice....

     I rewrote several scripts (no credit taken), and wrote one of my own,
which got produced and aired.  Nobody was being paid, there was mass chaos at
the top, and finally I just bolted over the barbed wire and escaped.  David
understood, tried to find some way to stop the hassles, but in time the whole
damned thing exploded, and CBS took the show away from Cannon after David
finally bailed.  It's a nightmare organization.

                                                               jms
