     Not all jumpgates are hooked/linked with one another.  Very ofteen you
DON'T have to leave hyperspace, just jump from A to C, and from C to Z, riding
the lock-on to each one (Catherine Sakai programmed in just such a sequence in
MIND WAR, in fact).  You don't usually have to leave hyperspace to go from one
gate to another; usually, in the case of the freighter being discussed, it
left hyperspace at the last jumpgate stop to pick up supplies, people, cargo,
other stuff, and was heading back to the gate again.

                                                                  jms
