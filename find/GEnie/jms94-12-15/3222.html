     PTEN is a completely separate entity from the Warners network, and there
is a strong competition between the two.

     Kia: yeah, there's religion all over the darned place.

     (In the voice of Chico Marx:)  I don' know, Boss.  I don' like-a the
religion, but everywhere I go, boom, there it is.  I open up a can of
sardines, ey, there's a religion, no kiddin', you gotta believe in somethin'
afterward to eat those things-a, you know?  I go for a walk, I get cold, I
sneeze, and som'body says-a to me, "God bless."  Again with the religion.  So
I give-a up.  I go inna church.  You know what they got goin'?  Bingo.  So I
stayed.  Made fifteen dollars.  Hey, you and me, we go get-a some tootsie-
fruitsie ice-a cream, eh?
