      As long as we're talking about other stuff...this Friday one of my
episodes of "Murder, She Wrote" that got a lot of press will be run on USA,
"Incident in Lot 7," set on the Universal Studios lot, in the old Psycho
house.  It's kinda fun, got some good lines here and there.

      I was talking to somebody who worked it out the other day, and having
written over 120 *produced* episodes of TV, the fact is that one day out of
every three, you're going to find something of mine somewhere on the schedule,
which is probably why I don't mention it much.

                                                               jms
