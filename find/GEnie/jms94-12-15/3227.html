     Pat: and I still say that if you don't have anything to say in your
story, then sure, let the audience reaction tell you what to write.  That just
doesn't do it for me.

     PTEN = Prime Time Entertainment Network.

     I really don't have a problem with fixed writer fees in TV (and bear in
mind that directors also have fixed fees in TV).  Would I like those fees in
general to be a bit more?  I could be greedy and say yes; actors' fees aren't
really set, they're very much open to negotation, and can range from scale of
maybe $9,000 an episode to $30,000 or $60,000 per episode.  And I would
certainly like it if syndication fees were made to equal network fees (right
now it's about $17,000 for an hour syndicated script, and about $22,000 for a
network script).  If both those figures were bumped, say, five grand, I
wouldn't object.

     But I just can't seem to get too exercised about the whole thing, mainly
because I know what writers get in other fields, like novels and short
stories.  Also, the residuals schedule for writers and directors is a bit
better than for actors.  (BTW, residuals aren't a gift; they're deferred
payment.  The writer gambles with the producer; if the show's a flop, there
ARE no residuals, and the producer gets off cheap.  If the show's a hit, then
the writer gets additional fees in the form of deferred payments on the
script...residuals.)  So in the long run, they probably break even all around
between actors, writers and directors.

     In feature films, you've got a definite ranking system, and you can get
anywhere from scale ($60,000 or so) for a feature film up to the $1-2 million
range for a select few.  The budgets of feature films are MUCH higher per hour
than a TV show, so a sliding scale seems to me quite appropriate.  TV budgets
are limited, and much, MUCH smaller.

     Producing fees are also a separate category in TV, ranging from $6,500 an
episode to $25,000 or so per episode, depending on title and responsibilities
and how good your agent is.

     What isn't generally understood is that most TV/film writers earn less
than the average elementary school teacher on an annual basis; that roughly
50% or more of the Writers Guild of America are *unemployed* at any given
moment; that the percentage of WGA members who earn in the six figure category
comprise maybe 3-4% of the total WGA membership.   There's this illusion that
being in this business means major bucks.  It doesn't.

                                                                     jms
