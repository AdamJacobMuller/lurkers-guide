     Tell you what...I could either struggle through Wc3 without the cheat
codes, or make Babylon 5.  Understand that I am obsessive/compulsive in
nature....

     Will try the alt-o.  It's some solace....

     Only four people have seen the five-year arc (and not all of it at that,
only about a 10 page summary of the thing), which is about three too many for
my tastes.  None of them are execs with PTEN.

     Maybe the symbol for B5 fandom might be &gt;@&lt;, which is a starfury.

                                                                   jms
