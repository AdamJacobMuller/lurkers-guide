     Small corrections...the Hugo space ship is silver; 7 Hugos have
been given previously to SF shows, 3 to the original TZ, 4 to ST (old and
new). And yes, apparently the "Is There A God?" debate has become the 
con's #1 seller on tape, with Buzz Aldrin's speech second (I don't know 
whether to be pleased or chagrined), but we definitely didn't go to 
dinner afterward...we ended up at the same restaurant, but different 
tables on opposite sides of the restaurant.

     (Aside: I had to wolf down my food to get ready for the Hugo
ceremony, and just as I was finishing, a fan had the waiter bring over a 
tray of food, christened spoo.  I couldn't eat it, had to run, so I gave 
it to the fellow I'd been debating, explaining that it was "an act of 
atheist charity.")

     Aside to Mike Cooney...was there a message uptopic where you went
over ways to more economically/reasonably portray, like, thousands of
ships on-screen?  Not that I have any reason for asking this question....

                                                                   jms
