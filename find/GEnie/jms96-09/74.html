     There's a term, for let's say England, when you're between rulers, 
one has passed along and the other is perhaps too young to rule, or they
haven't yet decided on someone...a term for the person who's in charge in 
the interim, and I can't for the life of me think of that term.  Anybody 
know what it is?

                                                                  jms
