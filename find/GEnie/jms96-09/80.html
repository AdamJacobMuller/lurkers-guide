     Today John Copeland and I did our producer's cut on the first
episode of year 4, "The Hour of the Wolf."  Granted my opinion is 
subjective and biased...but of all the first-episodes we've had each 
season, this one is the best.  I was searching for the right word after 
looking at the director's cut, and finally came to it...maturity.  It has 
a depth we've only skated through before, all meat, no filler.  This one 
and the next batch are also all over the map, literally...B5, Narn, 
Centauri Prime, elsewhere...so it's a real challenge.  But it looks great.  

                                                                  jms
