     And just so you understand...it's not just a question of building
sets.  Yes, you start with that expense.  Now add extras to populate the
scenes.  If you're going to have people being killed or even bumped 
around, you need stunt people, and that's very expensive if you start 
having more than 2-3 of them in a scene.  Now there's the CGI.  Now 
there's the cost of the pyrotechnics.  And the staging.  Crashes or big 
action (live, not CGI) scenes can take an entire day to set up.  Yeah, 
you can get a 15 second BIG SCENE, but it'll cost you hideously, and 
it'll add an extra day to production, and you'll have to throw out other 
stuff.

     We save our big hits for where they will make the most impact,
but again, this is TV, not a major feature film.  The ST shows get about 
$1.2-1.4 million or more per episode, depending on circumstances.  S:A&amp;B 
cost $2 million an episode on average.  Our budget is limited to under 
$900,000.  We do the best we can with what we've got.

                                                                  jms
