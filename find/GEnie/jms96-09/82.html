     Also, what tends to happen is that a message of mine gets 
paraphrased or misremembered, and someone says, "Well, back in 1993, jms 
said..." and if they get it wrong, and I don't catch it, it becomes part 
of what's assumed is actually happening.  It's like playing telegraph 
with 25,000 of your best friends....

     Small correction: my first on-line service was actually Compuserve, 
back around 1984-1985.  I was one of the first to hit that service, I 
think, and certainly the first TV writer I knew over there.

     Re: the crew...nothing else has changed.  We've still got John 
Flinn  III as our DP, Ann Bruice-Aling as costumer, John Iacovelli as 
Great Maker of All Things Art, Chris Franke on music, optic 
nerve...they're all still here, all still doing great stuff.  Directors 
for the fourth season include Mike Vejar, Jesus Trevino, David Eagle, and 
some new folks we're trying out, Kevin Dobson (not the actor), John 
Macpherson, and we may even let Stephen Furst do an episode, since he has 
a long background as a director for smaller films and theater.
