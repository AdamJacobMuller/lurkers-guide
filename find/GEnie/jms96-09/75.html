     Stims take a while to work out of your system, to get totally 
flushed out (as will be noted shortly), but when they're gone, it's 
unpleasant.  

     My own take on "And The Rock Cried Out, No Hiding Place," which
airs tomorrow in the UK...I like it.  The Brother Theo stuff is a tad
stilted in a couple of places, but it's only a couple of minutes, and the 
rest works real well.  It's a very subversive episode in its way, and a 
part of it still creeps me out.

                                                                   jms
