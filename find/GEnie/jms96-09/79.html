     Foundation also did the majority or all of the battle stuff in
last week's Voyager.

     Re: NDE...Doug was very happy with that name, which they arrived
at after long, long discussions...and just after they locked it down, I 
pointed out that NDE is also a term for Near Death Experience, which has 
since become how some of us refer to  it.  (Or a Near Doug Experience,  
which is kinda the same thing, only without the light show.)
