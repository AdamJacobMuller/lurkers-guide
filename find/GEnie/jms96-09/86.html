     You ever get one of those pieces of news that leaves you at once
vaguely amused and horribly chagrined?  Turns out in the October issue of 
BUZZ Magazine -- the high-style, fancy, New Yorker-in-aspiration LA
magazine for rich folk -- they have the 100 Coolest People in LA.  How do 
I know this, even though I don't subscribe?  I got called by a friend.

     Yep...for the first time I am now officially cool.  

     Still processing this one.

                                                                 jms
