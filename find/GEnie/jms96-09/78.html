     There's always a danger in making the show about the New Alien of
the Week, which we tend to try to avoid.  As for Hypernauts, yes, they
showed a lot more virtual environments...but the resolution of those 
shots were nowhere near the level of resolution needed for a show like 
B5.  They  looked more plastic-y, more obviously CGI.  The only way they 
could render that much material was to go for low-res stuff, and do other 
tricks.  It also helped that they shot that show on *videotape*, which is 
far cheaper than film.  If you did the Hypernauts EFX tricks on B5, 
they'd look very chintzy, for the most part.  

     That said, we *are* going outside the station more and more in
the last batch of year 3 episodes, and even moreso in the initial 
episodes of year 4.  We go to Narn, more time is spent on Centauri Prime, 
Minbar, Mars, Earth, and elsewhere.

                                                                 jms
