     Mike...on the one hand you keep asking for big battle set pieces, 
then you say you don't want a war story...you'll forgive me if I note that
you're sending out mixed signals.

     You may also want to wait to see what we *do* rather than
worrying now about what we *might* do.

                                                                 jms
