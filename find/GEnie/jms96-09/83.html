     Actually, "Alas, Babylon" is a terrific book by Pat Frank, which
came out in the late 60s, which I recommend to anyone.  Great reading.  
Since first reading it as a kid, I must've reread it a dozen or more 
times over the years until the darned thing fell apart.  (Paperback.)  
While at  Worldcon, I picked up a first-edition hardcover of the book, 
and started reading it again while I was there...and fell right back into 
it again.

                                                                   jms
