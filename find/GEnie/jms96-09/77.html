     Well, sometimes you go along making an episode, and when it's all
assembled -- which is really the only time you ever know if it's turned 
out the way you want -- it's kinda late to change much.  You're filming 
the next episode, you can't go back and refilm it or rewrite it.  So 
there's really very little you can do at that point.
