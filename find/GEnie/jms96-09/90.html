     Mike: okay, I've been quiet, even though others have noted it,
but you're straying again and again into story suggestions, how the next 
season should be done, what the environment should be like, even titles; 
stop it.  I can't be blunter than that.

     Well, actually, I *can*...but the situation is born out of
enthusiasm, and more or less forgiveable.

     As for GROPOS, that one episode was so far over budget that I had
to write 2 smaller ones to make up for it, and the many people you saw
were really just one small group that took forever to digitally composite
into looking like a much bigger group.

     Mike, your suggestions on production are all well and good for a
big budget movie.  That's where your mindset is at.  But this is a TV
show.  We have TV limitations.  We have a budget below any other SF show 
around. We do the best we can.  Please stop gigging us for things that we 
can't do, and no other TV show can do.  

                                                                   jms
