     We hope to have a web site set up for the fan club soon, so that will be
a point of registration.

     Re: widescreen...I've noted this before...we would have to go back and re-
telecine the film stock back to its original format for every frame of film,
which would cost upwards of $250,000 up-front, and we don't have that
capacity.  That could only be done when a major player comes in to distribute
disks.

                                                                    jms
