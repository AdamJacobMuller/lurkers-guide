     I know Mark Halperin's work, though I haven't read that much of it.   I
enjoy reading fiction, but due to the nature of the job, I don't have much
time for it just now.  (Simply producing the show would be an 18 hour a day
job; just writing all the eps so far would be a 16 hour a day job...somewhere
in here I have a serious math problem.)  These days, I find myself more
reading nonfiction...biographices, collections of essays, historical works,
(that should read biographies above), that sort of thing, when I have time,
which is rarely.  Tried, with minor success, to plow through Hunter Thompson's
latest...I've got Vach's Batman novel on my pile to read, some other
stuff...but there just isn't time for most of it.
