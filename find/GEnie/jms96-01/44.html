     No, that's not the intent; but this is the time when stations make their
decisions about what shows they're going to pick up, and each year you get a
LOT of new shows out with a lot of hype and heat, and it's possible for a show
that's been around for a bit, middle of the road, to just sorta get forgotten
about in the crush.  So it never hurts for fans to remind the station owners
what they want.
