      BTW, two quickies...I haven't had a chance to read it or buy it yet --
or ANY book lately, or see a movie since May -- but Harlan noted to me lately
that our own Adam Troy-Castro's latest novel is especially spiffy, so folks
here may want to check it out.  Also...if you count yourself as *any* kind of
fan of quality SF, then you may want to check out a movie that's SF if you
kinda squint at it a little, and is very likely one of the best movies of its
genre (whatever it is) ever made.   I'm referring to SECONDS, starring
(believe it or not) Rock Hudson, a B&amp;W film directed by Frankenheimer when he
was still terrific.  I mention it because AMC and Bravo are both showing it on
cable this month, in LETTERBOXED form (which I've never seen before), and it's
just an amazing and disturbing and brilliant and absolutely frightening bit of
film making.  If the last two minutes don't give you a case of the screaming
willies for *days* then your cerebral cortex isn't properly installed.

     I don't often recommend things, but if you want to see a film that is
just breathtakingly well done and surreal and guaranteed to make the hair on
your arms stand straight up...grab SECONDS this month.  It's *NOT* available
on disk or tape insofar as I know, and uncut, in this form, is very rare. 
Trust me on this one.

                                                                       jms
