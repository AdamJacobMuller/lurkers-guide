     Broadcast networks are still adamently opposed to LBX broadcasts 'cause
most folks have small TVs and would tune out.  (A lot of folks who spring for
cable tend to have larger TVs, so it works a bit better there.)  A network
suit once told me, "We program for people who can't afford cable or tapes or
disks."  

     Re: licensing...yes, since WB owns the copyright to B5 (just as Paramount
owns the copyright to ST), we have to license back anything we want to sell.

     No, the German and French stations have not been broadcasting in
widescreen, but have been negotiating for the right to do so in year 3.

                                                                jms
