     Re: the Hugos...I would not tend to consider the entirety of season two
as one dramatic unit because it's written by diverse hands, many different
writers.  I think you'd have to have an entire season written by one writer,
as a whole and undiluted dramatic unit, for that season to be eligible....

                                                                     jms
