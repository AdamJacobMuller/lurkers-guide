     At this point, I think I'd opt not to get into discussing ways to get the
film/TV companies involved more in SF fandom and the like, because sooner or
later that'd lead me back to the Dramatic Nebula discussion, and if we even
get *near* that one you would see a flamefest that would make the firebombing
of Dresden look like a tea party by comparison.

                                                                    jms
