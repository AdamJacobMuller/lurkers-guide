      We still have to license 'em from WB; we've been told it shouldn't be a
problem, but we get told that a lot, and 85% of the time it ain't true.  We
were told it shouldn't be a problem to get the fan club up and operating in a
few months; that was 2 years ago.

                                                                   jms
