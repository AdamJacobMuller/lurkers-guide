     I'd also point out that the film as it shows up on the stations is quite
a bit different from what I get in my master SVHS copies, and off the D1
masters.  Once we deliver the episode, it goes through several dubbing
processes by WB, one to insert commercials (where sometimes we get clipped,
and we sometimes get weird audio and video burbles, we get crunched, sometimes
there's analog/digital conversion going on), and then AGAIN when the episode
is copied again for closed-captioning purposes.   Then a new "master" is
struck for uplink.  During this process, I've seen a distinct increase in
graininess, it's a bit less sharp, and you get some odd stuff with audio being
out of phase.  

      It's nothing we can control, it's the facilities used by PTEN for
translation of the episode for broadcast.

                                                                   jms
