     Yes, I also like the more shadowy shots, which add a great deal of
texture to the show.

     When we go to do the videotapes for the fan club, we're tentatively
planning to go to the same company that did the dupes from masters for the
tape we did for the Television Academy, back when nominating time came around.
They were very good quality, on a par with the standard VHS copies I get
personally.  (I certainly couldn't tell any difference.)  

                                                                   jms
