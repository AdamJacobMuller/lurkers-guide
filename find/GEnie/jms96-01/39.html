     Right now, the plan, tentatively, is this: we would announce that say,
the first 8 episodes will be made available in a limited edition.   We would
take orders for that first batch for a specific period, say 30 days.  We would
then produce the tapes in the number ordered, and that would be it for a
while, while we moved onto the next series of episodes (9 through whatever). 
After working our way through the total available number of episodes, we'd
eventually work our way back to #1 again, though it might take as much as a
year, and subsequent editions would be noted as such.  

     This is still open to change, but that's what we're considering.  

                                                                jms
