     Re: history...there's a line I came across somewhere, "I have 25 more
years of experience than you do."  "No, you just have one year of experience,
repeated 25 times."

     Mike: that's a *great* report from Arisia, thanks; glad to hear it all
went well.  (And yes, of course, feel free to email the comments around;
anybody else wants to use them, that's fine too.)  To your notion (ah, the
birth of a notion) that current B5 fandom resembles the original ST
fandom...there may be something to that, I think.  In any event, thanks
again....
