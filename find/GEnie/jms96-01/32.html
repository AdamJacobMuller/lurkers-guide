      Today was a very interesting day; today Michael O'Hare returned to the
Babylon 5 stages in preparation for shooting the two-parter, which begins
tomorrow.  Today he came by for his wardrobe fitting and to get his hair
trimmed, say hi to folks, and hang out...lunch was me, John Copeland, Michael
and Bruce Boxleitner eating together at one of the tables in the lunch area
behind the stage, lots of laughing and kidding, and the two get on great. 
(Turns out they'd worked on other projects before, including the short-lived A
Rumor of War series by Sterling Siliphant.)  

      Anyway, it's a great atmosphere, and everybody's psyched for the two-
parter.  It's like he never went away.

                                                                  jms
