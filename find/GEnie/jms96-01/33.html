      Of course, it ain't just the media and comic cons that comp pros who
participate on panels...EVERY fan-run convention in the country that I know of
comps participating pros...Westercon, Loscon, Icon, Baycon, you name it.
 Some of them are big cons, some of them are small or medium cons; they all do
the same.  It's only WorldCon that breaks the pattern, thus one must ask for
justification.

                                                                        jms
