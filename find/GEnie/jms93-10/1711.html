     I genuinely don't think you'll be seeing much *anywhere* until just about
the time we hit the airwaves.  You want to put these things into catalogs and
stores when you think people will buy them...and right now, a lot of folks
still don't know about the show.  Don't worry, you'll be sick to death of the
merchandising soon enough....
