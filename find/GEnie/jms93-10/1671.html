     The points made above are essentially correct; the brand goes on in the
very top of the show, in the teaser, and stay on throughout the episode...and
part of the story is dealing with this, and what it means.   An offer is made
to remove it, but the victim decides *not* to have it removed, because there
are lessons in these things...and it becomes almost a badge of defiance.

     In addition to the notes here, I've received a whole bunch of email notes
saying to leave it in, on the grounds that it *does* happen in real life (or
incidents close to it), and how we're handling it *is* very different.  (Some
indicated that it can illustrate how the two shows handle their themes in
different ways.)  So it's a tough call...to change would also mean some re-
shooting...but given the responses here, I think it's okay to leave it in
place.

     File this one away the next time someone asks, "What sort of ways has the
BBS discussion actually affected Babylon 5?"
