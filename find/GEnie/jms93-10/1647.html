     Harlan very much believes and supports what we're doing here, and if you
know Harlan, you know what that means.

     Kiwi...understand that no changes are just made willy-nilly (to use your
term).  This is a STORY.  As with any story, any novel, you have your moments
of surprise, of sudden turns where you kick over all of the tables and watch
the pieces scatter.  But the writer already knows where the pieces will land.
It's all according to plan.  Nobody's going to be screwed over.  Anymore than
when somebody reading, say, a Stephen King book feels screwed over when
suddenly Salem's Lot, a nice quiet little town, suddenly gets filled with
undead and characters are suddenly going through some remarkable
changes...it's all part of the story.
