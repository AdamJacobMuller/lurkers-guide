     Brett...there was a situation in which the GEIs might have been called
upon to make a whole lotta phone calls, send faxes, and do other stuff to save
the project.  There was one brief moment when it looked like things were going
to fall apart.  But they didn't.  The crisis passed, and the details are
really not worth getting into now.  What's past is past.
