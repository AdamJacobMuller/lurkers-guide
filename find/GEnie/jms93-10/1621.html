     I haven't a *clue* to who will be watching the show, and to start
thinking that way, frankly, is like asking the centipede which foot it moves
first...it'll paralyze you every time.  What I'm doing is writing and
commissioning stories that I myself find interesting.  If my instincts are
right, others will like them as well...if not, well, that's showbiz.   I hate
the whole idea of demographics and testing, and generally won't listen when
the subject is brought up.  Tell the story first; if it's a good story, you'll
get viewers; if not, not.

     Mumy's role, to answer that question, is a recurring role; I think he'll
be in about half a dozen episodes or so for us.  To the best of my knowledge,
this won't interfere with any other obligations Mumy has.

                                                                    jms
