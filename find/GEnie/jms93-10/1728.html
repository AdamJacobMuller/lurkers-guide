     Okay, here's the info: I, Larry DiTillio, and possibly others will be
making a presentation at LosCon that Thanksgiving weekend on Saturday from 11
a.m. to 1 p.m.  We got a two-hour block because we may have some stuff to
unveil.  If you're in the L.A. area, and interested in B5, I wouldn't miss
this one.  As well as the possibility of some cast members, those who come may
get more than just a preview....

                                                                  jms

     (That's Thanksgiving weekend at the Burbank Airport Hilton.)
