     It's hard to mention companies in a TV show without getting permission.
(In my heart I'd love to see an ad for "IBM...a  Division of the Sony
Corporation.")

     What's the problem with passion?  Multifold.  Networks and studios are
often put off by it.  Passion isn't fashionable, and isn't usually very
saleable.  Also, so many have now been trained by film school to replicate
what they grew up with...combined with the many who've learned the Formula
from others or from the Script Gurus and hesitate to vary from that
formula...that it's just not done very often.

                                                                jms
