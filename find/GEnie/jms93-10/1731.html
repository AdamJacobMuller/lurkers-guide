     Yeah, easy for YOU to say, KAL...I've got Londo, Garibaldi, G'Kar, Kosh
and half the Psi-Corps running around inside my head and yelling at each other
24 hours a day...YOU try to sleep with all that racket.

     I either need to find a better neighborhood, or a worse one, I can't
decide....

     "AH, my GOOD, CLOSE FRIEND, GariBALdi --"

     That's it!  Everybody outta the pool......!
