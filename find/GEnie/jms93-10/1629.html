     The shooting schedule won't conflict with WishCon.  BTW, a note for
anyone who's sent anything to the address I posted here a few times before:
 one of the problems with shooting a series is that, well, time shoots past
you with remarkable speed...one minute you look up and it's August, the next
minute you look up and it's October, and...and....

     Okay, long story short: I forgot all about the mailing box, and it got
closed up.  Stuff was sent back.  I only just found out today, and re-opened
it.  Apologies to anyone who sent stuff there in the last few weeks.

                                                             jms
