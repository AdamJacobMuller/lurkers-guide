     We're assuming that the navy and airforce have more or less merged into
Earthforce, so there's influences from both sides.

     The fighters are in regular configuration when the pilot boards.   Then
the drop doors open, the ship tilts down on a massive pair of arms, and then
they're released, the centrifugal force of the station sending them out the
drop doors.  When they've gotten a bit away from the station, they hit their
engines.
