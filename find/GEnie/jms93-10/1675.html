     You have to understand that when I said "Let me introduce you to the
budget," I was talking primarily in TV terms.  The actors sometimes named here
-- from Mel Gibson on -- generally command salaries of $4-10 million per
movie.  Those actors are generally outside the reach of *any* TV series.  As
it is, we've managed to pull in some pretty amazing actors who would generally
be unattainable, but loved the scripts.

                                                                  jms
