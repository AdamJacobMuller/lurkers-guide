     I've never felt the need, as a writer, to be didactic about this stuff.
No, I don't believe in an afterlife...I also don't believe in the actual
existence of Vorlons, either, but I write about them.  I don't think it's a
requirement.  H.P. Lovecraft was one of our best writers of supernatural
fiction, but I very much doubt that he believed in the Old Ones, or made bi-
weekly offerings to Cthulhu.

     All areas of human endeavor should be open to exploration, discussion and
analysis, for what we can learn from them.
