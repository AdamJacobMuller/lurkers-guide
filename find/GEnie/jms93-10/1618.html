     I was going to swing by the box today, but ended up...well, here at the
computer.  Sigh.  It's turned into "Next year in Israel...."

     Yeah...I dimly seem to remember making a GBs presentation that year, so
that may have been me.  (In fact, I lost my copy of the tape I brought with me
in a hotel restaurant...which did contain special footage, and is thus gone
forever, at least for me.)

                                                                 jms
