     BTW, those Hour 25 posters, of which there are only a limited number
left, are in a sense the first (and possibly most interesting) collectible for
B5 afficianados.  The poster is of the logo for Hour 25, a radio show hosted
by Harlan, and then me.  It was on H25 that the first mention was made of B5;
also, the poster was designed by Peter Ledger, who did the art for B5 that
helped get the project sold; and it's autographed by Peter, me, Harlan Ellison
(conceptual consultant) and Larry Ditillio (our S.E.).  And of course it's set
in space.
