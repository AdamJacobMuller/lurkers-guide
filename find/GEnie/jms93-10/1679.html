     The starfury fighter is launched by a drop straight out, nose pointed
"downward," toward space.  Upon release, it flies pretty much straight out,
still containing some of the momentum from the rotation, so it would appear to
be going straight away from the station because its position in relation to
the station, like a geosynchronous satellite, is still more or less correct.
Shortly after getting out of the bay, the fighters fire up their engines,
which lets them take any angle or direction they choose.  So they can very
quickly head away on any trajectory.

                                                                  jms
