     Will advise on names when I have clearances.  These things take time.

     BTW, for those who might be interested in such things...continuing the
Earth tradition, all of our various fighter wings have their own names.  The
fighter unit that Ivanova belongs to, for instance, is the Ghost Riders.  The
name of Sinclair's Earth/Minbari War Fighter unit was Death's Hand.  We've had
patches made of these and other insignia, which get used at appropriate
moments on their flight suits in the cockpit.  (I don't remember offhand the
name of the primary fighter unit on B5, which is technically Delta Wing, but
it has a specific name beyond that, and it just fell out of my head.)

                                                                  jms
