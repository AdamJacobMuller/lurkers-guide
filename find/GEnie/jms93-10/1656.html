     I culled only the names I thought might work for us.  One problem with a
number of the suggestions was that while the names in question might work well
in writing, on a page or a screen, actors have to *say* these words out loud,
and some of them would've been very difficult to pronounce.  The name also has
to be recognizeable as, say, a corporation.   A couple of names sounded nice,
but could end up sounding just a part of the sentence, and we don't realize
that a corp name has gone by until too late.  This is the difference between
writing for a printed medium, and a dialogue/verbal medium.

     An interesting exercise, in any event.  Which is why I suggested it,
instead of just going with my own.  Again, we're here in part to go into the
process a bit.

     Meanwhile, back at the ranch....

     Have been down for a few days with the Babylon Bug, the flu that's ripped
through the stage and the offices and has hit just about everyone.  REALLY
nasty.  But the show, as they say, must go on, so we've been pushing ahead.
One slight alteration in schedule...on Monday some of the last scenes we
needed came in after the rotoscoping work was done, and since we finally had
all the parts, we went ahead and did the final mix on "Soul Hunter" over
Monday and Tuesday.  So I'm proud to say that that first episode is now 100%
complete and in the can.

     It makes a MAJOR difference to see these shows on film, color corrected,
with music, sound EFX, visual EFX, cgi and the rest.  It's a very solid
episode, very intense, and in many ways a one-hour movie, which is what I'd
like to see in the series overall...a cinematic style of storytelling.  The
music really drives the action, and the visual EFX (i.e., guns, rays, other
visual stuff that doesn't involve CGI) are just terrific.

     We do the final mix on "Midnight" next Monday, and will probably be doing
one mix per week thereafter, until the holidays.

     (Kevin, who does our visual EFX rotoscoping stuff does all this in his
home facility, on a Mac.  We got word this morning at 6:30 a.m. that his house
is right on the fire line at one of the big L.A. fires going on today.
Refusing to evacuate, he has spent all day alternatively on his roof, spraying
down the house and grounds, and in his home office, backing up all the B5 EFX
onto optical removeable drives, with a B5 runner standing ready, right there,
to yank the stuff and evacuate if need be.  It's some measure of the
dedication on this show that where other people might be loading up personal
belongings, he was mainly concerned with getting the B5 efx out the door in
case the worst happened.)

     (Apparently, as of this writing, all is still well with Kevin, and it
looks like the worst is past, as far as he's concerned, at least, though the
rest of the valley is burning....)

                                                                 jms
