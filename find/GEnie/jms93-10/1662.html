     It's the name on the patch, not the picture.

     According to press material released by Paramount, the "ST: Voyager "
series will involve a crew of young cadets on their first training mission.

     Don't yet know how the Paramount deal will affect us, if at all.  No one
at Warners seems terribly concerned about it, so my guess is that it really
won't affect us one way or the other, but that's only a guess.

                                                             jms

     (P.S. Kevin's place escaped the fire, all is well.)
