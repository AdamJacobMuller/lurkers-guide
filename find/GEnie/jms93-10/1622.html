     Well, we're currently in a one-week hiatus, to give our camera crew and
cast a well-earned break, so we were missing many of our core members at the
Sunday game, so Love and War won.

     Today, at Christopher Franke's, I heard the music for "Soul Hunter," and
it's brilliant.  It's very hard to describe...it's not rock, but it's
aggressive, and powerful, not at all synth sounding.  And I think that he just
may have resolved the sound in space question for the most part.  He tried
some things we discussed, and it works great.  So this may be the solution
we've been looking for.  (Though the first one who tells me there's no
orchestra in space gets it in the eye.)

                                                                 jms
