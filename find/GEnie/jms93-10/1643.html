     We've already instituted the need for translation devices on several
characters.  There are basically three dominant languages on B5, a kind of
interstellar esperanto, Centauri, and English, which is the more or less
official military/diplomatic language.  But not everyone is going to know
those languages, so you need another way.  We have translation teams
(referenced though not seen in "Soul Hunter"), and physical translation
devices for use after we've had sufficient contact with a given group or
individual to be able to decode two languages into one another.

     (Incidentally, we're going with a slightly different version of English
for things like airlocks and such, alongside the visual pictograms.  Not
everyone who can speak english will have an immediate grasp of the intricacies
of the language, and there have been multi cultural/esperanto like influences
on English over the next 200 years.  So for things like Universe Today, you
have standard conventional English, since that's primarily an Earther-oriented
publication.  But then you have signs that read, for instance SECUR AREA, with
an accent over the U.  We've taken the liberty of simplifying some aspects of
english for nonhumans, as well as trying to figure out how the impact of multi-
culturalism might affect language ovese of 200 years.)

     We've shot our first scenes between Sinclair and his new love interest,
Catherine Sakai (as played by Julia Nickson).  This is a very, very strong
character, and she brings a wonderful vibrancy to Sakai.   They have a unique
relationship that looks and sounds like a real relationship, with all its ups
and downs and dumb moments.  One way that I've reinforced this is that...well,
in the first episode in which they meet again (they were involved before),
just about every scene between them is lifted almost directly from personal
experience.

     And given some of the awkward, even painful conversations that take
place, it was very, *very* hard to watch this being rehearsed.  (Michael and
Julia worked over a weekend with the director to get the nuances just right.)
When it came time to shoot the scenes, much as I wanted to be on-set, I just
couldn't do it.  My heart just kept falling right down to my shoes.  I can't
wait for the first person to say "I don't buy this as a real relationship"
just so's I can whap him upside the head.  But I have a hunch that won't
happen.  It comes across as very real, and as a very vulnerable moment for
both characters.

     "Write what you know," they said.  Right.  How about I just take a power
drill and stick it in my ear...it'd be faster, less painful, and after a while
I might even come to like it....
