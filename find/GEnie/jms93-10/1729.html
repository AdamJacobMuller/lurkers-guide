     Several corrections.  Neither Knight One nor Knight Two are Psi Cops.
Everyone assumed that they were, but I never said that, and it's not the case
at all.

     Danica McKeller does not appear in "Sky," she appears in "The War
Prayer;" David McCalllum appears in "Infection."  Christy Marx's episode is
entitled "Grail," and that's the one with David Warner, William Sanderson and
Tom Booker.  "Metaphors" and "Target" have been retitled.

     Those are the errors I caught just in passing.

                                                                   jms
