     Hmm...maybe I should amend it to "No cute kids, no cute robots, and no
filkers, ever...."

     Nothing personal, but given the choice between listening to two hours of
filking, and having my eyeballs scooped out, popped, spread on toast as jam
and fed to me for breakfast...I'll take the latter.

     BTW, something I forgot to mention (and I guess this should really go
under B5 Sightings, but I'm here, I'm lazy, and I'll forget again), Danica
McKillar (I think I've got that spelling right) has a modest but interesting
part in an episode we just finished filming.  The crew from Entertainment
Tonight came by and did some filming of her in wardrobe (as a young Centauri
woman), and I think it'll probably show up Monday or Tuesday or thereabouts.

                                                               jms
