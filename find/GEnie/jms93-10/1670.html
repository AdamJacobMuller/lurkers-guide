     Kiwi...yeah, I know.  We're in discussions to see if there's any way we
can cut this from the show...the only problem is that the brand stays on
throughout the show.  If it were just in one shot, we'd cut the shot and find
some other way around it.  The only way we can lose it now would be if we
literally wiped off the brand by going into every frame in which it appears
and digitally removing it from the frame...which is a *real* pain in the
butt...but we are considering it.

                                                                  jms
