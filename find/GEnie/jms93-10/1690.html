     Whether it's two or three...who can keep count?...the newsletter was a
private thing developed in-house for the movie, and to segue into the series;
it was never meant to be a permanent fixture.  (And I'm sure that PTEN will
probably initiate its own publication after a while, if we're properly
successful.)  After the initial full run, it's really up to Christy whether or
not she decides to carry on with the thing for a while.
