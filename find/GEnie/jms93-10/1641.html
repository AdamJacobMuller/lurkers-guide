     I actually felt kind of awkward watching the ET piece, because here we've
got all these amazing prosthetics, many of which you could see on the wall,
and this "oooh, we're alien" process of becoming a centauri is basicall a bald
head and ponytail.  I dunno...just felt funny, given what goes into making the
REALLY alien characters we're using.

                                                                    jms
