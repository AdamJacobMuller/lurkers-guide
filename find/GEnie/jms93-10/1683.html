     Bear in mind that the amount of counterthrust diminishes the more
detailed and precise your movements become.  You need a big thrust at one or
two points for the big configurations, then as you start to narrow it down,
the thrusts get smaller and more precise and are less visibly noticeable.
We're talking microthrusts here.
