     Pass....

     BTW, speaking of satellite stuff, 35 minutes of B5 promos and other
stuff, some of it edited to include the Emmy info (but based insofar as I know
only on the pilot material, nothing new) will be downlinked on Galaxy 4,
Channel 21, same audio figures as Fenn gave, Friday the 15th from  9-9:45 ET,
Sunday the 16th from 8-8:45 ET, and Monday the 18th from 1:15 to 2:00 p.m. ET.
(The first two times given are also PM.)

                                                                 jms
