     You're looking at the wrong part of the station.  Run the tape, and
you'll see several segments that track alongside the round front of the
station, and revolve along with it.  (Remember where the spider transport
attached itself?  I seem to recall that was on one of the cobra arms.)   So
we're still using centrifugal force to launch.
