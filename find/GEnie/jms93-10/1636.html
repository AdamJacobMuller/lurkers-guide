     Unfortunately, I don't know the internal configuration; the computer was
custom assembled by someone who's no longer local.  It's a hodgepodge of
components collectively named the Deathstar 2000 Megasystem.  So the only way
I can find out is to open the sucker up, which I suppose I'll have to do...as
soon as I can move aside the stacks and stacks of comic books in front of
it...and scare away the balrogs....
