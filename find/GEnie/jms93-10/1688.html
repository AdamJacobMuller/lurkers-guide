     I'm told it'll be soon.  The problem was multifold: 1) Christy had this
really impatient producer yelling on her for a script, which she finally
turned in, and will star David Warner; 2) she's in the process of buying a
house and moving; 3) she's been yelling on me for an intro piece, which I keep
missing; and 4) because of the changes in cast, she had to interview all of
the new cast members, who will be featured in the next issue.  There are only
two issues left in the run in any event, and in a way, the later the issue,
the more complete the information will be.
