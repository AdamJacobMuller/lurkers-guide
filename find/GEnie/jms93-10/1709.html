     No, there's no reference to B5 in the Hour 25 poster...only that it was
painted by the same man who did our original B5 artwork, used to help sell the
series, and is signed by him (Peter Ledger), as well as by me, Larry DiTillio
and Harlan Ellison...the first official grouping of what would become the B5
core.
