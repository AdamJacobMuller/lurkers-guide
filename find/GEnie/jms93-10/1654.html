     Yes, we're going to keep the general structure of the narrative, from
black to the star rising, to B5, though the new narrative will be a bit more
historical in nature.

     BTW, guess which certain series just acquired a whole bunch of Toasters,
is under pressure to lower the budget, and is trying frantically to catch up
with a certain other show's use of CGI...?

                                                                jms
