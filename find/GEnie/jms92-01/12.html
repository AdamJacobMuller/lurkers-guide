     I know what happened to B-4.  And to B-3, 2 and 1.

     Bear in mind, this thing has been in secret development for three years.
During that time, with the script and artwork and bible finished, all I COULD
do was background the story to the Nth degree.  I now know far more than I
ever thought I would about the universe of BABYLON 5.

     And what happened to B-4 will at one point come back to, um, "haunt"] B-
5.
