     Here, after many consultations with Wise Men Who Weild Great Power, is
where things stand for now, I think.

     1) Apparently, B-5 met with a *very* positive reception at the INTV
conference in San Francisco.

     2) Our contract with WB and the independents stations guarantees our
production as a movie, with the series still very solid.

     3) The B-5 movie is going to air this year, in the fall/winter.  There is
no conceivable way that anyone else can beat us to the punch on that.  It WILL
be made, and it WILL be aired on schedule.

     4) Given that there is going to be a lot of PR attendent upon the airing
of B-5, it would seem counter-productive for any other studio to watch a well-
publicized movie being aired in 1992, and then come out with a similar concept
in 1993.  There would be no question as to who was there first, and the
newcomer would, I think, be viewed as less than original.

     So for now, we're hanging fire and waiting.  In two weeks is NATPE the
*main* marketing gathering for independent TV stations.  And stations will
have to decide whether they want a show that's ready to go NOW, or something
very tenuous that will take another year.  And, again, we are LOCKED IN to the
stations that form the consortium, and they include many of the top stations
and top markets in the country.

     So we'll see.

                                                                   jms
