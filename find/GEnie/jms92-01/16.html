     Two responses: on the input side, we don't have a strong network hand to
worry about on the material.  Thus far, they've had zero creative notes.  One
individual had one suggestion, which made sense, and has been implemented.
That's it.  Nothing from Warners at all.  My associate on the project, Doug
Netter, also tends not to get involved in story.  "I'm not the writer, you're
the writer, you figure out what you want to do with this" is his usual
comment.  When we worked together on CAPTAIN POWER, he said he would never
give me a creative note because he wasn't a writer, and he held to that
promise.

     So to all intents and purposes...it looks like I'm going to be pretty
much left alone.  If we succeed, great, if we fail, this time I'll have no one
to blame but myself.

     As for alien-aliens vs. humans with bumps...bear in mind that as much as
we'd like to use REAL aliens, thus far we haven't encountered any.  So all of
the roles will have to be portrayed by humans, and we'll do as much as we can
to make them look as alien as possible.  And in some cases, as mentioned, we
won't ever SEE them because they'll be concealed inside atmosphere-controlled
encounter suits.  In the background, and where we can, we'll pepper really
unusual looking aliens into the show, but bear in mind that if we're going to
relate to these characters, and have our main cast relating to them, they have
to be understandable (to varying degrees), and because they'll have to emote
to one degree or another, we will have to leave some facial aspects free.

     But within those parameters, we're going to try some interesting stuff.
None of us much likes the "humans with head bumps" look, and we are all
dedicated to doing as much as we can to change that and come up with something
new.

                                                                 jms
