  That Which Cannot Be Named has finally been named, and the name is BABYLON
5.  An action-adventure SF series set in space.  To premiere sometime next
year with a two-hour TV movie, soon followed by regualar episodes if ratings
are good.  J. Michael Straczynski has said that people always complain about
SF not being done right on TV, well now it has a chance.

This series has a shot of making it if has the support of fandom.  So leave
your comments here and perhaps JMS will leave news and info here as the series
develops.
