     BTW...this Friday's HOUR 25 will be dedicated to the question of how one
gets a show on the air, the rigors and traps involved therein, and will follow
the long history of BABYLON 5 as an example.  (What a coincidence!)  Joining
me and my co-host Larry DiTillio will be B5 line producer John Copeland, and
EFX wiz from NewTek, Ron Thornton.

   Anyone in the LA area, feel free to tune in.  And if anyone wants to comment
on anything, the phones are open midway through the show....
