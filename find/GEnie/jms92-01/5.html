     For those into computer stuff, you may want to check message 403 in my
topic on Cat 8 for some info on what's being developed here in that area.

     In brief, we're going to be taking a completely different approach to EFX
than has ever been done before, using cutting-edge technology in creating the
images.  We've received massive support from one of the computer EFX companies
that's on the very edge of this stuff, one of the largest around.  We've
assembled quite a brain-trust.

     And here's a surprise for you: if you will find a copy of MILLIMETER
magazine -- I think it's either this month or the one just preceding it -- you
will find a computer-generated photograph that is described only as "a work in
progress" for an SF series.

     That is the first published photograph of BABYLON 5.

     (You see how sneaky we've been?  How quietly this has been going on?)
