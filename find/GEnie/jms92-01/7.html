     Agree re: female characters.  I very much want to see a woman in a
position of power who is perfectly well-adjusged, has good relationships, the
same basic number of character flaws as any other individual in the show...in
other words, a Person, not a stereotype.

     As for being "in the planning stage" above...incorrect.  We've been IN
the planning stage for three years.  Now we have a Go order for production,
which will commence in the spring on Phase One.

     As for the location...no, it's not a saloon or anything of that nature.


     And regarding the various characters...I *like* a mix of good and not-so-
good characters as regulars, people who are flawed, who you might enjoy
talking with, but you wouldn't necessarily turn your back on them.

     In terms of explaining the show, I've decided that the best way to use
this particular medium is to schedule out information.  We have about 10 or 11
months before Phase One hits the airwaves (which is actually fairly short for
a show of this scale).  Since there are 9 main characters in B-5, plus the
location itself, I figure one big release of info per month will carry us
through to broadcast.

     So on or about December 1st, I'll post here the info about exactly what
(and where) (and why) BABYLON 5 is.  Then one character description per month.
I'll also post a revised list of TV stations some time prior to broadcast to
handle the added locations.

                                                               jms
