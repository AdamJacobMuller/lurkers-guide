     Okay, for those interested, I now have a more specific schedule to work
from, based on our latest discussions with all parties.

     I finish my revisions on the 2-hour screenplay (entitled "The Gathering,"
for those interested) by February 1, about two weeks, give or take.  Then two
weeks to get in the notes from Warners.  Two more weeks to attend to whatever
suggestions they may have.  The screenplay is then locked down by March 1st.

     We go into design and casting March 1st.  Production design, art
design/directing and tech teams begin work.  We begin checking out the
director we're going to use.  First part of April we begin blueprinting of
sets and construction.

     We finalize cast and director by the end of May, and begin shooting June
1.  We finish shooting June 26th.  We go into editing and post production, and
come out with the finished film by early or middle October, and deliver to
Warners and the stations.  (By the first part of October we also deliver a
three-minute trailer to the stations for use in promoting B5.)

     BABYLON 5: The Gathering then airs the third week in November, during
sweeps.  Probably on a Tuesday night.

                                                                    jms
