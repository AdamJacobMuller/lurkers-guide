     Okay, I just read the pertinent notes on 21/21 regarding the new TNG
spinoff, and the "Jell-O Man," clearly (as indicated in the prior messages
there) a morph/shapechanger.

     Guess what?

     As I mentioned in 21/21, there was also a shapechanger on the B5 station
in the screenplay that Paramount has had now for some time.

     What *I* like is the fact that in the current version of the script, I'm
omitting the shapechanger because that technology is, in my view, overexposed
right now.  By the time it hits the air, morphing will be so common that it's
old hat.  (It WASN'T old hat when I wrote the original screenplay several
years back.  That was the goal with the current rewrite...to make the script
as far in advance NOW as it was when I first wrote it.)

     And the coincidences just keep on coming....

                                                                 jms
