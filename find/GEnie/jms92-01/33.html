     I don't yet know which stations in Canada will be carrying B5.  Once I
have a comprehensive list of stations, I'll post it.

     Okay, folks, listen up:

     You say you've been hearing about this Babylon 5 station.  You say you'd
like to know what it's gonna look like.  You say you'd like to know how big it
is.  Well, step right up, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, here's your
chance to see just what the heck we're talking about.

     Proceed immediately to your nearest magazine rack.  Pick up issue #4 of
STARLOG SPECTACULAR, which just hit the stands.  Turn to page 54.  And there,
in full color, is a half-page photo of the Babylon 5 space station from a
frontal three-quarter angle shot.  The little ship about to pull into the
docking bay is about the size of a 727, and the station is built to scale.
You can see the main airlock starting to iris open, and the blue things right
on the very edge of the picture are the solar collectors.

     You'll notice the modular sections, for the varying gravities, as
discussed.  And there are ports, an observation deck, and the like.

     Now mind you, this is a *fairly* early version of the station, so it's a
bit cleaner than what we'll see in the final version.  But this is pretty
close.  (We'll also make the station a bit darker, closer to steel grey...the
photo has it kind a bit lighter than that.)

     Anyway, there is it.  Anyone who'd like to digitize it and upload it here
as a GIF file is welcome to do so.

     (Note: the photo doesn't identify the station as B5 because at the time
the article was being prepared, B5 was still TWCBM, That Which Couldn't Be
Mentioned.  Top-secret.  And we didn't yet know what the time-frame was.
NewTek is permitted to use the material to show its capabilities, but at that
time was not allowed to identify it.  In future, that proviso will not be in
force.)

     It's rough, and it's being revised, but it's there.

                                                                  jms
