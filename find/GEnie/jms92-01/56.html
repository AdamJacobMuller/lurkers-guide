     YAAAAAGGGGHHHH!

     Stop-stop-stop-stop-stop.

     One hard-nosed Absolute Enforceable here: tech stuff is one thing, but
the telepath discussion is ranging into concrete story ideas, and that opens a
LOT of danger for me, particularly since a couple of things hit upon here are
in the script as it stands now.  (Answer: yes, I *am* ahead of you, Correa.)

     Please, that's the only request I have to make in this regard: NO STORY
IDEAS OR SUGGESTIONS.  We are in deeply litigious times.  Just today I
received a legal piece of paper from a pinhead in Georgia who thinks I swiped
his idea for a ZONE, and that's probably going to involve lengthy legal stuff
to prove that I didn't do it.  (The script, and the material on record BEFORE
the script predates his material by a long, long, LONG time.  He knows this,
but is going ahead anyway in hopes of harrassing the studio and me into making
a settlement to dispense with this...which AIN'T gonna happen.)

     Anyway, the point being this becomes very problematic.  So while we will
let stand what's here, please, no more on this approach.  Thanks.

                                                                jms
