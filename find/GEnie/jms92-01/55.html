     I'm trying to decide if I actually want to upload the final version or
not.  Well, not so much if I *want* to...I do...but whether or not I should.
The problem, basically, is one of control.  How can you tell if something -- a
flyer, a release, a piece of art or a shirt -- is an authorized piece from B5
Central, or something counterfeit?  That logo is a pretty good means of
telling the difference.

     Once the final image is uploaded, it becomes easily distributed, and that
*may* open up difficulties.  It's something I'm going to have to think about a
bit longer.  In the interim, take what's there and imagine it rendered in
solid, stainless steel, with a silver trim running around the edge of the
whole thing, giving it a 3-D look, and instead of solid colors, as it is now,
the colors look airbrushed or reflectorized, as though made of coppor and gold
catching the light and throwing it back.  THAT is the final (for now) version.
If that undergoes further changes -- I'm giving thought to making the word
BABYLON bigger, as though cut from a solid steel template -- then I will have
no compunction about putting up Logo 2.0.

     Does that make sense?

                                                                  jms
