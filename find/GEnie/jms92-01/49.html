     Sorry for the absence; was up to my ears in alligators.  Just time for a
quickie...the show has now been sold into a LOT more markets, and I should be
able to post the new station list here in the next week or so.  It met with a
VERY enthusiastic response.  Nothing but continued support.

     Will bring in some new info in another week or so also regarding the show
per se.  And while I'm not sure exactly what's meant by "expand" the idea, I
*do* like a show that grows and changes a little from time to time.  Shifting
relationships, the occasional character who goes off or gets croaked, changes
in character that catch you by surprise, so that will definitely be the case.

     My problem right now, in looking over the B5 screenplay, "The Gathering,"
is one of personal overload.  There's so much that I want to get into this,
but if you lay in *too* much backstory and exposition, you get dull REAL fast.
So that points you in the direction of action.   Too much action undercuts the
character/backstory/offbeat stuff that will make the project DIFFERENT.  It's
got to be accessible enough for reg'lar folks, at least for the movie, but
strange/SFish enough to let the fnas (or fans) of the genre now we mean
business.  Agh!

     I think I'll go lie down....

                                                                 jms
