     Yes, at this stage, we're going to use computer-generated images for the
exterior of Babylon 5.  Done right, you won't notice the difference between
that and a model.  (In fact, some of the SFX guys to whom we've shown a later
version of the demo tape were absolutely unaware that they were looking at
computer EFX; they thought it was a model...and these guys are experts.  They
also thought it must've been one hell of a miniature, given the detailing and
depth of the thing.)

     The cost is *slightly* less than with a model...but what it gives us is
truly ASTONISHING options.  For instance...we have a ship waiting outside B-5,
awaiting the word to proceed into the docking bay.  We can go from the POV of
the ship to B-5, out of the ship, approach the station, go up to a viewing
port, through which we see our characters in a live, filmed scene, and push
THROUGH the port RIGHT INTO THE SCENE, all in ONE CONTINUOUS CUT.  And what's
cool is to see them from the space side of the "glass" first, and we can't
hear what's being said, since there's no sound in space.  Then just as we push
through into the room, THEN we suddenly hear the dialogue, as if we've
penetrated a membrane.

     There are some really amazing things that we can do that, again, have
never been seen before, using the technology that's come along in the last few
years.
