     Thanks, any publicity helps.

     The NewTek scene being shown around is the early stage of the B5 concept.
There won't be a full-scale model built, it will exist entirely within the
computer EFX realm.  And the latest stuff I've seen is photo quality; you
can't tell.  I showed the new material to SFX guys who know the field inside
and out, and not ONE of them picked up on the fact that it was computer
generated until I told them.  They all thought it was a model.

                                                              jms
