     Some other info that I've been cleared to state:

     Phase One of BABYLON 5 -- the movie -- should air around October of  the
coming year.

     Phase Two -- the series -- is now slated for the following March.  We
figured close to that, but now it's on the dockets.

     Stations set to carry the project include: WWOR New York KCOP Los Angeles
WPWR Chicago KBHK San Francisco WDCA Washington D.C. KTXA Dallas KTXH Houston
WUAB Cleveland WTOG Tampa KMSP Minneapolis WDZL Miami KPLR St. Louis KRBK
Sacramento KUTP Phoenix WNUV Baltimore WTXX Hartford KPTV Portland, OR WSTR
Cincinnati KSMO Kansas City

     More stations will be added as we go.
