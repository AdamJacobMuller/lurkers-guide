     Small typo in the preceding: it should read that the Earth/Minbari war
lasted from 2236 to 2247, not 1147.

     This, by the way, represents only one small segment in the overall
history of the world of Babylon 5.  I've literally worked out a couple hundred
pages of condensed notes.

     So...whadaya think?

                                                                  jms
