     I would very much like to go for a soundless explosion...though logically
the shock wave from any near-proximity explosion would cause some disruption
in anything nearby, I would think.  So if, for instance, something exploded
near B-5, the ext. space shot of the blast would be soundless, but if we cut
to the int. of B-5, there would be some sort of vibration or similar
disruption, I should think.  (Hmm, I'd better look into that further,
since...well, never mind why.)

     Yes, some of this will be in the 2-hour movie, just enough to set the
stage.  As for Delenn, yes, he is of a somewhat philosophical bent, but he
takes great pleasure in his emotions, which is another difference.  And he
will look quite different.

     I've been trying to come up with a very off-beat plot turn to pull in
seasons 3 or 4 (assuming we ever GET that far, again, I'm working all this out
in advance and hoping for the best), and this morning I came up with something
SO neat, SO unusual, I practically slipped in the shower.  It's something that
has never, EVER been done in an SF series involving a major character.  And
boy, will this have major ramifications!  Too bad I have to wait so long to
pull it off.

     Oh...I forgot to mention one other thing about (then) Captain  Sinclair's
curious incident above (and yes, this will come up peripherally in the movie).
When he lost consciousness, he had 16 hours of oxygen left in his ship.  When
he awoke 24 hours later...he had 12 hours of oxygen left in his ship.

     Funny, ain't it...?

                                                                   jms
