     Why not?

     Besides, don't forget that humans have to be able to at least GET into
some of these areas if necessary, even though it may be extremely
uncomfortable.  (So okay, maybe 3Gs.)  Otherwise you find yourself in a
situation where an alien can do something destructive, escape to the high-G
sections, and no human can follow.  Seems kind of impractical.

                                                                 jms
