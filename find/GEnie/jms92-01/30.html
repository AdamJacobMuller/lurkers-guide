     J.LAHUE....clearly you haven't been getting NEARLY enough sleep.   Does
your mom know you're doing this?

     Regarding the WW II stuff...bear in mind that was the feathering of my
mind in the early stages.  That does not represent where the show is NOW, only
what process took me to this.  While I don't like any sort of analogy to what
went before -- only because it creates images and expectations that may not be
exactly the same, and for that matter should not be exactly the same -- the
"Casablanca In Space" log-line is the most accurate.

     As for SF influences in more general terms...I don't want to leave the
wrong impression.  I LIKE SF, and grew up reading it.  I don't have any
particular school (Analog vs. F&amp;SF) that I belong to, I just find what I like
and read it.  I suppose you could find the scope of the show in my
appreciation from youth of such books as the LENSMEN and FOUNDATION books, and
the CHILDHOOD'S END material.  That is the KIND of saga that I'd like to
present.  Too-hard, meaning too technical SF doesn't terribly interest me.
The technology is a means into the story, and should not (in most cases)
BECOME the story, unless you've got something really extraordinary on your
hands.  The story is how it AFFECTS someone.  (Kurt Vonnegutt's "Report on the
Barnhouse Effect" being a good comparison.)

     I suspect, as the program progresses, you'll catch little influences of
Bradbury, and Serling, and THE PRISONER (there's a certain surrealness in some
later stories I've planned out), with a healthy dollop of Clarke and Asimov
and Ellison.  But I don't think there's enough of any ONE to make a clear
distinction.

                                                                jms
