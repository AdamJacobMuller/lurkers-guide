     Actually, Eric, you're right one one important count...the hydroponics
will be at the center of the station, as you describe...and that section will
indeed be known as The Garden.  Which has both resonance from the original
Gardens of Babylon, to a certain Judaeo/Christian myth, both of which will
gain more resonance as the story develops over the long term.

     Found a way around the problem I'd mentioned, and now things seem to be
back on track.  Also found out Friday that a really NIFTY effect I'd hoped for
can, indeed, be done for the show.  I won't elaborate except to say that we
can show a ship arriving like nobody's ever seen before.  It's gonna be nifty.

     Also got some other good news on Friday from NATPE, but I'll have to wait
a few days before I can announce anything about it.

                                                                 jms
