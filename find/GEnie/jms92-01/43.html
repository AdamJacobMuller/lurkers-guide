     Yes, it was BABYLON 5 in the CNN Showbiz Today clip from Newtek.   For
those who missed it (*I* didn't know it was on until I heard it on another
system!), it'll be on again tonight at 2 a.m. Pacific, 5 a.m. Eastern time.

     I *think* I know what you're referring to re: Jello aliens, and will
check out the message.  If it is what I think, I may have another comment on
all this.

     Interestingly enough...originally the new TREK show was supposed to begin
PRODUCTION in Spring 93 for a debut Fall '93.  When we announced that we were
going to air the B5 movie in Fall '92, suddenly they moved the airdate for
*their* show to January 1993.

     This is, honestly, NOT a coincidence.  And I'm going to be amused to
watch them try to catch up...we've got a screenplay, a production team, visual
concepts, a bible, EVERYthing...and I *know* that they have only a
treatment...no series bible, no screenplay, nothing.

     This is getting more interesting by the moment....
