     I think someone else here might have the info on the GIF file.

     As for characters and story...that remains the first concern.  The
discussion here got a little EFX/tech heavy, but ain't nothing wrong with
that.  Bear in mind, also, that I can only reveal so much here without
compromising the movie.  There will already be, doubtless, folks who've seen
so much here that what would ordinarily have been suprising when the movie
airs will now seem expected...because they read it here.

     I'll pass on what I can, as I can.  Be assured, as a writer, story is and
will always be my first concern.

                                                                jms
