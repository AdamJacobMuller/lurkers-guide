     Thanks.  As mentioned, I'll probably layer out one character or setup per
month, rather than shoot it all out at once.  So for now, I'll be talking
about the world of Babylon 5, the background, Earth history and the like.  For
now, I'll say that there are basically five major Earth Alliance characters
who run the station, and four representatives, each from the other alien
confederations.

     And for those who've been asking repeatedly on another show for a woman
in a position of great responsibility, wait until you meet Laurel Takashima in
a month or two.

                                                                jms
