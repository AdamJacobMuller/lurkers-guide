     Actually, I hadn't yet given the planets in the neighborhood of B5 names
yet, only numerical designations.  Hmm.  I have to confess I rather like
Tigris and Euphrates.

     As for the jump-point...as it turns out, I moved it out QUITE a bit from
the station after my original posting.  The more I thought about it, the more
it seemed best to move it back.  (For one thing, I need to buy about five
hours from the moment A Certain Ship arrives through the jump-point, until it
decelerates enough to dock at B5, so that seems to indicate pushing it away a
bit.)

     Finally, as regards t-shirts...maybe.  Will advise.  How about this: the
B5 logo (the FINISHED version, which is 'way cool) on the front, and ACCEPT NO
IMITATIONS on the back...(smile, couldn't help myself).
