     Because of Babylon 5's function as a free port, the laws are a bit dodgy.
Outside B5 it's neutral territory, it's only when you set foot inside the
station that you fall under Earth Alliance regs.  Even so, you have to tread
carefully.  You raise some good points, and that is an issue that's going to
have to be dealt with.  Some sort of preventive measure would seem to be in
order...it's just a question of figuring out WHAT.

     Thanks for the comments...and the opinion, which is one that a lot of
others are coming to share re: the situation with That Other Show.
