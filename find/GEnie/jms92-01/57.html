     I'm not worried overly about anything here thus far, I only wanted to cut
it a little short before it got too problematic.  (Especially since one of the
points suggested is actually one of the main events in the movie.)  Don't mean
to inhibit anything, just a reminder, that's all.  And the Tigris/Euphrates
thing is something that's intriguing, and is still being considered, as is a
great deal of the tech stuff.

                                                                  jms
