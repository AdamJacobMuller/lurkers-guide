     For those who might be interested, I have just uploaded a file -- #3085 --
into library 5.  It's a .PCX graphics file that contains the BABYLON 5 logo.
I did the scanning myself, so it's a little rough around the edges, and it's
based on the initial draft of the logo, which is now being cleaned up.  But
this is fundamentally it.

     One note: please understand that this logo is both trademarked and
copyrighted, and is uploaded here ONLY for individual viewing.  Any other use
is strictly prohibited.

     Most graphics display programs like Compushow (CSHOW) will work just fine
on the file, as will Microsoft Paintbrush.

     For the show, the logo will be split at a diagonal, raggedly.  We will
see the two parts in space, rotating toward one another.  The line where the
two should join will begin to glow.  Music rises.  The two halves come
together with a FLASH of light, and we get a metallic looking complete logo,
looking like it's made out of heavy-gauge steel.  We then PAN OVER the logo to
reveal Babylon 5 in all its glory.


                                                                     jms
