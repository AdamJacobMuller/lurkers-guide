     BTW, this weekend I'll be at Stellar Occasion Convention in Dallas, at
the Executive Hotel in Love Field.  Claudia Christian will also be present.
I'll be giving two presentations, at noon and six p.m. Saturday, including a
showing of "Chrysalis."

     And maybe some other stuff.

                                                                  jms
