     At last, someone else who has seen the Leningrad Cowboys movie.  I
stumbled upon it on Bravo one night, about 45 minutes into it, and sat riveted
to the seat.  Literallly did not move, and discovered after a  while that my
arm was aching from where I'd been holding the remote the whole time.  Very,
very weird....

     Liked it.  Not sure why....
