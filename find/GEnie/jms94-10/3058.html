     Phil: there *is* a parting resolution/explanation for the Sinclair
situation in the first episode of next season.

     In two episodes, you will discover: a) what happened during the 24 hours
missing from Sinclair's memory; b) why the Minbari surrendered at the Battle
of the Line; c) what Delenn has turned into; d) what G'Kar found on his
expedition; e) the fate of Garibaldi...and a bunch of other stuff.

     How's that for starters?

                                                                  jms
