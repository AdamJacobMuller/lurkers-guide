     There really wasn't/isn't time in PoD to get into the angst everyone has
over Sinclair leaving (though some of that is given to Sheridan, oddly
enough).  But it WILL get brought up in subsequent episodes, especially from
Garibaldi.

     RE: Warner notes...mainly they're in areas of clarification, making sure
that we don't get obscure with some of the arc stuff.  Each episode HAS to be
clear to anyone coming in mid-stream, so they're helpful on that aspect.

                                                                jms
