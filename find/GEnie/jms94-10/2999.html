     T.J.Terru...ah, the famous archeaologist...my regards to Ruby and the
Android Sisters.

     Yes, have been in England, having left a week ago Saturday, and just
returning today.  Will post a longer note about this when I've fully recovered
(vacation, ha!).  We always give cast and crew a week break mid way between
the start of filming and the Christmas hiatus.  Tomorrow we begin shooting "A
Race Through Dark Places," with Walter Koenig.

                                                                   jms
