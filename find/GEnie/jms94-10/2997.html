     I received a lot of response, as noted above, from scientists (no less
than Freeman Dyson, for instance) who had frankly never really been ASKED
about the whole sound in space issue...and when they put their thoughts to it,
indicated that yes, there *would* be sound, of varying kinds and orders of
magnitude.  I've got it all in a big textfile, and hope to get around to
editing it for space and uploading it one of these days.

                                                                jms
