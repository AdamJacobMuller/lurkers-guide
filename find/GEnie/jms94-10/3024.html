     Generally speaking, Warners/PTEN leaves us alone.  Each season, as with
all TV shows, they tend to get involved in the first couple of episodes,
giving notes and wanting to see early cuts.  Since they have more time to
become involved, they do so.  This quickly phases down; we got a fair number
of notes on the first episode of both seasons of B5; less on the second;
single note on a script or cut since about #3, and we're currently up to #10,
script-wise.
