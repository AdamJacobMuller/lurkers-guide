     John: yeah, you definitely should've said something; we'd never put out
something like that.  As it turns out, we discovered that there were TWO comp
shots missing (including one in DownBelow), and that's how the "to be
continued" got added in at the end.  We rousted our people out of bed and had
them at the Modern Video facility at 2:30 a.m. fixing other people's mistakes,
rebuilding the entire episode so it could be birded out this afternoon.

     BTW, for those interested, Bruce will be on Tom Snyder show tonight.

                                                                  jms
