     What episodes to watch for in year two that are, variously, very
important or moderately important to the storyline....

     "Points of Departure," "Revelations," a piece of "The Geometry of
Shadows" but not all of it; portions of "The Long Dark," "GROPOS" and "A
Spider in the Web," and all of "A Race Through Dark Places" and "The Coming of
Shadows," with the latter two of critical importance.

                                                                     jms
