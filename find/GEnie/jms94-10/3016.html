     That's *exactly* what the soundtrack that Christopher has put together
sounds like...he's orchestrated music from all the episodes so that they segue
cleanly into one another, extending some, interpolating a bit here and
there...it's an hour or so of nonstop music, one big symphony.  Lovely,
absolutely lovely.

     (Again, I have one of the very few CDs he made to test this, and it's
terrific.)
