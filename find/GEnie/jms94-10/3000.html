     Re: any discussions in Showbiz or elsewhere about O'Hare, which I have
answered and answered until I'm blue in the face, and another new "true story"
comes out two weeks later that I have to deal with...I'll make a deal with
Warren and anybody else over there: I'll be happy to discuss this some more if
they'll give me the names and phone numbers of their last three or four
employers, so that I may inquire and find out the circumstances under which
they left THEIR last employment.  After all, by virtue of being on the nets,
which are public, and published electronically worldwide, they're public
figures as well...if they think this is fair game for others, then it should
be fair game for them as well.
