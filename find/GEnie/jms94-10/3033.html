      I believe some of the interviews for FutureQuest were performed in the
B5 central corridor.

     Re: magazines...yes, in the UK there are even some mainstream mags  and
newspapers discovering the show.  The Radio Times gave it a glowing review,
the Times called it superior, the Evening Standard called it
spiffing...Starburst has done one or two covers on the show, as has TV Zone
(to whom I gave an interview while in London).

     In the US, Cinefantastique has given it the cover twice.  Note that
Starlog has not done so once.  Personally, I won't have anything to do with
the magazine, because of their tendency to get stuff wrong, and because
they're primarily a ST/Paramount mouthpiece.  The editor there has told people
that even though they give covers to less highly rated shows like Highlander,
they'll *never* do a B5 cover because it would piss off Paramount.  And they
never have.  (Just one more reason why I won't in any way cooperate; I can't
prevent, and wouldn't try to prevent, my cast from doing so, because it's a
free country and they deserve the exposure.  I  don't think the second-rate
treatment is appropriate, personally.  Just shows you where their head is.)

                                                                   jms
