      So what was the (non-spoiler) reaction of the crowd at Farpoint to the
"Chrysalis" showing?

     Filming started this week on "A Race Through Dark Places," with Walter
Koenig back as Bester.  Going well.  Late next week we start shooting Peter
David's script, "Soul Mates," guest-starring Lois  Nettleton and Jane Carr as
two of Londo's wives, and Keith Sarabeca (not one of Londo's wives) (and I
think I just misspelled his name).

                                                                  jms
