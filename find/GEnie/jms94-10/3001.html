     There were a lot of ganged repeats due to the fact that we went on the
air in January, and they wanted new shows to stretch to the November sweeps.
Now we're going on in November, and can last fairly easily  through to the May
sweeps with fewer reruns (not as long a stretch), so there may be some relief
here.
