     Johann...ah, was that you?  Should've identified yourself.

     (BTW, I was rather nonplussed when, upon arriving at the con, I was told
that my escort/runner/driver for the duration of the con was a fellow who went
by the nickname Shadow (albeit spelled Shaddo).  Sort of caught me up short,
to say the least (they ARE everywhere).

     Nothing firmed up yet about other cast/crew at LosCon.

                                                                  jms
