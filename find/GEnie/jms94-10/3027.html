     Klaatu...I can probably answer your question a little better after you've
seen the second episode of this season.  For now, let's just say this: in
working out the story for year two, Sinclair's main line of connection was to
the Minbari.  But the Minbari storyline was diminishing in ways connected to
the war in year two; obviously we all know what is on the upswing in year two,
certain dark forces.  I needed someone who has a connection to *that* side of
the story to personalize it, and Sheridan brings that connection to the mix,
although he doesn't know it yet.

                                                                   jms
