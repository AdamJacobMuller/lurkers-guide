     Yes, Ivanova is already second in command; she gets promoted to Commander
rank in episode 3.  They got it wrong.  Also...lemme see if I've got this
straight...we put 50 ships in an episode, introduce new Earthforce ships,
carriers, you name it...TVG doesn't blink...DS9 puts ONE new ship in their
show and they get a two-page spread?

     Linda: thanks.  "Stupid fan remarks" are always welcome, just as one hope
stupid producer remarks are sometimes welcome.....
