     I know Foundation is working on some other projects, so there is time for
that, they just assign different animators to different projects.  I think ST
would never come to Foundation.

     Lately the CGI work has been fairly intensive because of some very
effects-intensive shows, specifically parts of "Geometry" and "A Distant
Star."

     A number of people have asked if we'll ever see the inside of hyperspace,
or the POV of a starfury pilot as he drops...and the answer  to both is yes.
Ron's first pass at hyperspace was, I thought, a bit too
Spielberg/Disney/pretty pictures.  I really felt strongly that hyperspace
should be a *scary* looking place, a dangerous place.  And Ron came back with
some really nifty stuff, a vaguely dream-like/nightmarish quality to it.

                                                                   jms
