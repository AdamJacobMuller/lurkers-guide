     As a rule, no.  In some rare cases, if we're hooking a story to something
close in the actor's background, we'll talk to them a bit, but the cast never
sees a script until it's hit Final Draft stage, at which point very little is
changed.  Sometimes on set an actor may want a line phrased differently for
performance, but that too is fairly rare.

     Actors are not writers, and writers are not actors.  (In general.)
There is a gross misunderstanding of the role of the actor in determining what
happens in a script.

                                                                 jms
