     Centauri were available to be slapped under a microscope if they WISHED
to be slapped under a microscope.  To them, we were the ones they chose to
study, and wouldn't be so undignified to submit to our examination.  They're
rather haughty sometimes.  It was a long time before we were able to get some
decent material to examine.
