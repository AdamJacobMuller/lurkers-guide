     I've tentatively spiked "The Customer is Always Right" (a non-arc story)
because ST did something on a similar topic, and I think I've got something
better for that slot anyway.

     I love "The Coming of Shadows."  It's one of those episodes that just
knocks the breath out of you.  You know those moments when you're in the
passenger seat of a car, and the person driving is doing something crazy, and
your foot automatically keeps searching for a brake pedal that isn't there
because you know something awful's going to happen?  That's the feeling you
get all through that script.  This episode, like "Sky," "Signs," "Chrysalis"
and "Revelations" again changes the direction and ratchets everything one
notch tighter.  It's also a very visual script, and I like that, since I
sometimes do rely too much on dialogue from time to time, and it's good to go
in a different direction.

     Kosh has just two words in this episode...and, again, they'll send a
chill right down the spine.

     Ah loves it....

                                                                  jms
