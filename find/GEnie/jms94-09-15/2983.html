     Yeah, it really is a cool book.  It's a very personal way of doing a bio,
and at the same time providing a good look at America from 1927 through
1994...through wars, and blacklisting, and social changes.  The fake letters
sent to the DGA documentary committee alone are worth the price of
admission....
