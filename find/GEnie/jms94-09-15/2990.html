     BTW, a company named All-U, which does t-shirts and other stuff, has
signed on to do some B5 shirts as well...and I gotta tell you, these are
really very cool.   Nicely done, well designed...a lot of thought went into
them.  And what's really amazing is that they've come up with some process
that lets them put down photographic-level images, and lots o white (and color-
on-white) WITHOUT bulking up the colors so that you can feel them stubbing out
from the shirt.  The designs feel like any other part of the shirt.  *Very*
nice (in fact, I'm wearing one as I type, a multicolor shot of the station,
the nebula, the logo, and "The Last, Best Hope...Babylon 5").  Really nifty.
