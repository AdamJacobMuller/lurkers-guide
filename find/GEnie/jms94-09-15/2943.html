     Telepathic scans of suspects in a criminal case are *absolutely NOT
admissible* in court.  They are prohibited from it.  Because it puts FAR too
much power in the hands of telepaths, power that the judicial system would
never, ever in a million years part with.  It destroys the idea of due
process.  You have to be sure that the telepath isn't lying, which means you
bring in a second telepath to verify the first, and a third to verify the
second.  Further, a person may feel responsible for someone's death ("I said,
`I hate you, I hope you did,' and then she did, it's my fault!"), without
being so.

     The recent introduction of telepaths into the military is a very
controversial decision, and is being fought vigorously.  It was put in on the
theory that in wartime, soldiers do not have quite the same rights as
civilians.  This is being contested hotly back in the Earth senate, and I
wouldn't be surprised to see it overturned.

                                                                   jms
