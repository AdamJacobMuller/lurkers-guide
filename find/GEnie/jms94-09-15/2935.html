     We've designed much of our medical equipment around suggestions made by
our medical science consultants, who generally feel that we'll be using more
light-oriented healing technology and non-invasive procedures.  And we used
the 3D imaging process for the interior of a body cavity in "Believers."  A
few weeks ago we got sent a clipping from some medical newspaper overseas
showing a new kind of medbed that looks a lot like the one we use in medlab,
with the monitoring cage overhead.

     We *do* consult in this and other areas.  Sometimes what's projected may
not be what someone else would project, but please don't take that to mean we
haven't checked.  We have.

     Tom: in general, the schedule is comparable to the best situations I've
found before, if not better, on network shows.  The bulk of that due, again,
to the fleet-footedness of our crew.

                                                                  jms
