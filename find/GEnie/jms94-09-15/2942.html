     Let me be absolutely clear: if B5 should fall in the syndicated market,
the WB network will *not* pick it up.  Neither could we take it to any other
network for a period of 2 years (by contract), which is the same as preventing
it altogether since you'd lose your cast and crew in that amount of time.

                                                                 jms
