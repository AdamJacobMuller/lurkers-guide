     Hard to confirm much of anything, since I was only just notified of the
presentation late this evening; nobody had said boo to me about it prior to
this.  So my info is as good as yours at this point, so thus far, yes, it'll
be Sunday (hadn't even *heard* about anything Saturday).

                                                                jms
