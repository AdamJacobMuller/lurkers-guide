     Don't know how much impact will come from the rerun schedule; you'll know
when I do.

     And vice-versa.

     Well, I've now seen 3 completed (sans some CGI and other stuff) episodes.
The first one is very good.  I think "Revelations" is even better (#2), mainly
in that it feels to me a lot like "Chrysalis," lots of *whams* all over the
place.  But curiously, my favorite so far I think is #3, "The Geometry of
Shadows," and I think it'll become a favorite with viewers as well.  It's just
an *awful* lot of fun.  It's very funny in places.  And here's something that
may surprise you: a number of folks didn't much like Vir in year one.  I think
you're going to like Vir a LOT in year two.  We're building up his spine, to
stand up to Londo, and doing a lot more with him.  Also, Vir is in the
unenviable position of being the one who sees where Londo is going, and
despite his attempts to stop things, can't...like someone seeing a car
accident in slow motion.

     Anyway, I was watching the producers' cut of "Geometry" tonight and just
*howling*.  It's the kind of show I love most, that's funny one moment, then
scary and ominous the next.  I love that contrast, and it's very hard to pull
off without seeming forced.  This one came out just right.

                                                                  jms
