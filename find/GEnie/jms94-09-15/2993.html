     No, no funky pyramid stuff.  The mural that dominates the casino traces
human history/technology.  It goes from the beginnings of civilization in
Egypt, the "cradle" of civilization in that region (left hand corner) and as
it moves left-to-right shows horse-drawn carriages then villages then cities
then megacities, planes, jets, starships, and finally ends with B5 up in the
right-hand top corner.

                                                                 jms
