     That is, unfortunately, the problem with "filming" in space; it's ALL in
focus because of the lack of atmosphere, which provides a slight haze that
cues us to distance.  (Which was why they put the Hubble in space, after all.)
If you look at footage from the Apollo missions, or the joint Soyuz missions,
when one ship moves to dock with the other, it's very disturbing visually
because from a distance, to close up, the other ship is crystal clear.  It's
also very difficult to judge size when there's nothing of absolute size beside
it.  If B5 were floating next to a football field, you'd know instantly how
big the thing was.  We're trying to find ways to work around this....
