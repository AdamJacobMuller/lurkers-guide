     Thanks; some of the writing for the column on the personal side was very
difficult...glad to hear it was useful.  Re: OK cons...nothing at this time
scheduled.  I try to keep it down to a minimum, usually maybe 5-6 in a year,
not much more than that.  I just don't think I have that much of interest to
say to folks....
