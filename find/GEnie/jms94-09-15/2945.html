     Re: religious people not necessarily *acting* religious, or doing a
religious thing in the course of a show...hey, I was on Murder, She Wrote for
two years...don't recall one episode where we showed Jessica Fletcher typing
for any period of time.

     ST's treatment I would put in a separate category, because there does
seem to be some element of an agenda there (or, stated less pejoratively, a
different point-of-view on the subject).  Mainstream TV has, I think, done
very well in this area, all things considered.

                                                                   jms
