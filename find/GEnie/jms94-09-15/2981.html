     Tape hell...laserdisk.  (Also a big Meatloaf fan.)

     First time I ever saw "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" it was in college,
with a young woman who dragged me to it.  As we stood in line, a cool but not
terribly cold night, I noted that she was wearing a rather large overcoat.
She explained that it was the kind she tended to wear to TRHPS
screenings...she showed me how she'd cut the ends off of the pockets, allowing
her hands to come through to the inner part of the coat.  I inquired about why
this was done.  "So I can diddle myself while I watch the movie," she said.

     I have absolutely no recollection of the rest of the evening.
