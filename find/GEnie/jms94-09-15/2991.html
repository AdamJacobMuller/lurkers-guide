     I know the guys from All-U are over on Prodigy, looking for some quotes
for shirts (or AOL, I can never keep them separate), so someone from there
probably has more info.  But they should be generally  available soon.  The
one I nabbed was the prototype.

     To try and keep the novels canon, I'm going to *try* and work in a brief
reference to the event on B5 that takes place in "Voices," made after the
fact, just a throwaway.
