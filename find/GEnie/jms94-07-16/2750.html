     Yeah, I had the same conversation...suggested a structure rather like the
Winds of War, set during the Earth/Minbari War, in that we have all of our
characters in different places, seeing the story and the war from their
perspectives, and how their paths intersect during that time in odd or
unlikely ways.  Dell didn't think that was the way to go, that unless it was
set in the present, people would feel disappointed.

     Oh, well...eventually we'll get around to that part of the story.
