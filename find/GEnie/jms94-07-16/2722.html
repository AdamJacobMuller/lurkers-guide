     Basically, I thought "Legacies" was pretty good, all things considered.
I'd put it at around the center of the pack.  It didn't exactly leap off the
boards at me, but I didn't have any major problems with it, as I did with, for
instance, "Infection."  (Like the CGI composite shot of the rotunda, looking
out at the garden before panning down a lot.)
