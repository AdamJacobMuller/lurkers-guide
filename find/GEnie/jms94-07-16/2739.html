     This is a terrible story, but Paul Simon, in an interview, swears that
it's true.  Someone asked him about his songs.  He said he was in a restaurant
down south, stopped in for a sandwich, long time ago.  Asked for a chicken and
egg sandwich.  The waitress called back the request to the cook, "One mother
and child reunion."

     And that's where he got the title....
