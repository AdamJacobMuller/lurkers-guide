     Other stupid question moment.  Back in the 50s, there was an SF series
called "Planet Patrol."  No, not "Space Patrol" (though that was what it was
called in England), "Planet Patrol."  Aired in New York on WPIX.  We're
talking here puppets, okay?  Cool martians and tube cars and rockets and space
stations and stuff.  Used to watch the show all the time when I was a kid, and
am looking for copies of the episodes.  (It was made in B&amp;W.)  For *years*,
nobody even believed it existed; it isn't in ANY book that I'm aware of.
Finally, about 2 years ago, I got my hands on one copy of one episode from a
contact, which wasn't much, but was enough to convince everyone from holding
that planned sanity hearing.  It DOES (or did) exist.  So once every year or
two, I put out the word...if anyone here has copies of this show, or knows
where same can be gotten, I'd *very* much appreciate hearing about it.

                                                                jms
