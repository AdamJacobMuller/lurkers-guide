     "Memo to myself: don't ever compare an episode of B5 to an episode of
Star Trek without first researching the entirety of written fiction for non-
Trek precedents."

     That's a snotty response that has nothing to do with the issue that I
gigged you on.  You can compare anything to anything, I really don't care.
All that I have asked you to do is be aware of your language when you accuse
someone of stealing something?  Why is that so difficult for you to grasp?

     You keep trying to distort my point into something that it's not, and I
have no intention of letting you get away with it.  You said we did a remake
of an ST episode.  You didn't discuss the issues, you said it was a remake.
You implied the story was lifted from ST.  That is what you said.  I'm sorry
if it's now inconvenient for you, or that you got your nose caught in the
doorjam, but words mean what they mean, not what you want them to mean.

     And I find it very telling that when confronted, you announced that your
only options were to slink off or throw this in my face.  Odd that you
wouldn'd consider something like, "Sorry, it wasn't my intention to indicate
that Larry had stolen the idea.  I regret if that was implied."

     Guess that never even occured to you, did it?

     You can dance around re-interpretations all you want, Halliwell, but your
comment was rude, and pejorative, and an insult to Larry, and by association
to me.  And it's got nothing to do with comparisons or the entirety of written
fiction.  And that's clear to every person here but you.  You're evading and
backing and filling.

     You get very cavalier here about other people, about the work that others
do, their talents or lack thereof...you're always the first in line to
criticize somebody...but you don't much like it when it's you, do you?  Why
should I treat you with any more respect than you treat others?  Now, on
another day, maybe I'd just turn the other cheek, which  I do a *lot* around
here, and let it go.  But today, now, here, I don't much feel like it.  Maybe
I've heard this line once too often from people, and you're just the latest
one to get in my face with it.  Either way, maybe you'll learn something about
running one's mouth, and that words have meaning, and if you accuse somebody
of remaking somebody else's idea, you'd damned well better be prepared to back
it up, or back off and apologize.

     Or is even that modicum of civilized behavior completely beyond your
comprehension?

     We'll know in your next post whether you intend to act like a man, or a
weasel.  It's your call.
