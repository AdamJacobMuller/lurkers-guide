     In at least some of those cases, Kiwi, it's not writer's laziness; you're
not paying attention.  Delenn knew the ship was coming in at the top of the
episode; when she realized that the gun ports were open, she went immediately
to Sinclair.  Story logic.  Also story logic for the appearance of Sinclair
and Garibaldi at the cargo bay; they didn't just "wander in," they determined
what had happened, and went there knowing that there was a Minbari transport
about to head out.
