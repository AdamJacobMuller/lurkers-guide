     Thank you, thank you, *thank you* for giving me the name of the pinhead
who's been spreading that information around.  I've been trying to backtrack
it for a few weeks now.  It's been really infuriating because it simply ain't
true.

     Oh, good, this means tomorrow I get to call somebody up and yell at him.


     I *enjoy* that.  There's nothing more wonderful in all the universe that
a justified, righteous mad.  I get all tingly just thinking about it.

                                                                   jms
