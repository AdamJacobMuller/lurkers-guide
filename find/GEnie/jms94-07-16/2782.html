     From cradle to grave, the Minbari are taught that there is no greater
goal, no nobler thing than to serve.  They are raised to be totally self-
sacrificing.  The only exception is when someone in the religious caste
believes he or she has received a calling, which if sincerely felt cannot be
contravened (since usually this too involves serving).  So for a Minbari
telepath, this is their means by which they may serve, and they are given
great respect.  It never even occurs to them to do otherwise.

     Lately, there has been a bit of a change brewing; "a self-involvement
above the needs of others" (as someone notes in "Voice") that has begun
creeping into the Minbari race.  And they're not happy about it.
