     Yeah, the audio thing with Talia is something I thought of during the
final audio mix.  We wanted to convey somehow her trying to get through and
initially it was just distortion.  Then I figured, wait a second, she is going
to be thinking what she's going to say before she says it, why not pre-lap the
dialogue?  Unfortunately, for some damned reason, the high-tech studio wasn't
set up to do that effect, so we took Talia's dialogue, digitized it, laid it
in on a second side track, and played the one over the other, one preceding
the other by I think about 20 frames or so.  The key was to make the *second*
voicing the one synched to her lips, not the first one.  Worked out pretty
cool.
