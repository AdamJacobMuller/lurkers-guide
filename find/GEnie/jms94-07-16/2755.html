     San Diego Comic Con *Flash*.....I've been asked to do two major B5
presentations (well, major in that I'll be there...which is kinda major, I
guess...okay, maybe a lieutenant...second lieutenant...actually, it's not a
big thing....) at the convention: one is still slated for that Friday from 2-4
p.m., and they've added a second presentation from 11-1 Saturday.  (If you saw
the Chicago presentation, there isn't much need to hustle to see the one on
Friday; but you may want to be there for the Saturday one, which will be in a
larger room.)

     Possible that Bill Mumy will be there; don't know (doubt it) if Harlan
will be able to show up in time; John Iacovelli (art/production designer
extraordinaire) will try to show up for one of these.

                                                               jms
