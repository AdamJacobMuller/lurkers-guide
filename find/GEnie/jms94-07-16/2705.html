     The first batch of mugs are from (you'll pardon the expression) Creation.

     Currently about 2/3rds finished writing a second-season ep called
"Revelations," and though I've written and commissioned others already, this
one's sizing up to be a major ass-kicker from a story perspective.
Definitely the flip-side of "Chrysalis."  Some really, really nice stuff.

     The hardest part is always writing Kosh, because you have to be very
careful how much you use him, and what he says.  Too much and he loses his
sense of mystery, and you don't want him spouting fortune-cookie  type
aphorisms.  He has a very deliberate way of speaking in which  everything,
every smallest nuance and inflection means something, but sometimes not what
it appears to mean, or comes at it from a very different angle than normal
conversation.  So I go as minimalist as possible, to get the meaning down to
the smallest number of words possible.  And in one scene, one of only two he
appears in, I got him down to *one word*, and that one word -- and it's a
totally inoffensive, neutral word on its own terms -- should scare the hell
out of *everybody*.

     Ah loves this show....
