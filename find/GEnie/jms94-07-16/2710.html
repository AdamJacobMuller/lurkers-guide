     Yes, a businessman can insist on having his own telepath present, or can
ask not to be scanned during negotiations...though it is a sign that one has
something to hide, and might screw the deal.  Sinclair could have asked for a
telepath on his side, but 1) that wasn't the issue, it was allowing NO
telepath to have that access, and 2) would've requird a Psi Corps military
liaison-type telepath, and none were available on station.
