     Yeah...I love Londo's song, that whole scene.  The director wanted to cut
Ivanova's coda after her mantra, but I really felt we needed it, and it played
perfectly with her Russian character, which tends to have this unusual
relationship with higher forces (he said vaguely).  I love character based
humor, because it's very powerful once you know the characters, and it can
really blind-side you if done right.  Ivanova's reaction in the core area was
about as real as would probably happen, but it's funny to hear her *say* it.

                                                                jms
