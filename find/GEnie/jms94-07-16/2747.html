     That is one of the things we hope to do with the B5 fan liaison office,
when and if we can get it going; to help defray expenses, we think we can
market a few things, including scripts of aired shows, with the proviso that
the original writer gets a royalty off the scripts, and/or can opt not to have
their script sold if they so desire.

                                                               jms
