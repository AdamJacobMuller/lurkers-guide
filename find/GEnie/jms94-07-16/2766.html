     Pat: thanks.  Unfortunately, I really can't take the risk that everyone
has seen all prior episodes; the information needed for episode B to be clear
has to be included, even if it's a restatement of something we saw in a prior
episode.  Otherwise, I don't think we're really playing fair with the
audience, and people will start tuning out.
