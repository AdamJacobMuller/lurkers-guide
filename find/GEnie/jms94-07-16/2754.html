     Insofar as I know, the designs entered in on the cruisers hasn't been
modified at all, so I can't account for any perceived differences.  And I
believe that the Minbari flyer used was the same model as Deathwalker used,
though without checking the tapes I can't be 100% sure.  It's a fairly
standard flyer.
