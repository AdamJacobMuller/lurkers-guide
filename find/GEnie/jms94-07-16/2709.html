     Yeah, just about all of our monitor stuff in scenes is done live on the
stage, rather than in post; gives it a nice sense of reality, I think.

     Re: serpentine medium...about 75% of the reason I picked that font was
because it looked cool, and 25% because I liked the name and the image it
brings to mind.

     Re: telepathy...yes, it's bordered and proscribed by physical
limitations, in many ways; the closer you are, the better you can do.   Even
Bester, in "Mind War," noted that he could shut Ironheart down, "but we have
to be on a line-of-sight to do it."  They couldn't just broadcast it into the
ether, he had to be *there* in front of them.

     The whole telepathy issue is an interesting one in the universe of B5.
There have always been attempts to prove the existence of telepathy, but in
general the findings have been inconclusive.  But about 125 years or so ago in
B5's timeline (2100-2110 and thereabouts) the findings began suddenly to tilt,
and full-blown telepaths began to be discovered.  There were some abortive and
confused attempts to legislate around this, most of which failed or were
overturned in various courts of law.  About 2150 or so, the government
agencies that regulated and oversaw telepaths were rolled over into the newly
established Psi Corps, which became a clearing house for locating,
controlling, and licensing telepaths for commercial, some very restricted
legal, and military purposes.

                                                                 jms
