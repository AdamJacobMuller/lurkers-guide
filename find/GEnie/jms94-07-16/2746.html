     One of the things we're thinking of doing, once and if we can get this B5
fan liaison office going, is to sell scripts from the show.  But unlike any
other script house (and a certain other show that sells its scripts), the
writers of the scripts sold will get a royalty off the sale of their scripts;
or, if they don't want them sold, we won't do so.   And it won't be exclusive
in any event.

                                                               jms
