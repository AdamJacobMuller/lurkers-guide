     We're re-doing *all* of our computer displays for next year, using some
nifty graphic designs.  Part of the problem is that the boys at Foundation
were doing the displays, and they were swamped doing our main CGI, so that
kinda fell by the wayside.  This year we've got someone who does ONLY our
computer screens with us in-house.

     Glad you liked the series font, btw; I picked it out me own self.   It's
Serpentine Medium, for anyone interested.
