     Actually, Anne, I don't agree...I'd say that the majority of comments
come with constructive observations.  You get unvarnished "it's perfect,
change nothing," about as often as "it sucks, change everything."  Those are
rare individuals.  Mostly you get something in between.

                                                                   jms
