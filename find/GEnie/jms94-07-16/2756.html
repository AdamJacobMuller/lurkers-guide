     I'll tell you a true thing, and I'm not saying this to get any kind of
reassurance or pats, this is the god's honest truth...I never  feel that way.
If one of the cast shows up, if one of our other folks shows up, that's a big
deal, from my perspective.  Me is just me, and I'm forever *astonished* when
people actually show up.  I'm constantly sure that I'm going to go to the room
and find that no one is there.  I'm told by people that I'm supposed to be
some kind of "celebrity," whatever the hell THAT means this week...but I've
never transitioned into accepting that notion.
