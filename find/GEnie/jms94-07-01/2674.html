     I believe the episode title in "Jayce" was "Final Ride at Journey's End."
Someone wants revenge, sets things in motion, realizes to his horror that
innocents will be killed, and sacrifices his own life to stop his own actions.

     What would Elfquest have been like?  Like the books.  I figure my job in
adapting something is to stay as close as possible to the original source, and
not mess with it.

                                                                  jms
