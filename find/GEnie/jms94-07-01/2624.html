     Booj'...thanks.

     Re: audio...for the *most* part, there won't be a difference in the
reruns, though there will be a marked difference in the video release of
episodes, when that happens.

     What happened was this: we went into this using the full dynamic range of
available audio.  Right to the edge of the red line.  Just one problem...many
of the stations, and the uplink facility, use audio limiters, which crunches
down the audio if it goes too far.  It took us a while to find out that this
was the source of the problem, and we mixed the last few episodes coming in
just a few decibels under the point where the automatic clamping kicked in.
We'll keep to this in future.  Video releases won't have this problem.

     What can I say...I'm a rock'n'roll kinda guy...I like stuff *loud*.

     CGI is generally much faster than models.  I have in my hands the major
CGI sequences from our first episode of year two, and we haven't even started
*shooting* yet.

                                                                  jms
