     RE: the PPGs...sorry, Kiwi, I don't agree with you.  We *have* shown burn
marks on clothing...in fact you'll get a good look at it in several upcoming
episodes.  Those who've seen "Quality of Mercy" can vouch for that one alone.
And they do leave *brief* trails, but remember they are moving very fast,
almost too fast for the eye to see.  These aren't rays, like phasers, they're
bursts of superheated plasma.
