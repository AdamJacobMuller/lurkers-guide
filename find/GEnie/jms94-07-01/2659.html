     Just as the episodes are designed to be watched in full, in part, only a
few, in or out of order (for the most part), similarly the web (comic, books,
show) will be consistent but not overlapping in any way that requires *anyone*
to read or watch all of them to follow anything.  I would consider this
*vastly* unfair.  They should be *consistent* with one another, that's all.
If a piece of information comes out in the comic, and later that becomes
useful, it must and will be referenced in dialogue so that it's *totally*
clear to anyone watching.

                                                                jms
