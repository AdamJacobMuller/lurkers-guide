     PS...for those in the LA area, and who enjoyed the excerpts of Norman
Corwin's work...two of his radio dramas will be performed at the Hollywood
Roosevelt Hotel, in their theater, on July 13th at 1 or 1:30.  Norman will be
directing the performance (I think lunch is included).  Expect some
celebrities in the cast.  The two radio dramas are "The Strange Affliction"
and "My Client Curly."

                                                                     jms
