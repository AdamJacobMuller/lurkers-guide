     I think the "Requiem" piece is a bit shorter on my CD, only in that it
doesn't include the follow-up on the Minbari cruiser.  As for the  CD-ROM,
insofar as I know it's still slated for late Fall.  I'm having a meeting with
the boys from Compton New Media either later this week or first part of next
week, and hope to have more info at that time.

                                                                   jms
