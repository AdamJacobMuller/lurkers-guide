      Well, actually, I'm not really ashamed of any of it...there was some
 good work done in all of those shows...it's just when I look back at them,
 it's like looking back at anything you did; your brain goes into vapor
 lock.  You're tooling along the B5 freeway, minding your own business, and
 somebody suddenly tosses a Jayce into the middle of the road, and your
 brain trips over it for a moment.

      About six, seven months ago, I dragged out some of the old animated
 stuff, and while some of it has worn, a lot of it still plays pretty
 well.  Out of dozens of episodes, I think there are only 3 or so that I'd
 like to eliminate from the known universe.  (One of them is the CBS
 Storybreak I wrote, adapting "The Shy Stegosaurus of Cricket Creek," which
 I finally got to see after 5 years, much to my regret.)

      For anyone who cares:

      HE-MAN AND THE MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE - a dozen or more episodes
      SHE-RA, PRINCESS OF POWER - ditto
      JAYCE AND THE WHEELED WARRIORS - ditto
      THE REAL GHOSTBUSTERS - close to 20 episodes

      I think that's all of them.  Developed ELFQUEST for CBS, but it
 never got near the air, and one syndicated show that got so perverted by
 the producers, in a bad way, that I took my name off the series.

                                                               jms
