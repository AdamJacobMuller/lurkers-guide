     Okay, as I understand it, given a call today from the mysterious  Nancy
with SDCC, my main panel/episode showing will be Friday, from 2-4 p.m.  I'd
originally figured that there should be two panels, one a straightforward
panel, the other mainly a showing, but they got jammed into one.  Initially
they'd slated it for 3 hours, 2-5, but I can't see subjecting *anyone* to
three hours in a chair.

                                                                  jms
