     Kiwi...you're full of it.  This has got nothing to do with  expressing
negative opinions.  That's a dodge.  There's been plenty of negative opinion
expressed here and elsewhere, along with all the positive stuff, and I haven't
said a word about it.  And frankly I'm getting tired of people who mouth off
about something in an offensive way, then saying when they get called on it
that I'm trying to suppress  negative opinion.

     And I'm not talking about comparisons here.  I'm addressing what you
*specifically* wrote, that this was "little more than a remake of Drumhead."
You didn't say that it explored the same themes, which  would've been fine,
you didn't say that it stayed in the same areas as cop shows, which also
would've been fine...you not only said that it was a remake, you then listed a
point-by-point comparison.

     You're the one dancing around semantics here.  I'm not tired of or
discouraging comparisons, I'm tired of people who don't know what the hell
they're talking about saying that we're ripped off/remade/borrowed a Star Trek
story.  Which is what you said.  It's right there in the message.  It's got
nothing to do with negative opinions, and everything to do with a false
accusation on your part.

     You don't like it?  Fine.  But I have a tendency to prefer the truth,
stated harshly, to a falsehood stated casually.

                                                              jms
