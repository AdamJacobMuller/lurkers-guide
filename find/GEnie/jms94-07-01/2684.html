     Boy, the most obscure reference in the bunch...yeah, I slipped some spoo
in there once.  A couple of real cute (as in wanna drop a truck on them cute)
elf-types offer Skeletor a bowl of Spoo.  His reply: (in a mincing tone to
start) "No, I don't want any SPOOOOOOO.  I *hate* Spoo. (beat)  And I don't
even know what Spoo IS."

                                                                 jms
