     CAll the Writers Guild, and find out how much a copy of their Journal
costs.  It lists the "contact person" for each show.  If that show isn't
listed, pick the story editor.  A letter is your way in, but do NOT include a
synopsis.  State that the script is finished, that you would like to submit it
(if not through an agent, then using a release form of their choice) for their
perusal.  After that, it's up to them.
