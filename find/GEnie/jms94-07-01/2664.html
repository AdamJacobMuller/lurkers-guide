     It's going to be both.

     One primary area will deal with the fictional world of B5.  It will have
backgrounds on all of our characters, plus details about all of the major
alliances (Narns, Minbari, others).  You'll see their homeworlds, learn their
culture, see some of their language, that sort of thing.   There will be a
fairly extensive chronology of events between the present and the time of the
series, detailing when we first encountered the Centauri, the Dilgar invasion,
and other stuff.

     It should be a fairly extensive encyclopedia of the B5 universe.

     The other component will deal with the production.  I very much want to
de-mystify how TV is made.  So there will be extensive sections on that area,
including one section where you can follow a sequence from script to wardrobe,
storyboard, sets, to shooting, to the point of having several dailies from
that finished sequence which you can then edit into any order you want,
emphasizing people of your choice, close-ups or masters, with the final
addition of a piece of music so you can then score the finished product.

     It should be very cool.

                                                                jms
