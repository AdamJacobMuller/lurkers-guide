     Goodman...*not* to take sides in this, but just to clarify a
misperception on your part...something need not bring in a profit in order to
violate copyright.  The act of publishing something, using copyrighted
characters, is infringement pure and simple.  And many of the studios now
*are* going after fanzines, for the simple reason that if they don't, you run
the risk of *losing* your copyright by allowing some things to enter the
public domain.

     For instance, PTEN recently had to go after a computer company for buying
ads using B5 photos without copyright attribution on the photo; those photos
now run the danger of entering public domain.  They had to take sharp legal
action.  (This happened with some Star Wars stuff, by the way, and some Star
Trek early stuff.)  The issue is *not* as you represent it.
