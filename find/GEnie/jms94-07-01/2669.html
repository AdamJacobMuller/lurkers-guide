     No, they are not.

     Any script broker selling copies of B5 scripts is doing so without
permission.  They are engaging in copyright infringement.  The contents of the
scripts belong to PTEN, but the physical copies belong to the writers, who get
nothing out of this.  It ruins, for instance, Christy's chance to make a few
dollars selling what is hers, if her script gets on the open market.

                                                                    jms
