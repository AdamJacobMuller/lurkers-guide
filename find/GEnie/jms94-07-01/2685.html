     Okay, real simple question.  Long discourses and discussions will only
confuse me and, finally, scare the hell out of me.

     Should I buy the Dell Dimension XPS P90 now, or wait for the 604 chip to
come out with the Power PCs in the fall?

                                                                 jms
