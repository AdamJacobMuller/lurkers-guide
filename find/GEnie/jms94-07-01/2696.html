     BTW...about the time we were delivering "Eyes," somebody on one of the
nets was going on and on about how "B5 continuity *stinks*...I'll bet we NEVER
hear about Deathwalker again, or the strike, or the Vorlons killing
Deathwalker, or Raghesh 3...."

     And seeing what was at that moment on my TV, I wanted to reach through
the computer monitor, roll up my forefinger, and *plink* that person right
upside the nose.

     Unfortunately, I have not yet found a modem program that supports this
feature.

     But Ron is promising me something by the Fall....
