     There are plans for some kind of B5 fan group, run out of Babylonian
Productions, to coordinate stuff and do a very small amount of limited selling
(just enough to keep us from getting deep into debt on the thing, since it'll
cost us about $75,000 per year to run it).  This will also be a central
clearing house for convention organizers.  More on this as we nail it down.

                                                                jms
