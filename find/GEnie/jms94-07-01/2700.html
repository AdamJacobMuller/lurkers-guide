     Thanks; yeah, it's good to know that we don't seem to have, or need
people jumping hoops to try and make things work or make sense.  It's a pretty
good conversation (despite ye olde author's occasional crankiness).  If
anything, I'm harder on the episodes than anyone else, since I know all the
elements that might have been stronger or different, and I always, *always*
want to go back one more time and tweak something, adjust something.  And for
what it's worth...yeah, the pilot wasn't all it should've been.  But we've
moved on, and I think so far the season has been very good.  Win, lose or
draw, I think we've made a mark.

                                                               jms
