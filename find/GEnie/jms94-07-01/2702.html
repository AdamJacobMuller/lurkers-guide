     The other thing about "Eyes," btw, is that it's not something dumped in
outta nowhere to make a conflict; it's the direct payoff of events that take
place throughout the season where Sinclair breaks or bends the rules.  Lots of
people on the various nets said, "Yeah, there he goes, breaking the rules in
the strike, but is this every gonna pay off?  No, probably not."  If we're
consistent with reality, and with our story, and Sinclair's broken some rules,
and pissed off some people back home, then it is *inevitable* that this will
eventually come home to roost in the form of an investigation.

                                                                   jms
