     At one time we were working out what the time-reference would be on B5.
One of the early things we talked about were cycles, but in fairly short order
I decided against it because it didn't seem to mean much.   But this was,
sadly, after "Grail" had been produced, and we couldn't dub over the cycle
references with anything else, so it stayed.  It won't be appearing anywhere
else henceforth.  One of our few continuity glitches.
