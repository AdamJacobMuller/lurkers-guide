     To the best of my knowledge, reruns will still continue after we've
finished with new episodes for this season, and will be interspersed in second
season, so there will be plenty of chances to catch up.

     BTW, for those who saw the promo for "Eyes" at the end of "Grail," I have
*no* idea what it has to do with the episode.  Sometimes they "enhance" the
story to make it promote-able...but I think this time they "enhanced" it right
into a parallel dimension....

                                                                 jms
