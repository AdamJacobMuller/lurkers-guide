     PPG = Phased Plasma Gun.  "Domo Arigato" is Japanese.  Grey reached into
Ben Zayn's head and, for lack of a better term, pushed his "pain button," the
same way you can stimulate someone's memory or physical sensations with an
electrode or chemicals.  It was only a second, and he would've shrugged it off
quickly, had Sinclair not been there to follow up.
