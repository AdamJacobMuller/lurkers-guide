     Well, it was certainly based on the "classic" UFO alien design, yes.
(And if there's a saucer parked in front of the B5 offices tomorrow, I'm not
going in.)

     Both Christy Marx and Kathryn can both be *briefly* seen in the pilot
movie as BG in the casino...and in the main titles, Kathryn's back is to the
camera in the wide downshot, though you really can't make it out well in that
one.  Also in the montage in the pilot movie, seated at the bar under
narration, the fellow with the beard, is art director John Iacovelli.]

                                                                 jms
