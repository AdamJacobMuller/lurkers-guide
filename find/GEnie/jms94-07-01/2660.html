     That's the other thing I forgot: yes, there will be cards, from Cardz.
(Or so I'm told; the deal was made, but I haven't heard much from them
lately.)

     Cyberdad: if it weren't for the fact that I kinda want some of this stuff
myself, I'd probably work against *any* merchandising as much as I could.
Merchandising can begin to drive a show, and suddenly you find yourself
introducing items just so you can merchandise them, changing the costumes
every couple of seasons to keep that licensor going...as a fan myself, I hate
that, and won't do it now that I'm in this position.

     I'm not a salesman, I'm a writer.  If we can do something that adds to
the story, or that would look real neat on my wall, terrific.  But the day
that we do Babylon 5 Underoos, as I said at ChicagoCon, somebody just shoot
me.  (And you'd be amazed at how *quickly* someone volunteered....)
