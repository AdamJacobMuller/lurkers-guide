     I don't generally have lucid dreams, but there is something very weird
about 95% of all my dreams.

     (And please, don't noboby cite Lovecraft to me, honest to Irving, this is
how they are.)

     Nearly all of my dreams take place in the same place...a sort of dream
city that has gradually grown over the years somewhere in my head.   It's just
what that implies: a city.  I know the geography of the place pretty well,
though there are occasionally little places I stumble upon that I hadn't
noticed before.

     I know where the theaters are, where the stores are, and where the main
shopping center is.  There's a bus route that takes you up out of the main
part of the city to a little junior college on the fringe of the suburbs.  You
take the #2 bus, which goes north about five miles, then hooks left.   You get
off at the main road, and walk south about three  blocks and you're there.  On
the return trip, you get off about half a block from a magazine/bookshop.  I
know the guy who runs it by face, but haven't yet asked his name.  I probably
will eventually.  In the front of the store are the general magazines and
paperbacks; in wood bins a little further in are comics and older magazines.
The window faces south, and covers most of the storefront.

     I'm also a writer here in this "city" as well.  I have a two story house.
The second level merges with the hillside a bit, so you can walk out onto
grass, and a stone flagstone walk.  My office is on the second floor.  For the
last year there's been some renovations in progress, and a bunch of the floor
on the second floor has been torn up.

     It's the same locale in nearly every single dream.  It's *that* specific.
There's no real plot, no major danger.  I work there, go to see a movie
sometimes, do some shopping, threads even cross dreams and recur later on.
(There was a big flap recently because the city was going to tear down the old
theater at the corner near the magazine shop, but we managed to postpone the
development.)

     It is a coherent, consistent city in which 95% of my dreams take place.
I see the same people, places, things.  Some people get very creeped out when
I tell them this.  To me, it's just the other place I go when I'm asleep.

                                                               jms
