     After "Grail," we had a discussion with Chris about funny music.  We do
not anticipate further discussions.  (In a full season of music for B5, this
is the only discussion we've had of a critical nature, which is extraordinary
for any series; he's done a lot of wonderful work for us.
 In the two-parter, btw, he went absolutely full-out and gave us some of the
best scoring of the season...gorgeous stuff, second only to either "Sky" or
"Chrysalis.")

     Mike: re: being "more realistic" in representing alien life...you show it
to me, and I'll do it.  For now, we don't know *what* is "realistic."  Maybe
crop circles are a wonderful forgery, abductions a psychological aberration,
and saucers mass hysteria.  And maybe they're not.  As someone noted, the
universe is not only stranger than we know, it is stranger than we *can* know.
