     Okay, Ms. Smartypants, then what does "cycles" MEAN?  If it means cycles
of the station, it cycles once every minute to maintain 1g.  So 300 cycles is
only 300 minutes.

     Your serve.

     BTW...it comes to my attention that Mark Altman was going on today at a
Creation Convention in Glendale CA about how O'Hare was replaced because of
negative comments made about him here on GEnie.

     Okay...now...you're a cute bunch, especially in the aggregate, and I like
you a lot, but frankly all of us here don't even amount to s (a)
squiggle...even *one percent* of a squiggle...on the Neilsen charts.

     Though I respect Mark Altman, that was a boneheaded mistake on his part.
Simply ain't true.  And if he's *going* to say stuff like that, you'd think
that maybe he'd call me first to verify this stuff before launching it out
there.

                                                        jms
