     Well, in the interim a friend who's running a show has asked me to come
in and help out for a little while (wrote a 21 page outline overnight the day
after I said yes to help meet the production crunch), and I've started my
third novel, which is actually good timing.  For me, the first 100-200 pages
of a novel are the hardest; after that, it's a lot easier.   My hope is to
have some or all of that part done by the time we really get going seriously
on B5 the series, so that I can continue at a reduced speed from that point on
until the book is finished.  (I figure it'll take about a year, a year and a
half to write the book, which I expect will be about 1,200 to 1,500 pages in
length.)  If I were to wait until B5 began in earnest to start writing the
novel, it'd never get past the first few chapters because of the other
pressures.  This is my one window of opportunity to start the thing.

     So that's the main work now: B5 post, the new show, the novel, doing my
BBSing...oh, yeah, and I've started a few short stories, and obviously will
continue to do interviews and other promotional work for B5, as well as
developing the long-term 10-hour project I mentioned a while before, which I
should hear more about in the next few weeks.  I've been asked to write a
network pilot, which is kind of interesting, and may tackle that  as well,
just to see if I can do it.

     Other than that, it's real slow right now.

                                                                 jms
