     Nope.  Nothing changes.

     Because Delenn was *always* going to end up female eventually, one way or
another.  Start male, end up female.  Using the same performer with some
adjustments to the prosthetics after the change.

     Which is why I haven't commented upon the gender-change stuff being said
here.  Some of you guessed right.  So instead of waiting a few months and
making the change mid-season, we start off with Delenn female.  No changes to
the overall arc.

                                                               jms
