     Since I have access to you computer whizs (whizes? whizzes? whizi?), let
me pose a question.

     For my sound card, I have the Media Visions Thunderboard for Windows.
Now, it works fine on such DOS programs as "Carmen San Diego"  (though a
couple it seems to have a problem with).  But when I try to use it in Windows
(for which after all it was intended), nothing happens.  It hums for a second,
but that's all.  For instance, when I run After Dark, it clicks for a second,
but nothing comes out.

     I moved the system.ini interrupt for the driver to 2 from 9, but that
doesn't seem to work either.  I installed the driver, but that doesn't work.
I tried to run a sound program off a floppy (the pro demo that comes with the
card) and the first time, it worked.  The second time, I got two error
messages; the first said "selected MIDI out port is not available or is in use
by another application."  The MIDI in port also got the same message.  When I
then used the MIDI setup on the floppy, it said "General protection fault in
module timemidi.dll."  And the thing crashed.

     I went through system.ini and the only thing I could find that looked
like a midi port control was MIDI=msadlib.drv, which I deleted, and tried
again.  Same result.

     Any suggestions?
