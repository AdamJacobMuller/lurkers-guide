     To some degree, yeah, I can't say a *lot* about this, but in general,
yes, these are all areas that we plan on exploring.  The economics of trade,
the effects of the war, all of this.  Again, what we're striving for in B5 is
to always ask the next question.  Like, "Who pays for B5?"  That's a question
you don't usually run into in SF show...who foots the bill for all these
starships running around the galaxy?  With 4 other Babylon stations decimated
(three before becoming operational, one after), the Earth Alliance skimped on
the current version, rather like the Shuttle.   They want to see if it will
last before sinking vast amounts of money into it.  Which is why, in one hour-
script finished already, there's a reference made to giving some visiting
Centauri businessmen the Grand Tour in hopes of getting some investment from
them in B5 to counter the costs absorbed by the EA.

     Economics and the like are things you can happily ignore if your show has
nothing to do with the real world.
