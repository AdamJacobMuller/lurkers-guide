     Dolphins are another area that I haven't gone into in any great degree
since the odds of any of them showing up at B5 are minimal, for production
reasons.  Dolphins make for difficult actors, and their agents are even worse.

     The homeless question brings me to a difficult point in the discussion _
generalities are okay to discuss, Jonathan, but the more specific the
questions get about plot points of the series, the less I can say.  The five-
year arc is triple-encrypted in my computer for a *reason*.  And, as much as
it pains me, I know that printups of this category go to a certain other
studio...and would rather not give too many specifics for obvious reaons.  I'd
like us to do them first.  Alas, we're not having this conversation in a
vacuum.
