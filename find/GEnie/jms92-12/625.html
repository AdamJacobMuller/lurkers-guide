     Gary...sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.  Twelve stars were all that
could fit in the available space.

     BUT...you're right in general, however.  There were very few who survived
the Line, not as few as 12, but less than 100.  So believe me, it IS a big
deal.  (Which is also why a lot of folks back home are looking askance at
Sinclair...how could he survive, unconscious, for 24 hours in a ship floating
through a war zone without being blown out of the sky?)
