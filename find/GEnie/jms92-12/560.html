     I guess the one way in which the feedback has been the most useful has
been in asking questions that I hadn't thought of.  When you put a show like
this together, you try to second-guess problems or questions down the road.
What's been fun here is that I've often been blind-sided by questions that I'd
never considered.  I then have to find an answer to those questions, which
then sticks.  There have been questions of sound in space, kinds of weapons
technologies, that sort of thing.  One person asked about the jump-gates, and
how they got there, which led me to formulate the idea that big ships
(cruisers) are big and powerful enough to form their own entry point into
hyperspace, while smaller ships have to rely on jump-points...so it's the job
of some of the bigger ships to leave jump-points behind them like bread
crumbs, enabling us to move further out into space.

     In other words...I come up with pertinent information by being asked a
lot of impertinent questions.  Which is as it should be.

                                                                 jms
