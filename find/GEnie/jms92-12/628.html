     Curiously, unions and the inner running of the station is something that
Harlan wants to get into once the series is up and running, so I'll leave that
to him.

     Re: the other Psi questions...I'll have to pull back because that touches
on some areas that I want to develop later.  Suffice to say that the questions
you raise will be answered.  (And no, they're not part of the military...at
least, not officially....)

                                                                  jms
