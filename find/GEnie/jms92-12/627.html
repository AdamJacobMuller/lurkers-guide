     No, physical contact is not required.  Lyta hasn't tried to read
Sinclair's mind-block because he doesn't know it's there...yet.  Yes, psi
ability is genetic, and appears in other races.  There are non-Psi Corps
members who have the ability, and are not licensed and bonded, and the PC
would very much like to do something about that.

     Psi rating is based on strength of ability.  The general ranking is P1
through P10.  Psi Cops _ sent to engage and take out rogue telepaths _ are
P12s.  They don't talk much.  They don't have to.
