     The B5 "starter kit," to use that phrase, consists really of two GIF
files in the library and some of the files compiled by Posner and the brief
release that I put in some time ago.  That should give a fairly good
background on the show.  Then you can dive in on the rest.

     Is it my imagination, or have we added a LOT of new folks in the last few
weeks?  If so, I'm curious to know what brought y'all here.

                                                               jms
