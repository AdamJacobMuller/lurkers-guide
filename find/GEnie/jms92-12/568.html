     The last five years, eh?      

     oboy....

     Let's see...that's 30 columns plus maybe 7-10 major articles for Writer's
Digest...okay...1987 would include POWER, which means about 12 episodes on
that (counting stories, and it *may* be higher than that, I'm doing this from
memory)...12 total Twilight Zone episodes...4 or 5 episodes of Jake and the
Fatman (plus 1 co-written 2-hour MOW)...the Jekyll and Hyde adaptation for
Showtime's Nightmare Classics show (which earned Ace and Writers Guild
nominations for writing)...4 or 5 episodes of the Ghostbusters animated
series, plus the musical prime-time special... seven episodes of Murder, She
Wrote...an episode of CBS Storybreak ("The Shy Stegosaurus of Cricket Creek,"
adaptation, which to this day I've never seen)....

     I think that's *most* of the produced stuff, though I'm pretty sure I'm
missing a few items (oh, yeah...and Babylon 5, natch).

     On the unproduced side, we've got the 4-hour V miniseries, a feature film
written for Ivan Reitman, another feature written for London Films, another 4
or 5 unproduced Jake and Murder episodes, another Nightmare Classics
adaptation for Showtime, several unproduced pilots (live action and animation)
for various studios...6 scripts, 4 outlines and 10 premises written to put
together an anthology series which didn't fly...five or six spec feature
screenplays, and some other stuff, again this is all off the top of my head.

     Then there have been articles in the late lamented L.A. Herald Examiner,
the L.A. Times, cover stories for the L.A. Reader, articles appearing in Video
Review and Penthouse...oh, yeah, and a dozen or more articles about Night
Gallery appearing in Twilight Zone Magazine ("A Viewer's Guide to Rod
Serling's Night Gallery") co-written with my spousal overunit...short stories
in Amazing Stories, Shadows 6, Midnight Graffiti, Pulphouse....

     Then there have been the two novels, Demon Night and Othersyde, both from
Dutton, and the Twilight Zone anthology for which I adapted my TV scripts into
short stories....oh!  And comic books!  How could I forget that?  One issue of
the Star Trek book, "Worldsinger," an issue of Teen Titans Spotlight ("Face to
Face to Face to Face," pitting Cyborg against Two Face), and an issue of the
Twilight Zone comic.  Jeez, I almost forgot that stuff.

     And for almost all of those 5 years I was host of the weekly radio talk
show, Hour 25 (first alone, then with a cohost, then with a cohost and
alternating weeks the last year or two), 2 hours of talk with SF writers,
actors and directors, among others.  Somewhere in there, along with the WGA
and Ace nominations, I picked up nominations for the Bram Stoker Award for
Demon Night, and for a Gemini Award (the Canadian equivilent of an Emmy)
nomination for an episode of Power.

     That's a partial list of the last 5 years.  I've missed a lot, but that's
probably the major stuff, in any event.  (Under the category of "unproduced,"
I also adapted Elfquest to a series for CBS, along with a co-writer, but can't
just now remember if that was 87 or 86.)  If anything else comes to mind, I'll
drop it in later.

     But that's really as specific as I can be without dragging out boxes and
other stuff...I hardly remember titles anymore, or which month which articles
appeared where.  Eventually I'm going to have to get someone in here to
straighten it all out and put it all in order.  Because there's literally
stuff that I've done that I've *completely* forgotten about; I'll be rummaging
through tapes or boxes of manuscripts and come across something I'd utterly
forgotten about.  Senility, I suppose....
