     The basic logo is my design.  We'd gone throug none of which were quite
right, and finally I wrote a memo to Ron Thornton about what I thought would
be correct.  I described the word Babylon in silver appearing backlit by a red
laser shooting across frame, with the 5 in black behind it.  Big metallic
silver letters, and a much darker, jet-black metallic 5.  "The main thing," I
said in the memo, "is that it should look way cool on a leather jacket."  Ron
then executed the logo as described, it came out right, and it *does* look
swell on a jacket.
