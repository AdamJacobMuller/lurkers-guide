     Will: I don't think I'm getting through.  Perhaps I wasn't clear.
(Which is the likely prospect.)

     It's not a case of putting CGI efx on film via paintbox or that sort of
thing.  In cases of full-CGI only in a shot, the computer generates  each
frame of the sequence, which is then transferred direct into a laserdisk
recorder for maximum video quality.  This is then transferred  to videotape.
It never touches film.

     In the case of mixing CGI with live action, the scene in question is
digitized, transferred into the computer, and mixed there with the CGI, then
sent back into the laser disk recorder.  Again, it never touches film.  And we
deliver the final product on videotape, not film.

     If we end up distributing the film theatrically overseas, at THAT point
it will all be transferred to film, and the quality, I understand, will be
terrific.
