     Haven't written any SF novels.  When I work in prose, I tend to favor
dark fantasy.  Which is the same genre as the new novel I'm now working on.  I
just have a preference for contemporary dark fantasy in my reading _ Jonathan
Carroll, and many of the South American writers of "magic realism" _ so
that's what I tend to write, in prose.

     Haven't yet seen any of the promos on 13, but I've heard from others who
have seen them.  (Including the preceding note from Prof Mark.) I'm looking
for this stuff as eagerly as everybody else.

                                                                 jms
