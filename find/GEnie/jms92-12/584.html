     Just as with the early days of ocean travel, you would generally have
three levels of travel: first class, one just below, and down deep below
decks, those traveling steerage.  A small group can also pool all their
resources, for instance, charter a ship one-way just far enough as B5, and
hope to find work or new opportunities on far-away worlds.  When this doesn't
happen, they linger...sometimes for a long time.
