     BTW, I spoke today with the promotions people at KBHK San Francisco about
the B5/DS9 spots, and what they explained is that they have linked all of
their shows (sf) in one trailer as well as doing individual spots.  In one of
them, they go from Kung Fu to Time Trax to B5 to DS9.  So it's not a question
of using B5 material to promote DS9, simply that they appear in the same spot.
She's going to check their spots just to verify, but that's the explanation.
