     Actually, I didn't much like the "next Gene R" stuff.  That line has
appeared in a lot of places, and while it may help reporters get a grip  on a
Story Angle, it's misleading and just makes me wince.  Was Rod Serling "the
next Norman Corwin?"  (If you don't know who that is, find out.)  Was
Roddenberry the next Joe Stefano?  Is Orson Scott Card the next Piers Anthony?
(Hmm.....)

     In the voice of the Ren and Stimpy Cartoon Horse, "No, sir, I don't like
it.  Don't like it at all."
