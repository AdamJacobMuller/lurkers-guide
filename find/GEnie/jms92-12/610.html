     Basically, I think that there should be something on-screen if there
NEEDS to be something on-screen.  For instance, in both Sinclair's quaters and
the briefing room, you'll see monitors on the wall in BG and later used for
important stuff.  (That should be quarters, not quaters, which is what you
find on the moon.)  When not *actively in use* they display only the B5 logo,
sort of a carrier wave.  When a signal comes in from local, you get the BabCom
logo, then the signal.  When a signal comes in from a ship, or the computer
provides information, you go right from the B5 symbol straight to the display.
When it's over, you go back to the static symbol until it's needed again.

     The only real exceptions to this are a) the consoles in the observation
dome, which are going at all times to monitor incoming and outgoing ships, and
b) displays in the business areas which show the internal B5 Newscast and
commercials.
