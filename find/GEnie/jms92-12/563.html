     So far, the show has struck well with both SF fans and non-SF fans, which
bodes well.  We deliberately exposed the show to people who don't much care
for the genre, and they were very much taken.

     BTW, about 1/2 the ads for the B5 pilot are now sold, a fair amount of
time early.  The network folks figured if they had half of the ads sold by mid-
January, given the economy and how these things go, especially with new
programs, they'd be doing good.  To be at this point over two weeks early is a
very positive sign.

     As I write this, a 50 minute cassette is playing here in my office, the
soundtrack for Babylon 5.  I got a copy of the full soundtrack to a) verify
that some changes we'd requested were made (they were), and b) to see how the
soundtrack stood up just on its own terms.  It's very nice stuff.  Stewart
played with a variety of things, including sampling voices to use in some
scenes, played almost like an angelic chorus.

     In the next 2 weeks, we will be essentially finished with all of the post-
production on the movie...1 year and 2 months from when I first announced the
project here on GEnie.  What a ride....
