     If I see one more message with a one-liner on top and then ten zillion
lines of white space, which at 2400 baud go by too fast for me to read the
damn thing, so I have to then go back and find the number of the message, and
replay it time after time while hitting ^S to try adn stop it before it
scrolls past again, I am going to do someone serious damage.

     (Well, everyone ELSE was having a tirade....)

     Paula...you're responding to and arguing with something that only you
heard because it doesn't exist in the pilot.  The line that Sinclair says is,
"I managed to take out a fighter before they hit my stabalizers.  I was losing
control, I'd lost my team...." etc.  Not vertical stabalizers.   Just the
device that keeps the ship from spinning end over end by  controlling the
various thrusts.  No matter WHAT system you're using, you have to be able to
go from A to B, and the minute adjustments required, particularly if you're in
the midst of battle, are too complex for one person to make on the fly.  It
has to go through a computer.  If the  system _ hydraulics, pneumatics, air
thrust, fusion, whatever power you happen to prefer _ is damaged, it's going
to screw you up.

     THAT was the line.  And the Line.
