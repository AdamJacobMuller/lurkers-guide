     I've tended to lean more in the direction of individual computers _
multi-gigabyte systems small enough to fit on the wrist, which also serve as
communications systems called Links _ that are generally networked into the
B5 database/central computer system.  Ninety percent of any information you're
likely to need you probably already have in the Link; anything additional you
need, or if you need a direct interface with Babylon Central Computer, that
can be accomplished with a simple voice command.
