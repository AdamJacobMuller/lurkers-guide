     The script to the V mini is in my computer, and there aren't many copies
floating around.  At this point, I'd prefer to keep it that way.

     As for not being dead from exhaustion...I dunno...it's just what I do.  I
don't really give it much thought (though the last week or so of actual
filming on B5 was pretty awful, from a physical standpoint; damn near did me
in).

                                                               jms
