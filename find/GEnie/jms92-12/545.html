     A "religious/home shopping" network?  Pieces of the One True Cross on
sale, 35% off?  Some guy dressed as Moses suggesting that "We'll part the Red
Sea to give you the best price anywhere on our products"...?

     Thanks re: the photo.  I generally do *not* photograph well at all.
They get one head *in* focus, the other's out of focus, it takes forever to
airbrush out the horns, and the tail I don't even want to talk about.   I had
to finally have some b&amp;w's professionally done (by a woman who concluded that
the only way to make me loosen up in front of a camera was to dangle toys in
front of my face, just like she does with 5-year-olds) just to have SOMEthing
to give out.

     Well, I suppose we all have our cross to bear.  (Now marked down 20%,
move fast, we only have 5,000 left in inventory.)

     Oh...and Kosh sorta walks/glides.

                                                                jms
