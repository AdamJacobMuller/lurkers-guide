     Slow in the sense that I generally have 1-3 more projects going at any
given moment than is the case just now, but that's mainly due to the holidays,
and passing on some other gigs.  It's just that I get twitchy if I'm not
working on something at all times.  I *write*.  It's what I do.  Ten hours a
day, seven days a week, all year round excluding  Christmas eve (for my
spousal overunit's sake, mainly), New Year's, and my birthday.  If I stopped,
I'd go bananas.

     Stephen: the network pilot is mainstream, and the 10-hour project
is...not.  Which is all I'd prefer to say about it now until we get some firm
news.

     Generally speaking, I've been very fortunate in that I've never been
"typed" as one kind of writer or another; I've done comedy, horror, science
fiction, cop shows, fantasy, mystery, mainstream, originals, adaptations,
animation, live action, you name it, I've probably written it.  It helps a lot
the way the business is going these days to be able to show up wearing
whatever color hat is required for the job.

                                                                jms
