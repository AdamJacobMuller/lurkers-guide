     The TV Guide writer saw the pilot, as well as the other pilots, so that's
how that happened.  And you'll note how they approach SF; they want the slang,
they want to know who the Bad Guys and the Good Guys are, and feel no
compunction at all about giving away the ending.  Imagine if the shows were
mystery, what the reaction would be.  SF is treated and viewed differently.

     And re: the date for new shows given in the CFQ article, that ain't
accurate.  Fact is, as I've noted before, we can be filming new shows within 8
weeks of getting the word.  If the response on airing is high enough, and with
other circumstances with the network itself dealt with we could be on the air
by the end of this summer.  And that remains a very likely possibility.

                                                                 jms
