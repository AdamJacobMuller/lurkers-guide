     What shaketh is that Joe got up to his ears in alligators and put off
writing a brief intro to the current issue.  However, it got turned  in this
week, and Christy is in town tomorrow to go over my last minute revisions on
the current issue (faxed to me by her, it's all done otherwise), after which
she will get it to the printer probably within the coming week.  Expect it
shortly after Christmas.

                                                                 jms
