     No fanfic for the time being.  I have to back up KL on this one.

     We'll see Londo's _ spouse/spouses, I'm avoiding saying which _ in
time.

     Looking at this crossover stuff brings to mind a decision I had to make
early on.  I at one point thought, "Wouldn't it be great if we could make B5
the nexus point between ALL SF television and film universes?"  So you could
head down toward the customs area, and find somebody with a light sabre, walk
past a cylon, that sort of thing.  And part of it was very appealing, if
legally a nightmare given what would be required to get permission.  But
finally decided that the show has to be its own universe, unique and distinct.

     But part of me still longs to see a British phone box just sitting in the
middle of the central corridor....
