      Actually she's sitting at a table NEXT to someone reading "Universe
Today."  Well, let's see...John Iacovelli is in the opening montage at the bar
with another production designer (John's the one in the beard) when the
narrator mentions "businessmen and travelers"...Christy Marx can be seen, if
barely, in a couple of casino shots...you can barely make out Mojo in one
shot...we had a shot of the Spousal Overunit in another, but that was
cut...running the wheel of fortune is John Stears (in the beard) and Paul
Bryant (black sash and tux accompanying him)...Ron Thornton can  be seen as
one of the two homeless people sitting on the floor in the Brown Sector (he's
on the right)...one of our production assistants is a hooker just visible
behind them...there are a bunch of others in other casino shots...there's an
attractive blond woman sitting at a table in the bazaar who's our stunt-
woman...and that's all I can think of offhand.

     And to the obvious question: no, I'm not in any of the shots.  Neither is
our director.

                                                                 jms
