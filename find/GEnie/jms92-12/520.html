     The pilot airs the last week in February.

     The guns used are called PPGs (to answer another question), and any space
battle sequences will use CGI effects for weaponry there as well.

     There may have been a question I missed.  If so, my regrets; there's 64
new messages since last night (yikes!)!

     Oh, yeah, there was one more...it ain't making Warners watch the promos
that'll hasten B5 the Series onto the air.  It's deciding, as stated, if it'll
be in a second night of PTEN programming, or on the same night if something
doesn't work out, or some other option.  It's the timing that's being
determined.

     Once the ratings are all in on all the shows, we'll know more.

                                                              jms
