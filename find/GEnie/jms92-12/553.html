     It's not a big deal if you're just a viewer.  If it's your show, which
you've nursed and watched over and hoped for and fought for over five long and
grueling years...it's a big deal.

     Re: ownership...yes, the show is actually *owned* by Warners under the
terms of the contract, which is standard.  (Which is why you see, on old ST
and new TNG stuff, copyright by Paramount, not by Roddenberry.)  I have some
separation of rights in very specific areas.

     Re: sound...yes again, it's in full surround sound, so if your local
station handles surround, you've got it made.  And do crank it up; I've heard
sections of it, and it works *real* nice.  (There's this little black box
we've adapted from fighter plane audio that, for the series, may let us
*localize* the individual sounds in a 3-D fashion, but we'll have to see if we
can make the technology downward-compatible first.)

                                                                 jms
