     "Even if it succeeded in court...."  In that one little phrase is
encapsulated a year, possibly two, of depositions, interrogatories, counter-
interrogatories, legal fees up the yinyang, court appearances, and legal
maneuvering that can kill months of time that should otherwise be used in
writing.

     People can be crazy sometimes.
