     The logic on the door is this (sayeth our designers): the section into
which the door slides is jigsawed.  When the door closes, pins extrude between
the walls into the jigsaw sections of the door that fit into the wall.  This
creates an absolutely *solid* pressure door, much more so than a door that,
for instance, closes in the middle.  If the whole side of the door had to go
into the slot, it would be nearly impossible to move given the angles
involved.
