     I was at a party today at Pat Tallman's place, along with some other B5
cast members, and we screened some of the pilot for the guests who hadn't seen
anything before (to considerable ooohs and aaahs), and on the way home, my
thoughts turned to this forum, as they often tend to.

     I often get asked what it's like to do this show and see the result; the
reaction tonight got me thinking about the Old Timers here on the B5
discussion, the ones who've been here over a year now, and those who came
later, who've seen this go from the secret That Which Cannot Be Discussed
(remember that one?) to first word of shooting, the countdown to photography,
the daily reports from the set, the discussion of the characters and the
world...to now a point where you're finally seeing the result on commercials
and promos and will shortly be seeing the finished product (and, of course,
the number of you who have already seen most of the finished product)...and I
guess I was wondering what it's like from YOUR perspective...?

                                                                jms
