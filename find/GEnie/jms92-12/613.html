     Well, hmm....I guess I can come out with this now.  As you know, it was
our plan to go for a very androgynous Delenn _ a male voice (which was to be
computer/electronically altered), female mannerisms, and a very ambiguous
makeup.  We've now gone through about every possible electronic alteration,
and frankly, none of them sound as convincing as I'd like.   Many of them
sound *okay*, but we've taken a hard and fast position on this show that
"okay" is simply not sufficient.

     So we've decided to leave Delenn female, with the performer's original
voice intact and unaltered.  Interestingly enough, when the performance was
shown at Wishcon and LosCon, the audience responded very positively to her
natural voice, urging that it be left alone.  Which is now what we're going to
do.

                                                                   jms
