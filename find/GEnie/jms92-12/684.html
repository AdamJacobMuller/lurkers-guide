     For those keeping track of new items in the press about B5....

     * Expect a round up of new SF series, including B5, to appear in USA
Today in the next 7-10 days.

     * Another round up of shows, including B5, is tentatively slated to
appear in the January 9 issue of TV Guide.

     * The piece on the B5/Genie connection for the LA Times Magazine "Palm
Latitudes" section should likely appear December 20th or 27th.

     (Not directly related to B5, but I just *have* to mention it
somewhere...my short story, "Say Hello, Mister Quigley," which appeared
recently in both Pulphouse and the Midnight Grafitti softcover anthology ended
up in the Recommended Stories section of the December Locus.  It was the only
story selected from that issue of Pulphouse, and it's right alongside stories
by Brian Aldiss and John Varley and others.)

                                                                 jms
