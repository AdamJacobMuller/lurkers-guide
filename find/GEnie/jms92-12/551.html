     It ain't that they think B5 is a risk.  The situation is simply this:
they've booked up the first night of the network with two series.   That's
what they have room for.  Question now is, do they open up a second night, for
which B5 would be the anchor, or do they replace one of the other shows should
one of them not perform to expected levels (which is the risk on any network)?
They won't have the information to make that decision until B5 *and* the other
shows hit the air.

     That's really the full extent of it.

     Re: music and sound...the music is finished.  About 50 minutes worth,
sections of which are interpolated and cycled through various portions of the
movie.  Which for TV is a *lot*, by the way; in final form, it gives you
almost wall-to-wall music.  (An average TV movie gets maybe 30 minutes worth.)
I've heard most of the sound effects, and we're now in the process of a)
finishing the looping, and b) locking down the sound EFX.  We do the final mix-
down starting January 4 and ending January 8.

     On January 11, I will have two copies of the final, complete B5 movie in
my hot little hands.  On SVHS.  One for home, one for the archives.  In full
surround sound.
