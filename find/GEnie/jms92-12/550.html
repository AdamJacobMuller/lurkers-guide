     Yes, there will eventually be a B5 tech manual, which I believe Ron
Thornton will supervise.

     Re: telling stations what you think if you've seen the pilot...that's
something I really hadn't thought about.  On the merits of about ten seconds
worth of thought, it looks like a good idea.  So yeah...if anyone who's seen a
preview of B5 (the whole thing) wants to tell your local station that you
liked it, feel free.  The more heat the better.

     By gosh, the ideas that come up in a place like this....
