     Yes, but strong feelings can bleed through.  And it's easier for a more
advanced Psi to shut it all out; Lyta, at P5 rating, is about in the middle,
and B5 is her first major assignment.  Her position (in terms of psi-rating)
is one reason why she wears gloves and long-sleeved outfits that cover as much
as possible; it makes it easier to shut things out if there's no direct
contact.  When and if she makes it up to a P7 or P8, it becomes less of a
problem.
