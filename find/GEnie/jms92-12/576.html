     How do I stay sitting down that long, you ask?

     You ever own a staple-gun....?

     Re: the "Stegosaurus" adaptation...yeah, it was fun, and based on a fun
character, although the network didn't actually want the specific story,
something new using it.  So I got to play in that world a little.   My
favorite moment, a scene I came up with: the steg is always sneaking up on
this one kid, and finally the kid's reacion is how can somethilng big sneak up
on anyone?  The steg thought about it a second, shrugged (as best a steg CAN
shrug), and said, "You watch rabbits for a hundred thousand years...you
learn."

     Oh...re: TV Guide...they indicated that B5 came first, not the other way
around.  It's Newsweek that got it backwards.
