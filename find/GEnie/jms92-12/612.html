     Just to clarify, the pouch is for *after* birth, not before; the newborn
Narn leaves the mother's body and enters the father's pouch.  (At least,
that's what Catherine Adair came up with...it ain't canon yet, I haven't
decided if that's a Good Idea or not.)

     Re: Non-humanoid...bear in mind, you still haven't seen what Kosh is
inside that suit...others, very non-humanoid, will make their appearances down
the road...and there's one race that has not yet been heard from, one shadow
government so secretive its existence is only whispered about, and when *they*
make their appearance, and you finally see what *they* look like...well, let's
just say that I've talked at some length with our EFX people, and it'll take
about 2 years to work out how to do this and make it credible.

                                                                  jms
