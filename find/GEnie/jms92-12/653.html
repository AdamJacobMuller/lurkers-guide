     Sue, if you're finding tall people ALWAYS sit in front of you, and you
sit on the aisle, you may want to consider the fact that these two events are
related.

     See, I stand about 6'4" or 6'5" (I can never remember which), and going
to a film can be an amazing experience.  I never knew my knees could actually
go on either side of my ears.  To minimize this, I (and most tall people I
know) sit on the aisle, so we can stick our legs out the side while
desperately trying to avoid tripping anyone.

                                                              jms
