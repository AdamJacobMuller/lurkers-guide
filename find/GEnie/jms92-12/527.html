     (the grinding of teeth like tectonic plates)...there is no "Bob" in the
show, not nohow, not noway, that was a background prosthetic critter that the
E! folks grabbed and used to intro their piece.  It's got nothing to do with
our show.

     (I'm calm, calm, perfectly calm....)

     Re: the photo...it's amazing how many people tell me, "You know, you look
JUST LIKE so-and-so."  Just one of those faces, I guess.  Thankfully very few
people to whom I've been compared have elected to sue....
