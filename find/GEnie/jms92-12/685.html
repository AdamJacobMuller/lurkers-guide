     Yes, "Quigley" originally began as a TZ script, which the studio (MGM)
loved, my exec producer loved...EXCEPT they thought the subject matter _
incest _ was too controversial.  (Many of the folks at MGM operated out of

YYYYAAAAAGGGGHHHHHHH!!!!

     (Sorry, that was my head exploding.)

     Anyway, they said they'd produce the episode IF I removed that  aspect of

it, gave back the money, and squirreled it away until I could adapt it to
fiction later.
