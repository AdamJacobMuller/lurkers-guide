     Mmmmmm....maybe.  And there are some shots that do so in clearer terms;
in the council chamber are CGI "recorders," floating devices that record video
and audio of the proceedings.  They float above the heads of the characters,
and later one of them goes between two characters as they walk out the door.
So yeah, there's some, just not on the scale of looking at starships...well,
except for the scene in the garden, which is CGI....
