     Garibaldi is a security chief, and not into karate or stuff on that
order.  Just a good roundhouse blow.

     When I said "cute robots" (which I still stand behind firmly), I was
referring largely to things like Tweaky from Buck Rodgers.  We will get into
the question of robotics and artificial intelligence on the show, but I'm
going to try for a different take on it.

                                                                 jms
