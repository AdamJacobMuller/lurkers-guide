     I imagine that we'll do some interacting (actors/cgi) as noted, but we
will also do some actual ship-building.  For instance, in the pilot, when Kosh
arrives in the docking bay, there's a shot past him into the bay, where you
can see part of his ship (we actually built a fairly large section of it,
though only a small part is visible).  I think that shot is in the CFQ
article.  We also built (and then trashed) a spider transport to match the
CGI, though again you can't really tell because it's pretty demolished by the
time the actors get to it.  There will be more of this done down the road.

                                                                jms
