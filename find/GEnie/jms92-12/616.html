     The consideration I brought to the issue was largely this: when the
planned male/female shift took place, there should have been substantial
differences such that the change MADE a difference; if Delenn came out talking
just the same, sounding the same, then the change becomes trivial.
 It isn't saying "male voices sound this way," it's s go from A to B, the
difference should be noticeable."

                                                                   jms
