     I honestly don't know what the individual syndex rules will be as they
apply to various stations.  Your best bet there is to go straight to the
source...the station itself.

     As for the details of sound and sound effects...maybe the "average
viewer" (whatever the heck *that* is) will or won't notice, but *I* will know
it's there.

                                                                  jms
