     Just to reinforce the preceding...B5 is not a battlefield, and its
internal (personnel) defense systems are more basic.  Security guards simply
don't go into combat, and if they were fully outfitted, they would destroy the
station in its first engagement.

     We really haven't seen any EA ground soldiers yet (though there is a
story in the works about them, tentatively called "Gropos," for ground
pounders).

                                                                     jms
