     For those who watch "Points of Departure" when it airs, keep a sharp ear
out...our friend Mr. Jarvis gets plinked.

     With maybe one or two exceptions, all *I* get are gif images, since those
are quickest to make and get off Ron's system.  (John Copeland and I download
images comprising the top and bottom frames of EFX shots for approval...I've
got something like 80 megabytes of the stuff.)

                                                                   jms
