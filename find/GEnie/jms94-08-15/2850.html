     Kwicker..."What if Joe wrote a story in which a "memory-challenged"
person DISCOVERED records of who or what he was?"

     I was in the process of developing that as a b-story in an upcoming
episode.

     Because of that comment, I now have to scuttle the story.

     I understand that this proceeds from enthusiasm on everyone's part, but
let me repeat this as forcefully as I can: NO STORY IDEAS.  No matter what
anyone says, what disclaimers are put up, if I see a story idea that is
something we're doing or contemplating doing...I have to scuttle it to protect
the series.

     This has just torpedoed what would've been a very compelling little b-
story.

     Everyone, please, be *very* careful about this...the only other  option I
have, if it begins happening too much, is to dive out of the discussion, and
I'd *really* rather not have to do that.

                                                                jms
