     I imagine the pilot will air again eventually, though I don't know when;
and as for the end of the story...the only way I was able to get this far is
to focus on only one reality: that the show would get sold, the pilot would
get made, the series would begin and run five years, to  the end.  If I ever
allowed any other possibility to enter my fevered brain, it never would've
come about.  So I can't even *consider* that question, well-meaning as it is.
