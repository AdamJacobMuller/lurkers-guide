     B5 novel #1, figure late November/early December.  For the CDRom, figure
January.

     On the comic, the artists will change with each 4-issue cycle; initially,
they're using Michael Netzer and Rob Leigh.  The first issue is a JMS script;
2-4 is a JMS premise translated into script by Mark Moretti.
