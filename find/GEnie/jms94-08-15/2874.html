     You're also looking at this from a strictly English-speaking perspective;
in German, for instance, 21 is "Ein und Zwanzig" (pardon any misspellings in
there, it's been a while) which is exactly the same structure, albeit
reversed, used for Minbari counting (and, in fact, is more or less what I
based his "statement" on).

                                                                 jms
