     Requested, we deliver...just uploaded cruiser.gif to the B5 library
(#1260), which is a shot of a Minbari war cruiser.

     Main obstacle to uploading more is that even though I'm free flagged, the
GEnie access numbers don't allow 9600 baud for such flags, and I have to log
on at 2400 baud, which means it takes 15 minutes or so to upload a single
file, as opposed to about 3 minutes on other systems.

                                                              jms
