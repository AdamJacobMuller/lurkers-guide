     The pages that I've seen are quite nice.  (Kaluta is doing the cover.)  I
really enjoy writing comics, though I haven't done as many as I'd like, and
may contribute one of the arcs down the road (the arc that immediately follows
my one-shot is by Mark Moretti, based on a premise by jms).

     Here's a spoiler for "Chrysalis," just for fun.

     Something mysterious happens; then something ominous happens; then
something wonderful happens; then something astonishing happens; then
something even more mysterious happens; then something *terrible* happens;
then *another* terrible thing happens; then three more mysterious and ominous
things happen.

                                                                jms
