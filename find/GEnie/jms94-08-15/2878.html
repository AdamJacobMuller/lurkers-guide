     Centauri females, btw, have six narrow...ummm...slots on their backs,
three on either side of the spine, right around the base of the spine.

     The awful thing is that the two women in props -- who were having  FAR
too much fun with this -- kept bringing me the tentacle to verify the shape,
size, consistency, do we see veins or not....

     I tell you here and now: our staff meetings are something else.

                                                               jms
