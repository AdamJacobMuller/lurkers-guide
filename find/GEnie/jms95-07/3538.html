     I've just been told today that the comic has been extended through issue
#24.  So it's clear for over a full year yet to come.  There should be
something official about this out soonish.

     This should give it a decent shot at finding its audience, which is
already building (40,000+ copies per month ain't bad).

                                                                  jms
