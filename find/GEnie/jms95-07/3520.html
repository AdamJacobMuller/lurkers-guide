     For most of our history with WB, the shield's attitude has been sort of
lackluster when it comes to PR.  Particularly for the first year or so, during
their trial of a new concept in TV: stealth programming.  You do  as much as
you can to make the show invisible to eye, ear, radar, sonar and infrared,
lest god forbid somebody should write an article about it.   We had *constant*
battles with them over this. 

     We think the situation is finally, slowly improving.  A great deal of the
problem comes from the fact that we're a) not a network show, and b) not a
Warners in-house series, like Kung Fu or the other PTEN shows.  We're an
independent production company, and thus we tended to get orphaned/neglected a
lot.

                                                                   jms
