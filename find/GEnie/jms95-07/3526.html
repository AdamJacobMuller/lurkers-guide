     PS.  So in other words, Stan, if you want to post this material all over
the place, on an episode that hasn't yet aired yet, totally not respecting my
wishes on the subject, as the creator of B5, because you believe your right to
post this is greater than my polite and respectful request to the fans who
attended NOT to publicly post such things, then do as you wish, knowing that
you kill any future screenings for other people.  

                                                                   jms
