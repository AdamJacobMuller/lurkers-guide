     Y'know...we despair here about how the media (viz: TV Guide and others)
can only think to describe B5 by comparing it to ST, why can't they get it
together...I just blipped over to the category for NASFIC, the US proxy
Worldcon...and there are panels on Star Wars, on the Fox shows, including X-
Files, all this...and you know the only B5 panel I found?  BABYLON 5 VS. STAR
TREK.

     sigh....
