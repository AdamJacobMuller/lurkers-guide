     I think the idea of a fan-run con is great.  And be *sure* that wherever
you do choose has a) adequate transportation in and out, b) something to do
when the con's not in session, c) good hotels centrally located to the
convention.

     I like Tom's approach above; it gives all the various departments a
chance to get their moment in the sun, AND provide solid info on those aspects
of making the series that would be of interest to different people.

     What we have here, really, is the chance to re-think and re-create the
convention process a little, make it more active, and inter-active, and more
interesting.

     One thing to be advised about: actors are paid to perform.  This is
performance, however one might choose to consider it otherwise.  So any cast
members brought in are going to require some kind of compensation, travel and
the like.  Just a reminder to keep in the back of your head(s) as you plan all
this stuff out.

                                                                      jms
