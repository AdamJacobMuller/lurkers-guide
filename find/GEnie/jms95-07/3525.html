     Except, of course, that I'd specifically asked for people NOT to post
that info; if this has been done, then this is the first time that request has
not been honored.  I've done these screenings in the cooperative sense that it
will be kept to the crowd and not posted publicly; even gotthe  audience to
agree with it.  If this promise has been broken, I may have to reconsider the
screening process.
