     AND FURTHERMORE, *Stan*....I just checked AOL.  The synopsis one person
wrote there was *never* posted publicly insofar as I could see, and was noted
that if anyone wanted to see it, it would be sent via email to that
individual.  Why?  Because the person who saw the ep understood and respected
my request, and didn't want it posted publicly.  If that person had, it
would've been.  So you're even going against the wishes of the person who
WROTE the synopsis.

                                                                      jms
