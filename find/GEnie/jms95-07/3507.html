     We're doing a bit more here and there on merchandising, just enough to
keep it going and provide quality assurance.

     BTW, in the ongoing saga of Big Bang Screwups...heard today that, in
addition to Michael O'Hare getting stiffed the $5,000 remaining on his  fee,
Mark Hamill's check for the balance of his fee (a remainder of $10,000) has
bounced, this on top of a previous check to reimburse travel expenses ALSO
bouncing.

     These people are unbelievable....

                                                                      jms
