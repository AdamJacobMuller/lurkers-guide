     The shadows know that Kosh knows, because the Vorlons *always* know; they
also know (or think) that they're in a superior position because if Kosh
should tell the others, either a) most wouldn't believe him, or b) the shadows
would move aggressively now, costing untold lives.  They're more worried about
an alliance between lots of races than the Vorlons alone.
