      Mike, would *love* to see a copy of that review; could you send it to me
at 14431 Ventura Boulevard, Suite 260, Sherman Oaks, CA 91423?  I would *very*
much appreciate it.

    (If you could include the cover, that'd also be great.)

                                                                  jms
