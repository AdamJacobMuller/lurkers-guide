     Our pilot got one emmy nomination (won that one); season one got two noms
(won one), and our third season has just gotten three Emmy nominations, with
the possibility of one or two more to come.  We got noms for makeup, hair and
cinematography.  Nominations for directing, music, EFX and a few other areas
will be out in the next couple/three weeks, when the last of the ballots are
counted.  Nothing for the cast or writers, alas, but that's typical for SF.
