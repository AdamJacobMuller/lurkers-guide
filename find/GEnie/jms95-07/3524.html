     Stan, y'know the only thing that kinda bothers me?  I see you over here,
on AOL, elsewhere, posting all these spoilers...and that's all you seem to do.
I don't see you engaging in discussions, it seems to me as if your main
interest is in just grabbing the information and racing to all the forums to
be first with spoilers.  I find this rather peculiar.

                                                                 jms
