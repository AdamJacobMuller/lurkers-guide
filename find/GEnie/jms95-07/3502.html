     I hear there's even going to be a jms card in the first batch of 120
cards.  (I have now achieved something, I am now a trading card.)   There will
be cards for every episode, in chronological order, and they can trace some
arc elements and stuff.  They look to be gorgeous, all based on photographs,
many never before published or seen.

     People entitled to wear BotL patches: me, Michael O'Hare, and John
Copeland.

                                                                   jms
