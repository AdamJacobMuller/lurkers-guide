     Mr. T, Louise is correct; also, in the TOS show, that revelation was the
whole *point* of the episode, where here it's a filligree, dropped in at the
last.  It also *has* to be that character, as the flip side of the story, to
contrast with Sheridan's "holy cause" as warning, and because of his own
reflection of what Delenn might have been if she went the wrong way for the
right reasons.  

                                                                        jms
