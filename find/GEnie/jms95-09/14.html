     Kevin: yeah...real fragging funny...at times like this I long for a REAL
Narn bat squad.

     Re: "fanboys"...actually, there's been precious little of that.  The only
ongoing problem that I've yet encountered is the occasional net-weasel
celebrity stalker who goes out of his way to constantly post absolute untrue
lying crap to try and hurt either me, or B5, or some cast members, or all
three.  Day after day after day.  

                                                                   jms
