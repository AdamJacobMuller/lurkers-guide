     George: the mistake everyone makes is in going for somebody famous, a
celebrity.  I've done a lot of looking into this, and have spoken with a
number of other Ripperologists, and the single most likely person is one who's
name you've never heard mentioned as a suspect, but if you read the record,
his name keeps coming up again and again and again.  

                                                                      jms
