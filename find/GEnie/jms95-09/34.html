     Yeah, it's the CP experience, and others, that kinda soured me on
merchandising a little.  I walked off CP when it looked like the sponsor was
going to get increased say in episode content.  And other shows have thrown
stuff in just so they could include it in merchandising...so I'm just a bit
leery of it all.
