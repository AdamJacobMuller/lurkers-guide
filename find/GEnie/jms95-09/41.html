     It's actually an interesting experiment in learning, in that it's
absolutely clear what the brain does...when you stop playing, your brain keeps
seeing these falling blocks every time you close your eyes, and what it's
doing is working out each possible combination, so you can react more
instinctively (yellow Ls go on the left, green Ls on the right, both top down,
to slide in)...it's really mental evolution in action, the learning process
given color and shapes.

     It's also absolutely a useless skill.
