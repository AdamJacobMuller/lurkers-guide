     Re: Earth's attitude toward the Centauri...stick around for 2 more
episodes.

     Re: not recognizing the Centauri rule...on what basis would or could
Earth do this?  If the Narns had not agreed to total and unconditional
surrender, sure, there might be a case you could make...otherwise, one doesn't
have a leg to stand on.

     Vampyr...okay, (poink), I've now made you Babylon 5 Person here.   So how
could Sheridan "take Londo down a peg" in any manner consistent with reality? 
Yell at him?  Sure, but to what effect?  He had nothing to back it up. 
Before, in "Shadows," he had a bluff he could run; now that's not relevant
because the actions have all been taken, and there is nothing that can be done
to stop it.  Sometimes, things happen in the real world, and we'd love to see
the person taken down a peg, as you say...but sometimes actually *doing* that
in a real world situation, or a fairly rigorous fictional situation, is a
different matter.

                                                                  jms
