     The article can be sent to me via the B5 mail drop, which is:  14431
Ventura Boulevard, Suite 260, Sherman Oaks, CA 91423.  

     Sometimes I write shows with a lot of EFX, sometimes I write shows with
zip EFX.  "Parliament of Dreams" was that way, so was "Inquisitor," which had
almost no EFX.  Same, as I recall, for "The Quality of Mercy."   It's whatever
the story requires.
