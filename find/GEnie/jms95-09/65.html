     Never thought the ep was being trashed, just responding.  If one picks
nits with shows, one should also be free to pick nits on messages.   Just the
usual give and take.

     Remembered an interesting quote this afternoon: "Of course everything has
already been said.  But since no one was listening, we must begin again."

                                                                    jms
