     A-TC: yes, Londo *does* have his moments when one almost likes him in
spite of oneself; the second episode of year three has scenes in which you
don't like him, and then you *do* like him enormously...then you don't again. 
He's caught in the scissors...and trying madly to find some way out of the
situation he's in.
