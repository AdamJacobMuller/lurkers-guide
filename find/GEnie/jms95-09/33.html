     The other thing to bear in mind -- and as a video editor, you understand -
- is that by the time we've finished an episode, I've seen it maybe 15-20
times, and personally, with Copeland, edited every single frame of every
episode.  After a while, much as you like it, you just don'wanna see it no
more....
