     Sounds like a definite glitch; anyone else notice this on the satellite
uplink?

     Ron: yes and no.  We hadn't heard of the Bureau 13 game when we did the
episode, it was just something we came up with 'cause it sounded neat.  Later,
we found out there was a game by that name.  At which point I decided that it
wouldn't be appropriate to use that name again, and had a good conversation
with some folks at the game company about it.  There was no problem, I just
didn't want to walk on their turf intentionally or otherwise.  Logically, any
secret group is going to change its name from time to time *anyway* (it's not
like they're in the yellow pages or anything), so the organization would
remain under varying names.
