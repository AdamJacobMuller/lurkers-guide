     A statement is anything; everything ever written can be taken as one kind
of political statement or other.  (Often read in after the fact.)   The
question is one of political *agenda*, and that I don't have; I've fronted
episodes on every end of the political spectrum, because I'm not enough of a
follower to think *any* party, group or affiliation has the market on right
answers.
