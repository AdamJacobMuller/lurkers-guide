      I'd be very surprised; it's finding its audience, and it isn't a bad
show.  I know it's hideously expensive -- I hear about $2 million per episode -
- and they've had a lot of problems with CGI, but all of that can be either
overcome of compensated for.  It'd be a loos. Er, loss.

                                                                   jms
