     Y'know...this is a nutty idea...maybe just ignore it...but I got wind
last year about a station in...Italy? Greece?...one or the other that went
bankrupt and shut down *literally* in the middle of airing a B5 episode.   The
next day, during the lunch time period, hundreds of protesters showed up with
placards demanding they show the rest of the episode.  This got substantial
coverage, apparently, and convinced another station to pick up the show.

     So I look around at the net, at the sharp local people who want to help,
the great graphics that are out there that can be used, the  organizational
resources on the net.....

     It's a nutty idea.
