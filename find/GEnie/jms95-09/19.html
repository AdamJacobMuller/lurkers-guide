      You cannot prove the non-existence of something; you can only require
proof of the *existence* of something.  If I say, "There are green penguins at
the North Pole," it is not incumbent upon you to prove they're *not* there;
however you search I could always say, "Well, you missed a spot."   The burden
of proof is incumbent upon the person making the assertion.

     This is basic, critical thinking, which is often not taught in places
where it *should* be taught.  

     Quickie note on the clip-show discussion...this is starting to veer into
story suggestions, so I'd suggest a slight retreat.

     BTW, for those also on AOL, Bruce and I are doing an on-line conference
tomorrow (Tuesday) night at 7p.m. Pacific to officially open up the B5 AOL
page.
