     Yeah, well, *I've* got Ultraviolet Level Clearance, personally assigned
to me by President Santiago (before his unfortunate demise), so there.

     Actually, the Pentagon likes me...was invited to the Air Force Academy
2024 Study Group as a participant at Maxwell AFB by a Lieutenant General
(unfortunately had to decline for various reasons), we get care packages from
some folks at the Pentagon...hey, if you can't tell us, who CAN you tell?

                                                                jms*

sources)
