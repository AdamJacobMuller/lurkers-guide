     Lots of interesting stuff...new main title is finished and scored, with
the first two new episodes arriving in the hands of critics and reviewers this
week...finished writing script #11, "Confessions" (which title may change if I
can think up something better), which is now the exact midway point, both in
the series overall, and this season in particular...also finished writing the
first issue of a 4-part miniseries for the DC comics B5 book, which will still
come out at irregular periods, titled "The Book of the War."  

     Also got in the first volume in the next batch of Dell novels,  "Clark's
Law" by J. Mortimer, and so far it's really extremely good, I'm quite pleased.
The other two are by S. M. Stirling and Neal Barrett, Jr.  Should be getting
them in soon for review.

     The B5 AOL and WWW pages should jointly be up in the next 2 weeks.

     And in Los Angeles, B5's first new ep got a 6.5 rating with a 10 share
(very good), while DS9, an hour before, got a 5.9 rating and a 9 share.  

     Have begun shooting episode 11, "Messages From Earth," a hideously
complex episode, outmatched only by #10, "Severed Dreams," which is the single
most visually ambitious episode we've done in the three years of the show. 
It's just totally outrageous, and it'll probably kill us in sheer man-hours to
produce...but the result should drop jaws all over the place.

                                                                   jms
