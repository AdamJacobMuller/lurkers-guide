      General Answer For What Comes Now:

      Yes, I *know* it's the East End not the West End; I looked right at my
notes when I was writing the script, and they said East and I typed West and
nobody noticed it until it went out.  I could've replaced it with a looped
line prior to first airing here, as this was found during the UK airings, but
looping never improves only diminishes the performance, and he's on-camera and
the words wouldn't match his mouth.  So I decided to let it go out this way
once for performance, and we'll correct this aspect with a loop in later
airings, even though that will somewhat lessen the performance aspect.

                                                                    jms
