     Actually, Delenn was never told the whole situation, so she would have
had no way of knowing to stick around; also, it was something they had to do
on their own.

     The Talia "incident" is referenced again in "Dust to Dust," and possibly
one more episode in the first 11.

     None of the actors have *contracts* for five years, we have options ON
them for that period, which we can exercise at our discretion.

                                                                   jms
