      Vampyr: don't worry, your reaction is exactly right.  If Londo's actions
bug one, they should, because we hate to see them.  And what makes this show
strong, I think, is that we *are* very rigorous and logical in how we put
together the politics of our universe.  There aren't a lot of holes you can
point to in this one.

     Could G'Kar try and form a government in exile?  He probably could, and
they may be worried about that...so who knows what they might do...?
