     Hmmm...I think the episode must be "Dust to Dust," with a quick scene
between Sheridan and a merchant...good scene.

     BTW, for those in the LA area, the comic store Phantom Zone (formerly
Outer Limits), on Ventura Boulevard half a block west of Van Nuys (tucked away
next to the Coogee Bay Cafe) has quite a few complete boxes of the B5 cards
that just came in.

                                                               jms
