       "He wishes confirmation."  Any catholics in here want to comment a
little further on what that means?

       Re: Colin Powell...I'm cautiously optimistic.  One of the real dangers
is that, not knowing perhaps as much as we should about him, is that he has
the potential to become the empty vessel into which we pour all of our
expectations about what he *could* be, or what we *think* he is...and see not
him, but our own reflection, which is always appealing to a restless
population seeking the next tall rider on a horse.  

       That said...I do find much of what I've seen quite intriguing, and if
the rest is revealed to match what seems to be his personality and record, I
think I might be inclined to vote for him.

                                                                     jms
