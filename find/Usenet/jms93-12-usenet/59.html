<H2>Question on writing...</H2>
21 Dec 1993<PRE>     Well, it's not really like ST *or* NYPD (or many other alphabet
shows).  It's kind of a weird balancing act.
 
     As with any television show, in any given episode there is a Problem
facing our characters.  A danger, a negotiation, a visitor, whatever; it
has to be dealt with within that hour.  But when all is said and done,
little threads have been introduced that begin to very lightly link other
shows together.  For instance, a thread introduced in "Midnight" rises
again in "Legacies" and "By Any Means Necessary."  In other shows, there
is a character introduced who returns later, upon whose return visit we
learn something different about them.  Some threads won't even LOOK like
threads the first time you see an episode; they'll just skate past
without drawing undue attention.  It's only later, on seeing some later
shows, that you will suddenly twig to something in the first episode.
The best comparison I can come up with is one of those rohrscharch tests,
where it looks like an inkblot picture of an urn...until someone tells
you that it's actually two people kissing...and then suddenly, WHAM!, you
see it, and now you can't see anything else, and can't believe you didn't
see it in the first place.
 
     That, at least, is the theory.  We'll see how it all works starting
in about a month.  It's really an experiment; no one's done anything this
large, over so great a planned span before.  Should be interesting....
