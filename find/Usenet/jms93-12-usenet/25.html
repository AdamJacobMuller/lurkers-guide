<H2>Starship.gif</H2>
7 Dec 1993<PRE>     I think what you're referring to in starship.gif is NOT something
that was uploaded by, or authorized by us...and is based on a photo that
appeared, mistakenly, in Starlog, which had nothing to do with our
series.  (Several such photos appeared in that spread, including a brick
foundry.)  The starship.gif file has *nothing* to do with Babylon 5, and
should be deleted from the ftp site.
