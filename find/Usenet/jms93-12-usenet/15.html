<H2>A Couple Questions</H2>
5 Dec 1993<PRE>     There may be a two-parter in our first season, though not the
cliffhanger episode.  Which is all I can say on that at this time.
 
     Re: science advisors...we have a few we use from time to time, but
for the most part our people KNOW sf, and those who design the EFX KNOW
science, and our writers are good SF writers, so it really isn't much of
a problem, we haven't had to go outside much at all.  We had to go to our
medical advisor recently for some terminology, but we're happily very
self-sufficient in that regard.  Nearly everyone involved in the show from
a certain level on is a techno-wonk, and will sit for *hours* with you
discussing how many feet per second a starfury travels when it first
drops out of the cobra bay (I believe it's 32 fps), and so on.
