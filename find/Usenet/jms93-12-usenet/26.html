8 Dec 1993<PRE>     Jesus...don't yell.  I was talking as myself, about how fast a
Starfury drops out of the cobra bay, this isn't B5 canon, this didn't show
up in a script, this is just informal talk.  I'm sure if we have to go
into measurements in the show, we'll either go metric or find some new
system altogether.  (I believe we've used kilometers in at least one
episode.)  Anyway...relax....
