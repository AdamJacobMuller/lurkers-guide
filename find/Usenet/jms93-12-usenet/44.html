<H2>Gays</H2>
12 Dec 1993<PRE>      We have no intention of avoiding the gay question.  We will not,
however, do a "gay story," which is usually described by those friends and
acquaintances of mine in derogatory terms...a la, "fags are people too."
 The sense I get is that they resent the hell out of that kind of
patronizing approach.  The one suggestion that comes most often is, "Why
not simply introduce a character, we get to know that character over the
run of a season, and at some point discover, practically in passing, that
this person is bi or gay...*don't* make a big issue out of it, just show
it."
 
     And that's what we're going to do.
