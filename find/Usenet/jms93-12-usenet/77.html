<H2>Re: Tamlym Tomita</H2>
27 Dec 1993<PRE>     I will tell you a true thing: it's been so long since we finished
the pilot, and I've now directly supervised and written the bulk of 16
episodes, and...I honestly can't remember how tightly sequential the
individual scenes were/are in the pilot.  It all blurs after a while,
after the sheer bulk of the series to date.  I'll try and check it out.
