7 Dec 1993<PRE>     Of course, one problem with your message is that there are very few
black australian actors in L.A., particularly if you're talking about
aborigine actors.  This complicates casting.  That said, however, we are
casting outside the usual American parameters as much as we can...and
there *were* "turbans" (to use your phrase) in the pilot; check the
business room scene, and others.  And there are more in the series.  We
are working as hard as possible to get as wide a view of the future as we
can.
