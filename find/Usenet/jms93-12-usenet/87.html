<H2>Questions,Questions and More Q</H2>
31 Dec 1993<PRE>     To a message with nothing but questions, a reply with nothing but
answers.
 
     Yes.  It would seem so, yes.  Probably, but so far nothing's been set
as far as I know.  No.  There are contingencies, but the B5 story ends at
year five, period.  I can't even consider that possibility at this time.
Yes.
