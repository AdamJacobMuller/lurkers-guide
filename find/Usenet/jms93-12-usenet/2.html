<H2>Legal aspects of the Bablyon 5</H2>
1 Dec 1993<PRE>     Going over all the information required for a decent answer to your
question would take a very long time; suffice to say that we continue to
look to the legal aspects of the B5 universe for complications and areas
of conflict; and we're thinking through that legal system *very* carefully;
look for some interesting extrapolations on this subject later in our first
season....
