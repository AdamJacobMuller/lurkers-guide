<H2>Thoughts from a lurker</H2>
11 Dec 1993<PRE>     Though there was CGI involved with Power, it was Ron who really
brought the idea of doing CGI for B5 to the forefront; we'd previously
figured on using models.  This was about 2 years before we went on the
air with the pilot.
 
     We're trying to work out the languages to some detail, but not as
much as I'd like, at this point.  It'll probably have to wait until the
post-season hiatus before I can sit down and really start pulling
together a rough dictionary of sorts.
