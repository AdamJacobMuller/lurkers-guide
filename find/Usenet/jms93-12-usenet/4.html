<H2>Re: Query to JMS on a minor po</H2>
1 Dec 1993<PRE>     In "Midnight," Sinclair had to be pretty much in command mode all
during the episode as a character, so that influences the result.  But in
later episodes, we get him out of those situations, out of uniform, and
into other settings where he can be more relaxed.  So that's coming, and
you'll see it *very* early on in the first season.
