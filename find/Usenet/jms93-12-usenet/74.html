<H2>book?</H2>
26 Dec 1993<PRE>     Your friend is mistaken.  When I created Babylon 5 -- my own concept
-- Warners did a search to make sure that the title hadn't been used or
copyrighted elsewhere.  The search turned up a number of Babylon 2's, one
Babylon 3, and an unpublished song entitled Babylon 4, but happily, no
Babylon 5.  There has not been a book published with that name, insofar
as we have ever been able to tell.  It's most likely that what your friend
is thinking of is a book entitled "Alas, Babylon," by Pat Frank, which is
a very fine novel indeed, and was written in about the period you mention.
