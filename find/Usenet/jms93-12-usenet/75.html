<H2>B5 on break?</H2>
26 Dec 1993<PRE>     The cast and crew have a production break from last Thursday until
just after New Year's.  It's a chance for all concerned to catch their
breath.  The writing continues during this time, as does much of the CGI
and a few other areas.
 
     Don't have the details on the U.K. situation  yet.
