<H2>Poll</H2>
10 Dec 1993<PRE>     If I might make a suggestion...it seems to me that a poll on the
B5 pilot at this time is fairly useless.  In most cases, it's been almost
a year since anyone's seen the pilot, and that will affect things.  It's
also a little unfair to do it at this time.  We've hashed and rehashed
the pilot, its qualities and deficits, over and over and over...we're
six weeks from the *series* going on line...would it not be better to
do a poll of the series instead, once it gets going?
