<H2>Time Slot for Babylon 5</H2>
30 Dec 1993<PRE>     The word that B5 will be on Sundays opposite Lois, SQ and others is
both unsubstantiated and untrue and has been retracted by the persons
posting that information.  In the majority of markets, it'll be on
Wednesdays at 8 p.m., though some stations will be showing it on other
days.
