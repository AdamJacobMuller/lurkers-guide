<H2>Re: Pilot Question? Religion?</H2>
14 Dec 1993<PRE>     Of course there are atheists in high command ranks; I was asked to
name those who had religions.  Atheism, despite what some say, is not a
religion.  As for the ambassadors...I didn't know what could really be
accomplished by naming their religions.  If I said -- as happens to be
true, as we'll seen in an ep called "By Any Means" -- that G'Kar is a
follower of G'Quan...what would that mean to anyone?

     (Computer glitch in the above...the title is "By Any Means
Necessary.")
