<H2>Pilot Question? Religion?</H2>
7 Dec 1993<PRE>     Religion is actually a fairly common topic in the B5 series; it's
in "By Any Means Necessary," "The Parliament of Dreams," and several other
episodes, sometimes subtly, sometimes as a main theme.  And we will be
dealing with cross-pollinization of religion across species and worlds,
and you will see some of the Centauri pantheon of gods.
