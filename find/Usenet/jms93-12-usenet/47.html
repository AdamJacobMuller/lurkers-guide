<H2>Re: Pilot Question? Religion?</H2>
14 Dec 1993<PRE>     I didn't say, and didn't intend to imply, that as you say, religion
CAUSES insane actions.  What it can do is to legitimize some actions, and
provoke others.  As an illustration of the former: the Bible was used to
justify everything from the Crusades to slavery.  Incorrectly, as many
believers are quick to point out today.  In the case of the latter: where
generally speaking rock'n'roll does not encourage you to believe that you
are being spoken to by supernatural beings, or that you were born sinful,
and those more weird albums that do get into this stuff are generally not
credible or recognized or legitimate...religion comes replete with devils
and gods and is given fair legitimacy by society.  If you have someone
with a fragile ego, someone who may be inclined toward hearing voices,
someone who is already a touch disturbed, such elements may contribute to
or exacerbate the problem.  Cause the problem?  No.  Contribute?  That's
another issue....
