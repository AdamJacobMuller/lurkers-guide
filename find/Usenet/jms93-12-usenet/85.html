<H2>Re: B5 FAQL / Minorities in B5</H2>
30 Dec 1993<PRE>     We're working on the variations within each race, not as throughly or
consistently as I'd like, but we're working on it.
 
     As for the commander...I could answer your question in more detail,
but I can't without blowing a lot of what's being prepared.  He isn't just
male by default, or by auctorial preference (though certainly I will be
putting in a lot of my own background into him, and into Garibaldi); there
is a very specific reason why he has to be male.  As for being caucasian,
we auditioned from every group looking for the right person who did the
best job in the audition.  He was the best for that part.  That's really
about as deep as it goes.  We were prepared to cast whowever walked in the
door and nailed the part.  That was Michael.
