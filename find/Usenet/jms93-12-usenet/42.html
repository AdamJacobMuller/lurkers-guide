<H2>Recreation in B5</H2>
11 Dec 1993<PRE>     Sports/recreation are things we're still trying to work out; not the
conceptual part, but the part about "okay, how do we SHOOT this?"  I'm
not big on "virtual reality" parlors or combat...I think people will still
be more interested in playing with real people than pixels.  So we're
trying to find ways we can visualize, in a TV series, things like zero-G
tag or football, other sports that use our unique space environment.  One
possibility is now being worked on, and we'll see if we can work it out
for this season.  In any event, it's definitely something we're thinking
about...I just don't want to rush into doing it until I know we can do it
properly.
