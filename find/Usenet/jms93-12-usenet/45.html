<H2>Re: Pilot Question? Religion?</H2>
13 Dec 1993<PRE>     How Orson Scott Card treats christians in his books, or how Marvel
comics does so, is a whole other discussion.  It's also something of a
distraction.  We're talking about TeeVee at the moment.  And what usually
happens in these discussions is what is happening here...bogus statistics
are thrown out, and then when challenged, people turn to smoke and turn
the discussion to other areas.  As for the Crusades...yes, christians did
a lot of killing in the name of religion.  One might not like that, but
that also happens to be history.  It happened.  Even today, some looney
or other gets it into his head that god told him to go up to the belltower
and start shooting at people.  People who commit suicide because they
think god told them to, or kill their families.  They are, however, the
minority; the properly classified Lunatic Fringe.  For the most part, we
seem to have evolved (if one can use that in a discussion of religion)
past organized activities to where only a few still pull this stuff.
 
     I have no problem with christians, or moslems, or any other group
provided that they don't attempt to circumvent my own rights, and disallow
my own views within my own group.  I have a number of friends who are
absolute, solid Born Agains.  One of them is one of the country's most
regarded cult-busters.  And we have *constant* go-arounds over the issues
of the day, from every possible perspective...a value, I think, in having
friends outside *SHOWBIZ*.  It keeps you in touch with views you don't
necessarily agree with.  Generally speaking, no one really changes the
other's beliefs, or lack thereof, but one does walk away with a better
understanding of the other positions involved.
 
     The one thing that all of my Born Again friends have in common is
that they haven't shuttered their critical faculties; they believe that
they were given the facility to think logically by god for a *reason*,
and they apply that reason in equal measure to their faith.  When one of
the apostles wanted to put his hand in Jesus's side to verify that he was
indeed up and walking around again, he wasn't told "No, forget it, just
take my word for it," he was allowed to do so.  Because reasoning is part
of what makes us who and what we are, and sets us above the beasts of the
field.  One of the greatest figures in the old testament is Solomon, who
was esteemed because of his *wisdom* as well as his faith.  He thought
things through in a logical, critical fashion, and came up with solutions.
 It's only uncritical thinking that I have a problem with.
 
     And what this has to do with Babylon 5 is anyone's guess....
