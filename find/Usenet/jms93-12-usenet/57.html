<H2>Re: Program Guides, something</H2>
21 Dec 1993<PRE>     I haven't yet heard the final disposition on the schedule for
airing; we'll have plenty done, enough to run them straight through, but I
don't know if PTEN will do that, or show new ones, then rerun a few, then
more new ones, as they did with the other PTEN shows.  When I do know, I'll
be sure to post the info.
