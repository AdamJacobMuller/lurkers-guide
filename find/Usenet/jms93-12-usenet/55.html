<H2>Tech manual?</H2>
19 Dec 1993<PRE>     Ron's chomping at the bit (actually, he's chomped THROUGH the bit)
to do a tech manual.  I wouldn't be surprised if there were one sooner or
later, if the series is as successful as hoped for, but it's still a bit
down the road.  As for merchandising...it's not so much that I'm against
it, I just don't want it to get in the way, and it *won't* get in the way.
 I won't allow it.  So I try to keep some measure of distance between me
and that stuff.  If a deal gets made, all that matters to me is that it's
done properly, and presented in continuity with the rest of the B5
universe.  Mainly, I don't want this to get out of control, or turn into
a "franchise."
