<H2>Re: Nitpick about pilot</H2>
28 Dec 1993<PRE>      On your point that B5 looks and feels and, arguably, *is* something
that humanity could build, is nominally within our grasp...this is
something that we've been building toward for a while, is part of what we
want to do with the show.  At a recent screening of some episodes for cast
and crew, the one most frequent comment I got afterward was that it *felt*
real, that this felt like how it might really be to work and live out on
the fringe.  Many SF futures are so far beyond our grasp as to enter the
realm of unattainable fantasy...I'd like to point to something as more
within our grasp, to remind us that we can do this, and that maybe we
SHOULD do this.
