<H2>Paintings in B5</H2>
26 Dec 1993<PRE>     The matte interior of the B5 garden was done very quickly, in a very
brief period of time, when the model we'd built of the Garden ended up
unsatisfactory.  We actually built a model of the thing, which was abou5
(about) 10-12 feet long, big enough to walk through, showing the circular
walls and garden...but it just didn't work for us.  So Ron quickly put
together the garden matte used in the pilot.
 
     We've re-done that, and I think it's better.  I think it works best
in some of the night scenes, as in the Fresh Air Restaurant you'll see in
"Born to the Purple" and other episodes, but it's better.  The only
problem that I still have with it is that we've used a slight haze to the
garden CGI/matte, since looking across about half a kilometer of open air
you'd *get* a haze like that, but for my tastes it kinda flattens it out
a bit, you lose the contrasts and kicks.  Others like it a lot.  It's
something we're still tweaking for best effect.
 
     The core shuttle, with its component CGI element, has been totally
redesigned.
