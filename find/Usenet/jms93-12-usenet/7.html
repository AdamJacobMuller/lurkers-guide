<H2>Re: Bab-5..Too good to be true</H2>
2 Dec 1993<PRE>     My feelings toward "Sky" haven't changed one iota; it's still got
things in it you've never seen before on television.  I put "Parliament"
and "Mind War" in front because the performances are just so wonderful,
so compelling...and from a selfish reason, because I think I did some of
the best writing I've ever done in those two episodes.  "Sky" remains an
absolutely compelling piece of work, and it's got some visuals that'll
just knock you out.  This is like asking a parent which is his favorite
child; it's not always the obvious choice, the biggest and strongest and
fastest; it's the one with the little quirks and eccentricities that he
likes the most.  Ditto here.
