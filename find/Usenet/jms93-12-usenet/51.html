<H2>Re: Pilot Question? Religion?</H2>
15 Dec 1993<PRE>      "Have you been dodging the question of what Foundationism is?"
 
      Of course I've been dodging it.  What I can say for now is that it
has nothing to do with Asimov other than an echo in the name; the nature
of Foundationism is separate and distinct, dealing with a spiritual
Foundation of a particular nature.  It's a new religion that has come up
in the time between the present and 2258.
