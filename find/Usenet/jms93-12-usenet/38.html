<H2>Re: Pilot Question? Religion?</H2>
10 Dec 1993<PRE>     I didn't mention other (non-Western) religions because that wasn't
what we were discussing at the moment.  But having said that...we do
plan on showcasing other religions (human) as well as western ones.
 
     If you don't see much of it on other TV, here's why: because those
who complain most that, in a country with freedom of religion, their
group (evangelicals) isn't portrayed enough then turn around and raise
absolute hell the moment ANY other religion is portrayed on TV in an
even remotely sympathetic fashion.  It took years for television to show
jews on TV; we're still working on the rest.  If you show a Moslem or a
Zen monk on TV, you get hate mail accusing you of advancing the cause of
satanism...similar letters go to networks and sponsors and studios.
 
     It's ironic that those who complain of persecution the loudest, ard
(are) generally the ones with the most power, and the quickest to
persecute someone else if it serves their purposes.
