3 Dec 1993<PRE>     Silvana Gallardo played Dr. Maya Hernandez in "Believers."
 
     We're actually using a fairly large number of Hispanic actors in the
series, along with other groups.  Just cast an actor named Jose Rey as a
character named Eduardo Delvientos, as well as a great number of asians
and african americans as senators, advisors, doctors, and so on.
 
     It's been my belief, and I'll say it again, that if we go to the
stars at all, we're ALL going...or no one's going.  We've got to get past
this crap.
 
     Kosh's voice is done by an actor, overlaid on musical notes which
are Kosh's natural voice-tones.  (We hear the English via translator
device.)
 
     The February Cinefantastique will have a cover story on the B5 series.
 
     There are a number of major magazines planning B5 stuff, but it's
premature to announce them at this time.
