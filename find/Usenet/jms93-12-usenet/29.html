<H2>Alright, another tiny question</H2>
8 Dec 1993<PRE>     Okay, okay, 8 days not four...I knew it weren't no 3 weeks, though.
The one thing to remember is that travel in hyperspace isn't the main
problem; the real problem, time-wise, is the period required to get from
a world to its nearest jump gate.  It might take 4 days to travel from
World X to the gate, and 1 day to B5 in hyperspace...while another race,
1 day from the gate, and 1 day to B5 in hyperspace, only has 2 travel
days.
