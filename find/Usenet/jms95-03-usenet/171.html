<H2>JMS: How'd you meet Harlan?</H2>
23 Mar 1995<PRE>     No, I wasn't involved with "Paladin" or the CBS version of TZ except
to write one episode (I story edited the syndicated version).  I actually
met Harlan for the first time on a Writer's Guild picket line outside CBS
a couple/three years before.  Just exchanged a few words, that's about it.
