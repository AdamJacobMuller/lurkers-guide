<H2>"New Age" jms?  &gt;:-)&gt;</H2>
19 Mar 1995<PRE>     I take great pains to a) treat religion with respect while b) not
advancing any one specific creed or belief in the process.  I've been
accused (in this forum) of advancing the cause of Judaism; now I'm told
I'm advancing New Age philosophy; I've heard other opinions.
 
     I have no interest in doing *any* of these things, and anyone who
perceives an agenda where none exists may be extrapolating from their
OWN personal beliefs and agendas.
 
                                                                 jms
