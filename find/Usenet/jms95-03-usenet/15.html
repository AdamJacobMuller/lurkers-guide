<H2>JMS: Writer's strike?</H2>
3 Mar 1995<PRE>     Since negotiations between the WGA and the Alliance companies seem
to be going along well just now, and since the WGA only renegotiates
every four-five years, so the next one wouldn't be until B5 had run its
full course, the question seems to me moot in any event.
