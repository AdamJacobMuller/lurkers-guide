<H2>Attn:JMS- UK order of shows.</H2>
22 Mar 1995<PRE>     Originally, "Soul Mates" was intended to be broadcast after "A Race
Through Dark Places."  ARTDP required a rather substantial amount of
post production work and audio design; "Mates" did not.  Rather than
rush "Race," we decided it was okay to air those two in reverse order.
If they have aired with "Race" first in the UK, then yes, it's different
than the US order, but it *is* the correct production and story order.
