<H2>ATTN JMS: UK B5 group</H2>
4 Mar 1995<PRE>     I can basically handle one big group on internet at a time; when
rec.arts.b5 was created, I moved here from alt.b5 and haven't been on it
since.  (Also, my access to internet is via a gateway created by another
kind user that I can use via GEnie; I don't directly get into internet.)
So my guess is probably not, barring anything extraordinary.
