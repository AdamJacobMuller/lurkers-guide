<H2>Spoiling Vorlons for JMS</H2>
30 Mar 1995<PRE>     I've never been overly worried about Kosh, because though some have
strayed near, no one has entirely *got it*, so it's cool.  There have been
one or two stories, small ones, that yes, have been scuttled because
they've been suggested here, but not too much.  Basically, if I were to
keep changing directions every time somebody makes a guess, I'd be all over
the landscape.  You can't tell a story that way.
