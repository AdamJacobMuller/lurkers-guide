<H2>Attn JMS:Babylon 5 Competition</H2>
19 Mar 1995<PRE>     Okay, if you really want my opinions....
 
     DS9....what I've seen of it just puts me to sleep.
 
     Voyager...good characters, potentially interesting situation, hasn't
been pushed enough; falling back on the tried and true when, after this
many Treks, it really has to go balls to the wall.
 
     seaQuest...great potential, wasted.
 
     VR5...interesting possibilities, waiting to see what they do with
it.
 
     X-Files...absolutely terrific.  In my office in the B5 studio, I have
one mug.  It's not a B5 mug.  It's an X-files mug.
