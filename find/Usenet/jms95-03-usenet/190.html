<H2>JMS: what merchandise has been</H2>
29 Mar 1995<PRE>     Thus far, there are licensed caps, shirts, a soundtrack, an LCD game,
Micromachines, the comic, the novels from Dell...and soon to come, trading
cards, a screen saver and some other stuff.  The most common illegal stuff
tends to be fake Links, patches, pins, PPGs, Starfuries and boarding
passes.  None of this has been licensed, so if you see it, it ain't legit.
 
     I think this should stay within the purview of the fans, rather than
sending us constant notification of this.  I don't want people to feel
obligated to rat this stuff out; that's our problem.  Don't support it,
but I refuse to turn enjoyable con weekends into exercises in Big
Brotherism.
