<H2>Re: Yo Theron</H2>
12 Mar 1995<PRE>     Deborah (assuming this really is you and not Theron logging on under
another name to get some sympathy)...I'm sorry but you fail the test of
logic on just about every conceivable level.  By your lights, it's okay to
smear people's reputations, announce that people are not to be trusted,
imply that they are liars, all that's fine as long as one doesn't use bad
words.  What a wonderfully convenient and perverse world you live in.
 
     You look around and say, well, gee, Joe hasn't produced the ratings,
maybe something's wrong, why are they being withheld, maybe the whole
truth isn't being told...you want to know the details, and demand that I
provide them to you.
 
     First Deb (or whoever)...screw off.  I don't have to provide you with
zip.  You say you work at a campus, you're a student.  Allow me to introudce
you to the concept of "research."  This isn't top secret classified
material; this is the most easily accessible information on the planet.
Every week DAILY VARIETY and the HOLLYWOOD REPORTER list ratings for the
syndicated and network shows (and yes, they ARE considered two separate
things, as anyone who bothered to do the LEAST amount of digging into the
question instead of relying on the person they're smearing and badrapping
to provide it for them because they ask for it, like it's some kind of
holy obligation).  You wanna know the ratings?  Come our next batch of
new episodes, why don't you just drag your smarmy, accusatory, "you know
you really can't trust him, he's a producer, oh, we won't call him a liar,
but we'll just whisper it" ass down to the campus library and LOOK IT UP.
 
     "...one producer who goes only by his initials...."
 
     Excuse me, but what the hell does THAT bit of smear-tactic mean when
my name is right on top of every single damned message I post?  Do you mean
that after all this time you -- gasp! -- don't know WHO I AM?  You mean you
see "only" some initials on the bottom of a message and you're so confused
by who this might be that you've fallen down the dark, dusty staircase you
call your cerebullum and now can't get up?  Good heavens, I've had an
alias all this time and I haven't known it!  I'm a stealth producer!  No
one knows who I am, just those....INITIALS!  Suddenly I feel like the
Batman.
 
     In addition, I *have* posted the specific ratings on many occasions,
here and elsewhere.  For the last week on Compuserve (verifiable by many
here who are also on CIS, since after all I'm a producer and can't really
be trusted to say anything honest about the business) I posted the ratings
for various areas of the country, including share, and how the general
overall ratings have increased.  Probably sooner or later that stuff will
be reposted here, because it always is.
 
     You and Theron (unless you are one and the same) have this nutty
notion that you can ask anything you want, be as accusative and slanderous
as you want, but that's okay...and if *everything* you want and ask for
isn't provided INSTANTLY, in excruciating detail...well, then, my goodness
something's WRONG, isn't it?
 
     Re: my veracity, you say, "I'd be wary and seek a second opinion or
read very carefully to see what info isn't being said."
 
     And because something isn't being said, you thererfore assume that
something's wrong, being held back.  And what precise second opinion did
you have in mind?  Perhaps the PUBLISHED TRADES I commended to you a
moment ago?
 
     Enough.  Enough of you, and your father/alter ego; enough of your
smears, and your oh-so-carefully-phrased-not-to-use-bad-words, let's jsut
call him a liar *quietly*, and your lurking on the back fence as we have
a decent conversation, adding nothing but a murmuring, soft voice that
mewls "don't trust him, don't trust him"...at whom somebody ought to toss
an old shoe.
 
     I'm not going to do your damned homework for you, Deborah, do it
yourself.  And if you've got ANYTHING to say, ANY proof that what I've
said here is anything other than what's been posted, you or that
homunculus Theron should speak up or shut up.  Every time we get a nice,
pleasant, friendly atmosphere going here, and a good conversation, you two
poster children for co-dependency swoop in here and piss all over th
place.
 
     Get a clue or get out.  I've had it with both of you.
 
                                                                   jms
