<H2>JMS: ab fab</H2>
31 Mar 1995<PRE>     Is this the New York portion of AbFab?  Is it as good as the rest?  I
wondered if they were going to take the edge off because of the American
connection.
 
     (Sadly, I will have to deny every being a fan of AbFab the day the
Roseanne Barr version hits TV.)
