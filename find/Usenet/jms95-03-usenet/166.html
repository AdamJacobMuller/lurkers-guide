<H2>ATTN: JMS do you ever get frea</H2>
23 Mar 1995<PRE>     "Do you ever think, `My god, what have I started?'"
 
     Who has time?  (And why does this make me think of a Talking Heads
song?)
 
     The job of a story is to be seen by others.  If no one ever sees it
it does not fulfill its purpose.  I generally don't really look at this
as personal approbation, rather as a sense that the story has been seen,
and it's good enough that people enjoy discussing it and arguing over it
and debating it.  Which is the point: to initiate discussion.  If it does
that, than I can't be anything other than deleriously happy.
