<H2>B5 T-Shirt and Cap Info (jms)</H2>
4 Mar 1995<PRE>     In reply to the many who've asked...All-U, which has one of hte
licenses for B5 merchandise, has been supplying mainly to distributers
but has now started taking individual orders.  These are *truly* nifty
t-shirts and caps, authorized and approved.  There are t-shirts (short
AND long-sleeve) for the cast with station, station with B5 logo and
the words "the last best hope," station/logo/planet, and station with a
starfury in foreground.  The cap has the B5 logo embroidered.  These
are quality shirts, folks.  When these guys grabbed the license, and
we saw how good they were, we ordered boxes and boxes of 'em for the
studio, and these are the exact same ones worn by many of our crew and
cast.  The artwork is laid down nicely, not heavy, well detailed, and
true to the look of the show.
 
     Orders can be placed at All-U at 1-800-424-2558, ext. 105.  Shirts
and caps are $17, with long-sleeve shirts at $25, plus shipping.  As I've
noted before, we're doing limited merchandising, mainly that which can be
controlled for quality and done right.  These definitely qualify.
