<H2>Re: TNG v Bab 5</H2>
19 Mar 1995<PRE>     Y'know, this discussion is as essentially dopey as "Which would win
in a fight, Superman or Mighty Mouse?"
 
     (And, of course, this whole "who would win?" go-round is dependent
upon the notion that this would take place during that one fraction of a
second in which the crew hasn't been turned into children, or the
dilithium crystals haven't decayed, or the ship's got a skeleton crew and
is running on automation, or the holodeck's taken command of the ship,
or...well, you get the idea.)
 
                                                                  jms
