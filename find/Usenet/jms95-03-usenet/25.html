<H2>Attn JMS: What's with Warner's</H2>
4 Mar 1995<PRE>     I think to some extent we're falling between two chairs, given that
most of Warner's attention now is in promoting the WB network.  It's
been the topic of...considerable discussion lately, and with any kind of
luck at all, we might get a bit more PR down the road.
