<H2>ATTN JMS: Totally Unrelated to</H2>
24 Mar 1995<PRE>     (If one longs to have a book like Elfquest, does that make one guilty
of Pini envy?)
 
     The Pinis indicated they don't want synopses uploaded, so that's out,
and my memory isn't what it used to be, if it ever was.  What I *do*
remember is that we tried to keep the new stories in line with what had
gone before, and were going into an overall story that would complement
what was being done in the comics.  I vaguely recall that it involved some
members of the Holt disappearing, and a quest being launched to find them.
 
     We kept the characters the same as in the books, the language, the
maturity...which is why the Pinis loved it...and which is why CBS finally
passed.
