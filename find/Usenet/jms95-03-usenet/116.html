15 Mar 1995<PRE>     I will admit that I am now confused.  I received a letter from Ms.
Barnes in private mail asking about charges of harrassment.  I received
a second message from John Ford copying his response to Ms. Barnes re:
charges of harrassment.  Now she says charges haven't been filed.  I
have absolutely no understanding of what's going on, I only passed along
what had been sent to me.  Perhaps John can further illuminate this.  I
will confess to being an Internet newbie, and thus sometimes easily
confused by the system and its parts and pieces, but this seemed to me
very straightforward.
