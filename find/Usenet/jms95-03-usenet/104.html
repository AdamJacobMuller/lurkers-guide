<H2>ATTN JMS: Will you write one n</H2>
15 Mar 1995<PRE>     A detailed novel down the road, when the series is finished, is
certainly a possibility...but right now, tired as I am, nearing the end
of this season, it sounds about as appealing as a high colonic.  I also
think sometimes that if I do my job right, there shouldn't be the need
for books later; on the other hand, there's mounds of stuff I've never
used from my notes.
