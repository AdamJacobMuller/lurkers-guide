<H2>ATTN: JMS - What's wrong with</H2>
14 Mar 1995<PRE>     I just didn't *buy* n'grath.  He looked cool, but did he look
SENTIENT?  That's the next level that I don't think has been reached yet;
I think we're on the right track, but I can't ever dare settle for less
than being a perfectionist.  That means being more critical than the
audience in some cases.
