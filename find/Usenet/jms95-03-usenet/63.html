10 Mar 1995<PRE>     "...tips on being a technomage."
 
     Real technomages don't need tips.  They simply Are.
 
     General advice would be...never eat anything bigger than your head,
never shoot pool at a place called Pop's, never eat food at a place
called Mom's, the difference between horses and humans is that they're
too smart to bet on what *we'll* do...and a fool and his money were
lucky to get together in the first place.
 
     That'll be one dollar.
