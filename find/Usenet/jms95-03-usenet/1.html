<H2>Viewers for Quality TV for B5</H2>
1 Mar 1995<PRE>     I'm *very* pleased to announce that the latest survey by Viewers For
Quality Television (VQT) has selected BABYLON 5 as the #1 ranked
syndicated drama, and #16 *overall*, putting it ahead of such series as
MURPHY BROWN, DS9, SEINFELD, DR. QUINN MEDICINE WOMAN and THE SIMPSONS
in their listings for Highest Quality Shows.
 
     My thanks and appreciation to all those who took the time to seek out
VQT's surveys, and continue to do so, in order to bring attention to the
hard work being done on this show, and it is our hope that we continue to
merit your attention and support.
 
                                                                     jms
