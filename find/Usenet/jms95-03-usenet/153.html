<H2>Re: "New Age" jms?  &gt;:-)&gt;</H2>
22 Mar 1995<PRE>     There is considerable historical evidence that crucifixion was
practiced as a means of punishment by the Romans toward the Jews at the
time in question (though the methodology varied considerably from some
of the accounts; a nail driven through the hand would be torn off fairly
quickly by the weight of the body; ropes were commonly used as the main
support, with spikes for...emphasis).  Certainly one can infer, even from
the limited evidence, that someone bearing this name was indeed
nailed up.  Whether he was a deity or simply a very good man with some
very good ideas which have gotten somewhat distorted in places...is kind
of the essential question.  I tend to go with the latter.  But that's
just me.
