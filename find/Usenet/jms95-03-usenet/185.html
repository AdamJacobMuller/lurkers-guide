<H2>Babylon Squared: Who are we fi</H2>
28 Mar 1995<PRE>      Robert Lynn Rhodes: in return for your good post, here's a gift:
while we won't see Zathras this season, we will HEAR his name, but not
from anyone who was on B4.  He's around, but he's not *here*.
 
                                                                    jms
