<H2>ATTN JMS Kosh 'n' Zen</H2>
8 Mar 1995<PRE>     We have a number of variable sounds we can use to create Kosh's

     Re: Zen...I find it an interesting approach, though I don't put that
much more stock in it per se than any other system.  It applies an
intriguing way of seeing the world, and I enjoy many elements about it,
so I use it for story stuff or characterization sometimes, just as I draw
on other areas.
