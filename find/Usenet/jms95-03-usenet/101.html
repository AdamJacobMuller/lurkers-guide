<H2>Re: Great Flame!</H2>
14 Mar 1995<PRE>     It is now 3:10 a.m.  I am now leaving my GEnie gateway to Internet
with about 150 as yet unread messages, mostly "flame" and "yo theron" in
nature.  I'll do a quick run on a couple of other systems, then crash
around 4-4:30 a.m., to get up at 8 a.m. for meetings tomorrow.  Just so
everyone knows my schedule.
 
     I've just gotten a note from someone quoting Ms. Fuller on another
service in which she again threatens to "write to Warner Bros., and let
them know what their representative is doing with their time and money."
  She concludes, "That kind of behavior needs to be stopped, period."
 
     John Ford can verify this if he chooses to do so.
 
     It's apparent that we do not all play by the same rules here.  You
and I and the rest of us rely on the arguments we pose.  Some here run to
complain to various authorities because "this kind of behavior," being a
free exchange, "needs to be stopped, period."  They can't win the
argument, so they go whining off to somebody to beat up on the person
they're arguing with.
 
     Cowardice, plain and simple.
 
     Maybe it's because it's now 3:14 a.m., and I'm tired, and this is
bullshit, and I've seen 1/3rd of the messages in my mailbox (and yours)
given over to this, but this has gotten sick and ugly and senseless.
 
     Henceforth, I will not respond to *any* messages from either Fuller,
father or daughter.  I will no longer give their sad, pathetic lives the
satisfaction and validation of a response.  Which is clearly what they
most dearly want, and most profoundly cherish.  To feel persecuted, to
be the center of attention, to pretend to be the wounded soul up upon the
cross.
 
     But at least Christ died quietly and didn't go running off to the
Pharisees to complain.  If one is going to wear the cloth of the martyr,
one should play the part to the hilt.
 
     This is the last message I will write in this thread.  Nor will I
read any more in this thread.  I suggest one clear path of action to
everyone here:
 
     Ignore them.  Don't respond.  Ms. Fuller said this "needs to be
stopped."  Okay, fine...let's stop it our way.  Ignore them to death.
 
     It's the only way to make them go.
 
     Granted, some of you will ignore reason (as I did), but suffice to
say, I'm saddened and sickened and dismayed by this, and let them lie to
their heart's content.  This is the kind of behavior that makes me
question frankly the wisdom in being here.  At least at 3:20 am, when
this stuff grates on me the most.
 
     Everybody out of the pool.  Somebody's pissed in the water and
made it uncomfortable for everybody else.
 
     Either way...I'm outta this thread.  Let the cowards and the
crybabies yell into a vacuum.  I really don't give a shit anymore.
 
     I'm tired.
 
                                            jms (3:20 a.m.)
