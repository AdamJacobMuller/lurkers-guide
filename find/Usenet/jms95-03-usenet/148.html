<H2>ATTN: JMS:  Do you watch the s</H2>
20 Mar 1995<PRE>     I always watch the show when it's first broadcast, and usually in
the reruns if I happen to be home, to make sure the audio and video
aspects are still correct (and someday that'll happen).  As I "am"
Babylonian Prods. (co-owner with Doug), I get copies of the tapes
automatically, and as a terrible act of self-sacrifice, I've volunteered
to receive the first set of pre-release laserdisks to check them out,
do all the usual quality control.  When they come out for real, I'll
probably buy a set.
