<H2>Re: JMS: Influence</H2>
22 Mar 1995<PRE>     I repeat and stand by my original message: I have never asked anyoned
(anyone) to go after anyone else here.  You (Jim Shupe) cite the Cynthia
message, but that was a request for *support* in what looked like a bad
situation coming; there was NO request for anyone to flame anybody in my
message.  You're comparing apples and oranges.
 
     "would you use such language directed at a person in front of a group
of 1st graders?"
 
     Probably not.  But the people assembled here aren't first graders.
First graders aren't on the nets.  First graders can't read generally.  So
why should I limit my language and information and messages to the first
grade level?
 
     Sounds like lowest common denominator programming to me.
 
     I understand your concerns, Jim, but the minute this forum turns into
a medium for free and untrammeled exchanges for everyone EXCEPT me, I'm
outta here.
 
                                                                    jms
