8 Mar 1995<PRE>     Ratings tell you how many people are watching.  Demographics tell
you what *sorts* of people are watching...age, income, sex, that sort of
thing.  The advertisers like to reach people who spend money, preferably
on their products.  You can have a highly rated show, but if (to indulge
for a moment in the crass-think exercised by ad people) that audience
consists mainly of people in their 70s and above...it's hard to GIVE away
the ads.  You can be a lower rated show, but if you can deliver within the
desired demographics, the advertisers will come to you.
 
     The B5 demographics are absolutely dynamite, and that's *very* good
for us.  We get a lot of people in the 18-49 range, our largest share of
viewers, mostly educated, good consumers.  They die for that kind of
viewership.
 
     Translation: they've seen who YOU guys are...and they like what they
see.  Well, maybe except for that one guy in the loud Hawaiian shirt over
there in the third row....
