<H2>Re: B5 is a surreal farce!</H2>
14 Mar 1995<PRE>     Red Dwarf is one of the gaps in my SF education; I've caught bits and
pieces of the show, enough to enjoy it, but not enough to really get a
feel for the show.  Also, there's a certain kind of British humor that
doesn't work for me as well as others; The Young Ones (I think that's the
name) leaves me only marginally amused while Fawlty Towers or AbFab will
put me on the floor in minutes.  Red Dwarf (what I've seen of it) tends to
fall into the former category; don't know why, really.
