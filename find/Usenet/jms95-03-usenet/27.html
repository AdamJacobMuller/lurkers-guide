<H2>JMS: G's bubbles (H,P spoilers</H2>
5 Mar 1995<PRE>      P.S.  For folks who, as you indicated, like to freeze-frame this
stuff and look at it later, I slipped in a little something JUST for you
guys (and, well, yeah, it also serves a plot point, and pushes part of
the arc), but it's something the freeze-framers will enjoy...look for it
in the first couple of episodes in the next batch of new episodes.
