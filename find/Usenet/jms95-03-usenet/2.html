<H2>Attn.: JMS: Observation on Dia</H2>
2 Mar 1995<PRE>     All audio tracks are made very clear when they leave our hands; at
various points along the way, our audio generally gets messed with, losing
the dynamic range and having the midrange stuff hammered; this is done by
some stations and the satellite folks, so that may account for some of
what you're experiencing.
