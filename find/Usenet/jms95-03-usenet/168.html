<H2>"New Age" jms?  &gt;:-)&gt;</H2>
23 Mar 1995<PRE>     Here's the irony in this whole discussion: one of the friendly crew
members on B5 named Eric came up to me at lunch and said, paraphrasing
from memory, "I really want to thank you for what's in the show, the last
few in particular [stuff that won't air until the next batch]; I'm a
Christian too, and it's good to see someone else who believes the same
way actually getting good christian messages out there about prayer and
faith."
 
     At which point I gently explained that I was an atheist...and he just
kinda looked at me, as if I'd just grown three heads and feathers.  Later,
he stopped by my office, citing another line used in the show before and
echoed again in something we'd just shot ("You should be careful what you
ask for, because sometimes the universe listens") and repeated his initial
thesis, perhaps in the belief that this time I'd cop to being a christian.
Nope.  But we've had some good conversations about it.
 
                                                                     jms
