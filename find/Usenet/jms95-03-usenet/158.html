<H2>ATTN: JMS Re: "The Great Maker</H2>
22 Mar 1995<PRE>     It's very hard to just sit back and enjoy the show.  I'm always
looking at it critically....what did we do right, what did we do wrong,
is this the best angle *really*, should this music cue have started five
frames sooner, why is there a little glitch in the doorframe behind the
character, why did I write "the" instead of "a," what can I learn from
this to apply toward future shows...you can go mad.
 
     In general, I have to watch an episode (after it's finished) ten to
fifteen times minimum before I can actually *see* it as a whole, more or
less as a viewer.  Which means it often takes a couple-three years before
I can truly appreciate it.
 
     (This is true of just about anything I write for TV, btw.)
