<H2>Re: Loved your Debra/Thoron ra</H2>
15 Mar 1995<PRE>     I'm posting this here because this conversation has just gotten
even uglier, and I felt this should be mentioned right now as it's
happening.
 
     I have today received two pieces of email indicating that, in
addition to threatening to write to Warner Bros. to try and shut me up,
Deborah Fuller has now contacted her university administration on the
premise that my comments to here in all of my public messages (I have
never sent her private mail) constitute sexual harrassment.  She is
apparently hoping to use the university as leverage in bringing a
complaint against Warner Bros., or suing, or who knows what.
 
     (My suspicion is that she's using the message in which I tell her
to drag her ass down to the library and look up the ratings herself as
the incident of sexual harrassment.)
 
     She seems determined to exercise every untruthful tactic to try and
destory this conversation by forcing me to withdraw, by direct complaint
to the studio, to her university, whatever it takes.
 
     Apparently the person to whom the complaint has been filed at the
university is Cynthia Barnes, CBARNES@SWAN.ADMIN.UIUC.EDU.  All of my
messages to either Fuller have been here, in full view of everyone.  If
anyone here would like to write a note telling this person what you've
seen, this would be terrific.
 
     I've been on the nets since 1985.  This is probably the lowest
thing I have ever seen, the lowest tactic I have ever seen, to try and
kill the messenger in a debate that one is losing.
 
                                                                 jms
