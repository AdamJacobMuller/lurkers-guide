<H2>JMS: Murder, She Wrote</H2>
10 Mar 1995<PRE>     Hrmm...I'm going to try and do this from memory, and it was a while
back..."Incident in Lot #7," "To The Last Will I Grapple With Thee" (the
winner for the longest MSW title on record), "The Wind Around the
Tower," "The Committee," one about a well-known actor returning to appear
in a play in Cabot Cove whose former manager is murdered (I've forgotten
the title), "Lines of Excellence," and several others.
 
                                                                     jms
 
     (I think they're playing stuff from my tenure on USA now, in fact.)
