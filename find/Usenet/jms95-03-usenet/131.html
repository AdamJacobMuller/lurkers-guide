<H2>ATTN JMS: Bruce not going? VUL</H2>
18 Mar 1995<PRE>     Actually, this is the first time I've heard of this.  I don't often
go into convention stuff with the cast.  So I really don't quite know what
to say; I'll delicately inquire, but I honestly do try and stay out of
stuff the actors do outside work per se, because it's intrusive, and any
suggestions or reactions sometimes carry more weight than they should
because they come from one's exec producer.
