<H2>Does the title sequence keep c</H2>
16 Mar 1995<PRE>     Yes, there were a series of continuing modifications to the main title
sequence throughout the first third or so of the new second season
episodes.  My sense is that just because it's being broadcast is no reason
to just drop it if you're not ecstatic.  I wasn't; I felt some things could
still be improved, whether or not anyone else ever noticed.  We also did
revisions to reflect changes in the show, moving Ivanova and Keffer up in
rank, for instance.
