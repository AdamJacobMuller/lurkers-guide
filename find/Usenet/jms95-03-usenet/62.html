<H2>ATTN JMS: Vorlon influence?</H2>
10 Mar 1995<PRE>     I've never been able to work up enough steam to read "Lathe."  I've
read some of Ursula's work, but have often enough found it slow going that
I just kinda ran out of enthusiasm.  It's on my "when you have time, read
this" list.
 
     In terms of writers now...I can't think of that much being done now
in SF that really moves me or grabs me on a visceral level; not so much
because it ain't there, because it probably is, only that since jumping
onto B5 I've had *very* little time to read much of ANYthing.  Most of what
I do read seems to end up in other genres...lots of nonfiction, some dark
or contemporary fantasy.  (I've noticed this trend before; if I'm doing a
humor-oriented show, I won't watch or read anything comedic...if I'm doing
a mystery, I'll avoid mysteries...don't know why, really.)
 
     I'd definitely recommend Neil Gaiman, one of the best writers out
there right now in any area.  Terry Pratchett.  And Jonathan Carroll,
without question.  He doesn't have quite the cachet of a Stephen King or
a Jorge Luis Borges, but believe me, they'll be looking back at this guy
for years to come, he's *that* good.  Harlan keeps telling me to read
Poppy Z. Brite, and one of these days I'll get around to it.
 
                                                                       jms
