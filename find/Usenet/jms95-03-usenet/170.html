<H2>Religion Threads</H2>
23 Mar 1995<PRE>     What I find vastly rewarding is the fact that in general, religion
is one of those things that you either don't discuss on boards, or you
get into vast, massive, heated and vituperative flame wars that make
Carthage look like a tea party.  But here, in general, the topic has been
able to be discussed and different views aired in a non-accusative
fashion...not argued, but *discussed*, which I think is nifty.
