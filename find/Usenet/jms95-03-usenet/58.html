<H2>ATTN JMS: DiTillio!  Ragnarok-</H2>
9 Mar 1995<PRE>     We had a war going there for a while (Larry and I would occasionally
declare war on one another for no particular reason).  Larry named a bald
butler in one of his episodes for another show "Straczynski."  So I
countered with the twisted dwarf named DiTillio in one of my episodes for
TRGBs.  He then came back at me with a deranged magician named The Amazing
Straczynski in another episode.  Then Marc Zicree got Larry, me, AND
dragged Kathryn into it in "Lights"...at which point, having been
blindsided, we decided it wasn't worth doing anymore and looked for other,
more productive means of warfare.
