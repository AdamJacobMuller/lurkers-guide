<H2>ATTN JMS: How Do You Pitch a S</H2>
3 Mar 1995<PRE>     I operate off the notion that a network or studio has the right to
know what they're buying, and that I shouldn't go into an office to sell
a series (B5 or otherwise) unless I know where it's going, to one extent
or another.  Hence, all series projects I do, I pitch with a series bible,
multiple episode synopses, a sample script, and artwork if necessary to
convey the concept.  I'm a one man traveling road show.
