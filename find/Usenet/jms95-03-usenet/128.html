<H2>RATINGS RATINGS RATINGS RATING</H2>
16 Mar 1995<PRE>     Ratings always fluctuate from week to week; but in general we're
between the two figures you cite, 4.6 and 5.0 or 5.1, which is up overall
from last season, where we tended to average a 4.1 or 4.3.  There is a
constant, slow growth as the show gains viewers mainly through word of
mouth.
 
     The fundamental issue here boils down to one very basic fact: PTEN
gets the ratings.  If the ratings are good, we'll be renewed.  If the
ratings are not, we won't.  Simple as that.
 
     Last season at this time, I put the odds of renewal at about 50/50.
And I encouraged viewers to write their stations and Warner Bros. the
closer we got to pickup.  Right now, I'd place the odds at 70/30, which
is very good.  I am cautiously optimistic; sometimes shows can get
canceled for the damndest reasons, and you never really know which way
the blade is going to cut...nonetheless, I think we're okay, which is
why I haven't gone out of my way to urge a lot of letters or email.  You
only want to call out that kind of support occasionally, if and when
really needed, otherwise it becomes trivialized by over-use.  You
should only impose rarely.
 
     We'll know our fate for year three by the end of April.
