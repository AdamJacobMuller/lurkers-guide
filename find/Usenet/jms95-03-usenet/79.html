<H2>ATTN:Jms When it`s all over</H2>
11 Mar 1995<PRE>     Well...the most honest and straightforward answer I can give you is
that I don't know.  On one level, being online is a lot like being in the
mob; the only way you get out is feet first.  ("Every time I think I'm out
they pull me back in!" -- Godfather 3.)  On the other...if B5 does go its
full measure, I'll almost certainly bail out of TV, which kinda concludes
the experiment.  I'm also painfully (literally) cognizant of the impact of
the CTS which generally makes each night difficult for me after hours and
hours of typing, and I think I would rather cut back at that time on BBSing
and put it into writing if my typing eventually gets curtailed.
 
     (General notice...I've seen just about every article, message and
document on carpal tunnel syndrome; the last thing this forum needs is to
get filled with more messages on the subject.  Pretend you've sent it, and
I'll be fictionally grateful, and we'll both save a lot of time and
cyberspace.)
 
      And yes, I'm wearing the gloves; have had them on non-stop for the
last couple days, including at the office, since I'm blasting through the
last four scripts for this season nominally all at once, since they have
many thematic connections that work better if I write 'em together.
 
      So anyway...I don't know.  I'll probably always be around, to one
extent or another, responding at age 80 to somebody's question about just
what DID Harlan Ellison do on my show before he won the Nobel Prize...?
