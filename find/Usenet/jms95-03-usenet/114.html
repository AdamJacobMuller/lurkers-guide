<H2>Re: Loved your Debra/Thoron ra</H2>
15 Mar 1995<PRE>     I'm told that Cynthia has now received quite a few responses, and
thus no more may be required at this time so anyone else may want to
hold off.
 
     As an aside, in another message I glimpsed a question about direct
response to email from the Fullers not being answered...even though I do
not have a killfile, I do have to log onto GEnie at 2400 baud because
that's the line they provide for gratis accounts.  At 2400, I can see
the address before I see the message.  Thus any time I see that it is
from either Fuller, I simply hit ESC and delete the message unread.  I
will continue to do this with any message written by either of them.
 
                                                                  jms
