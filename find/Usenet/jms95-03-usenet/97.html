<H2>Re: Yo Theron</H2>
14 Mar 1995<PRE>     Flat out, Deborah-Who-Threatens-To-Complain-To-Warner-Bros., every
single message with my name on it is written by me.  You're right; the
way to do it is cut down on sleep and food during the week, which is what
I do.  Because unlike those who only come in here to foul the nest, I
happen to actually care about this dialogue.
 
     Now, I've said it, straight up.  Either I'm flat-out lying or I'm
not.  And y'know, I don't really give a damn what you think.  And my
reaction should someone mention "the fullers" I can tell you now, and
save you the imagining.
 
     "Who?"
