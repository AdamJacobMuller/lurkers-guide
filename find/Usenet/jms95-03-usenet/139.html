<H2>Re: "New Age" jms?  &gt;:-)&gt;</H2>
19 Mar 1995<PRE>     Basically, the term New Age has been adopted as an appellation used
by some of the fundamentalist right to describe anything they don't happen
to agree with.  And you're correct; much of what is *packaged* as New AGe
is primarily stuff cobbled up from older beliefs; similarly, there's a
lot of early Judao/Christian theology that's cobbled up from Zoroastrian
and Roman and Greek myths as well.  Everything's tied to everything else.
