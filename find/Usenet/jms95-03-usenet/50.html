<H2>Question about Bab5 production</H2>
8 Mar 1995<PRE>     Sometimes for production reasons, a section of dialogue may be looped
(a glitch in recording, off-camera noise, a faulty radio mike, any number
of common occurances).  We match the looped dialogue to the original with
proper room tone...and you can't easily tell it was done.  But we've known
for some time that our audio is getting crunched via the WB delivery
process, and some stations which cut out the dynamic range, particularly
those broadcasting in mono.  After all that, the differences can become
noticeable.
