<H2>Re: Can we get rid of imperial</H2>
8 Mar 1995<PRE>      And by the way...those who keep saying we should be showing metric
in the future...hey, I've *seen* the future, and metric was dropped in
2181 in favor of the original system, mainly to annoy the hell out of the
French.
 
      So *there*.
 
      And if it doesn't happen in 2181, you can come correct me.
 
      If you can find me.
