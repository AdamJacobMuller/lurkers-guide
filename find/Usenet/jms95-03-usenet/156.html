<H2>Quickies from JMS</H2>
22 Mar 1995<PRE>     As I write this we are now just under one month away from finishing
filming on year two.  Last day of shooting is April 20th.  I have now
written 14.5 episodes out of 22, and should have the very last script
for this season (#15 for me personally) done by late next week.  By the
end of April we should know whether or not we have been renewed.  We are
now hip deep in pursuing that goal.
 
     This time of season is much akin to that moment in "The Pit and the
Pendulum" where the swinging blade is about 1/15th of an inch from the
chest of our unwitting protagonist, and the rats are chewing at his bonds,
and there's some small debate about which set of teeth is going to hit
flesh first.
 
     Consequently...for the next 30 days, you might find me more than
usually intemperate.  More bluntly, expect to find me tired, irritable
and generally, garden-variety cranky.  I'm getting 3-4 hours sleep per
night, and upon arriving at the B5 offices I look rather like a death row
inmate walking the last mile...which is about the standard look on anyone
running a show this time of year.
 
     I will continue to try and moderate my replies, but if an unintended
edge creeps into the phosphor dots crawling across your screen...you'll
know whence it comes.
 
     Or to quote the Terminator...."I need a vacation."
 
     Item the second:
 
     Tomorrow, Wednesday, at 8:00 p.m. in most markets airs a wonderful
stop-motion piece called "The Wrong Trousers" on PBS.  Story in brief:
a man and his dog take in a penguin as a boarder...and the story take a
funny/dark turn worthy of a Hitchcock movie.  It's simply the best thing
I've ever seen in this medium, and encourage everyone to watch.
Absolutely hysterical, and wonderfully done.
 
     Item the third:
 
     To allow for more time to finish the EFX work and some audio work,
we'll probably reverse the first few episodes and start with "There All
the Honor Lies" at the end of April, and spring "And Now for a Word" as
the first true May sweeps episode.
 
     As you were....
