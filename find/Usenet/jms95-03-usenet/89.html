<H2>ATT JMS  Who is third in comma</H2>
14 Mar 1995<PRE>     Actually, I think the third in command would be Major Atumbe, who
we've referenced in dialogue on the show, but have never shown.  I keep
meaning to do so, but it always ends up feeling forced, and it's hard to
work in new recurring characters when we have something like 16 as it is.
