<H2>ATTN: JMS    DC COMICS 4 Story</H2>
16 Mar 1995<PRE>     Laura Hitchcock at DC and I have discussed it, and I'd like to do a
four-issue arc, and she'd like to have me do it, so it'll probably
happen.
 
     I'm playing with the notion of doing the story as a backgrounder;
one probability is setting the story during the start of the Earth
Minbari war, to show how that all got started.  Is there any other
piece of B5 background that we've touched upon in the series (no new
story ideas) that folks might like to see elucidated?  (The next cycle
will show how Garibaldi and Sinclair met.)
