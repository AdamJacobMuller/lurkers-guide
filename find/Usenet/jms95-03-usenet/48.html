<H2>JMS: Babylon-TRGB Connection?</H2>
8 Mar 1995<PRE>      I didn't write that episode of THE REAL GHOSTBUSTERS; I'm fairly
sure (this was a while ago) that Richard Mueller wrote "I Am the City."
 
      (Though I did story edit that script, as well as the 77 others in
that one season.)
 
      Among the episodes I wrote are "Citizen Ghost," "Ragnarok and Roll,"
"The Thing in Mrs. Faversham's Attic," "Xmas Marks the Spot," "Mister
Sandman, Dream Me a Dream," "When Halloween Was Forever," "Chicken, He
Clucked," "No One Comes to Lupusville," and a bunch of others.  In general,
the really sick and twisted ones were usually mine.
 
                                                                 jms
