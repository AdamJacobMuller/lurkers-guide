<H2>ATTN JMS: Influence</H2>
22 Mar 1995<PRE>     Jay...on one level, I understand what you're saying, in theory at
any rate.  Maybe it's because I still don't really take myself very
seriously that I have a fundamental hard time with the notion of becoming
a POP (Person Of Power).  It seems, I dunno, kinda goofy.
 
     So I'm still not really convinced that I have it; or, having it, that
I would *want* it.  It's sort of like the statement, "If nominated I will
not run, if elected I will not serve."
 
     The only thing that truly matters to me is that the work survive, and
that the work receive the attention it deserves because of the hard work
by so many talented people that goes into it...and to tell a story.  As for
me...ehh.  I figure I'm doing good if I can just dress myself....
