<H2>Babylon vs Babylon 5</H2>
18 Mar 1995<PRE>     Actually, while many titles cannot be copyrighted, they CAN be
trademarked, as Babylon 5 is trademarked, and that *can* be enforced.
 
     The "Ghostbusters" story, in brief, is this:  Filmation did a
live-action kids show with Forrest Tucker (it was really awful) some
time before Columbia Pictures/Ivan Reitman did their movie.  Both the
Filmation series and the projected film were called "Ghostbusters,"
a situation that developed when the title failed to show up on a
title search.  With the film about to be released, Filmation made a
considerable stink, and won the rights to a) a lot of cash, and b)
the right to do an animated series called Ghostbusters.
 
     And, in time, that's exactly what was done, much to the chagrin of
Columbia/Ivan Reitman.  In turn, they decided to do their OWN animated
series, and just to pink Filmation, called it "The REAL Ghostbusters."
