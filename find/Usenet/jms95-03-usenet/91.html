14 Mar 1995<PRE>     I very much enjoyed The Avengers, though Kathryn is a much bigger
fan than I am; she's seen just about every one of them.  (They're now
showing the eps in uncut, crystal-clear version over direcTV, which she
is enjoying.)  I don't think it's really any kind of influence, but it's
a great show, no mistake.
