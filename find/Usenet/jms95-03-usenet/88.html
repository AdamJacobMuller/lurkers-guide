<H2>JMS: A few questions for you i</H2>
14 Mar 1995<PRE>     The Mars Colony was really pretty much up and running and fully
operational by the middle 2100s, so you've got a generation or two who
have been born and raised there.
 
     The Psi Corps was established around 2150 or so (I'll have to check
my notes to be sure).  Bester is not a teek.
