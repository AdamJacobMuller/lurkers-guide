<H2>ATTN JMS : A few points</H2>
18 Mar 1995<PRE>     PTEN's fate has not been put on hold; the renewal is coming up same
as last year, in late April.
 
     There's no one escaping Deathwalker's ship; it's just debris spinning
away.  She's dead as a mackeral.
 
     We'll be notified directly by our PTEN liaison when the decision on
pickup is made.
