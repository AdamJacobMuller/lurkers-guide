<H2>ATTN JMS:  Micro Machines Canc</H2>
10 Mar 1995<PRE>     I find this very surprising and somewhat dubious, given that last
I'd heard the orders were going well.  Our demise is ALWAYS being
prematurely announced; lots of folks looking to buy the B5 comic were told
it wasn't coming out, ditto for the novel.  But I'll look into it just to
be sure.
