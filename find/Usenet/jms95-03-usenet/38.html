<H2>ATT: JMS- Generic apology</H2>
8 Mar 1995<PRE>     Robert Christopher...don't be silly.  Though the sentiment is
appreciated, and the gesture a noble and good one, what you describe just
happens; I've been on the nets too long to let most stuff bother me.
 
     I'm not bashful; if you ever do something that requires an apology,
you won't have to wonder about it.  I remember seeing your post, and as it
came in a batch of similar messages, didn't bother me overmuch.
 
     Bottom line...s'okay.  Don't worry about it.
 
     You have nothing to apologize for...well, except for that shirt...and
those *shoes*...c'mon, RC, you gotta stop letting your mom dress you.
 
                                                                    jms
