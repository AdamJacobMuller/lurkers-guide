<H2>B5 Cliches/ Pet Peeve</H2>
3 Mar 1995<PRE>     What can I say...I work with Doug Netter...I can NEVER get out of his
office without being pulled back by a comment or two, and because I'm
absent minded, I'm always adding an afterthought as I leave the room.  So
for my money, this is just how folks talk.
