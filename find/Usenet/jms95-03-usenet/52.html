<H2>Atten JMS: Status on other pro</H2>
8 Mar 1995<PRE>     I hope to have word on some other projects I've been developing over
the next few months.  In all cases, while I'll create the series and will
be nominally exec producer, a secondary show runner will be brought in to
handle most of the work, even though potentially some of the other gigs
would pay more for that position than I'm getting now.  B5 has to come
first.
