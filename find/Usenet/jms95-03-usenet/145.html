<H2>SACRAMENTO! PERMANENT TIME CHA</H2>
20 Mar 1995<PRE>     And if Sacramento has offered an open invitation to folks to write
in about the time change, then I very strongly second this; it may be a
way of seeing if folks *really* want it or not, and if they get enough
support, perhaps it WILL become permanent.
