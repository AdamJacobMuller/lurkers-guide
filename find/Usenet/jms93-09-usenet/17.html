<H2>Re: Physics of Babylon 5</H2>
10 Sep 1993<PRE>     On the issue of tryful in making our physics work,
when I showed the material from B5 at ConFrancisco, one sequence is of a
B5 fighter orienting itself and matching speed and rotation with an
object it's trying to snare.  At one point, someone in the audience called
out, "F=MA."  I thought he was heckling; turns out it was a mathematical
compliment.  Force = Mass x Accelleration, and the way we were handling
the docking and retrieval sequence indicated that the math in how it was
done was correct.
