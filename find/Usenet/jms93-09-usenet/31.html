<H2>Re: Trek vs. B5 - things NOT t</H2>
16 Sep 1993<PRE>     At this point, the only other con I'll probably appear at is LosCon
here in LA in November.  (I say probably only because thus far no one has
contacted me, and can only assume that sooner or later, someone will do
so.)  The main problem is just getting away from town for any prolonged
period of time while we're shooting.  I pretty much have to be at the
stage all the time, since there are always a zillion questions to be
answered, and another zillion meetings every day.  Once we debut, and
we've finished shooting our first season (around late March), I'll be
freer to pop up here and there.
