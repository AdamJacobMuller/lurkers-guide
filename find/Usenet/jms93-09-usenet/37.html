19 Sep 1993<PRE>     Ah, now I understand.  Yes, we will be getting more into the culture
of our aliens, specifically how they relate to one another within their
own societies.  We'll sort of sneak up on this, doing it gradually and
increasing as we go.  We want to focus in primarily on establishing our
main characters and how they relate to one another,and then begin extending
outward.
 
     The same applies to the general arc of the story.  You don't want to
shove too much down somebody's throat all at once (he said, applying
yet another lesson from the pilot).  So the first season, there will be
roughly 4-5 stories that are heavily arc-oriented episodes, though we'll
certainly drop tidbits in other episodes as well.  In the second season,
the plan is to do 7-10 that tie strongly into the arc.  We'll stay pretty
close to that figure for seasons 3 and 4, though 4 may have a few more,
and 5 will have nearly every episode tied directly into the arc, because
by that time most everybody will have twigged to what we're doing,and we
can afford to do that.
