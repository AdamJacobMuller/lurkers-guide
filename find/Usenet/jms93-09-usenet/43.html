<H2>Invoke Silence?</H2>
23 Sep 1993<PRE>     As written in the script, the idea of invoking privacy consisted of
sitting in a booth and, when privacy mode was invoked, the booth seems to
become a solid, black block from the outside.  The director thought the
same effect could be gained via the lights.  It wasn't.  And there won't
be any future instances of this.
