<H2>Re: A look at the competition</H2>
18 Sep 1993<PRE>     The issue of Teen Titans Spotlight was a *lot* of fun to write; I've
always found the character of Two Face interesting, and realized that no
one had ever put that character together with cyborg, who also has a
similar face and resultant problem...except he took a very different path.
I find that writing comics is *much* more difficult that writing TV,
because you have to compensate for the fact that the pictures don't move.
Frankly, some of the most imaginative scriptwriting I see these days in
in comics, from Ostrander and Gaiman and Moore and Morrison and others.
