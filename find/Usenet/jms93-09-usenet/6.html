<H2>Strange comments</H2>
8 Sep 1993<PRE>     The scruffy person in the Varner files was the same homeless person
who we just happen to see sitting right outside Varner's quarters, watching
as he moves along.  This was played by Ron Thornton, because we wouldn't be
seeing him in a major role, we'd just have to know someone was there.
 
     Again, this ties into a specific story line that has been modified
with a) the departure of Laurel, and b) the length of time since the pilot
aired.  Who was the homeless man really?  It's no longer an issue, but it
was related, yes.
 
     But only in a very small way.
