<H2>Re: "Silence" in Babylon-5</H2>
8 Sep 1993<PRE>     In the script, the privacy mode involved going from a standard
looking open booth to what suddenly looked like a flat black cube, which
you could neither hear nor see through.  The director decided to try the
lights.  It didn't work.  We're dropping it.
