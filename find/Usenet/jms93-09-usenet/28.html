<H2>Re: Problem with JMS viewing p</H2>
15 Sep 1993<PRE>     Thanks.  Production is going well.  Bit of news: because of his
desire to do a couple big movies, a new album, and some touring, Stewart
Copeland won't be available for the series.  So we've locked down
Christopher Franke, of Tangerine Dream, who's done the soundtracks for
Thief, Tommyknockers, Angel Falls, Universal Soldier and a bunch of other
projects.
