<H2>Re: Scene I would like to see</H2>
9 Sep 1993<PRE>     I think the alt.tv.babylon-5.creative might work.  Frankly, all I
see of Internet is what's fed to me through GEnie, and it's just this
one thread.  I'm not on it per se.  So all I have to do is make sure I
don't get this thread to be at least marginally protected.
