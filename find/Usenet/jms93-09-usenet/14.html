<H2>Babylon a poor name</H2>
10 Sep 1993<PRE>     The most common term I hear around is "Fivers."  Though someone came
up with the notion of using the Roman numeral for 5, V, and decided that
fans of Babylon 5 could properly be called "BVers."  Pronounced "beavers."
 
     Naturally, we had him killed.
