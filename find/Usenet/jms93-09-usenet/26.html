<H2>Re: Trek vs. B5 - things NOT t</H2>
14 Sep 1993<PRE>     My feeling here is, don't worry about the show, regarding your
overcoming on the pilot.  Pilots are good, bad or uneven.  What matters
in the analysis is the series.  You can have a great pilot and a
disappointing series.  And vice-versa.  The series will air.  If it's
good, people will watch, whatever they may have thought about the pilot.
If it ain't good, people won't watch, and deservedly so.  In other words,
the ball's in our court now.
