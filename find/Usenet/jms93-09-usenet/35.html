<H2>Babylon-5</H2>
19 Sep 1993<PRE>     I was at the Emmys tonight for the presentation of the B5 Emmy, and
in the visual efx area, more than one shoe can get an Emmy.  So we got one,
DS9's pilot got one, and Lucas' Young Indy show got one.  (We sat at the
next table to Lucas and his bunch, in fact, and noted that he watched the
B5 footage with considerable interest.)  So when you come right down to it,
here we were, our first shot out of the box, and we ended up on the same
level of appreciation as Trek and Lucas.  Not too dusty....
