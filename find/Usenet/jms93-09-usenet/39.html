<H2>Who exactly is JMS?</H2>
21 Sep 1993<PRE>     To follow on Jonathan's note, and also give more info on what it is
exactly I do...I created Babylon 5 in 1986/87, and have battled, along with
Doug Netter, my business associate and fellow executive producer, to get
this project to series for over six years.  I wrote and co-exec produced
the pilot movie, the series bible and treatment, and will be/am writing
roughly half the series episodes as well as exec producing.  (Th
difference is that you just drop the co- from your title.)
 
     What do I do exactly?  Aside from writing my own scripts, I assign
stories to other writers, and select those writers to work with.  (Because
B5 is tied to a story arc, many of our freelance scripts are based upon
assigned stories.)  I'm also involved in every single stage of the series
production: minus any notes from the studio (which are minimal, our last
project got no notes at all, they're leaving us very much alone), Doug and
I have final say over jevery aspect of the series.  (Generally Doug is more
the businessman and deal maker, leaving most of the creative details to
me.)  I do casting, work with the art directors on graphics, approve and
work with the set designers, wardrobe people, prosthetics team, computer
graphics team, visual effects, every single department.  I get final say
on the editing of the shows, mussound effects, you name it.
 
     One thing that distinguishes this show, I think, is that it's very
much a *personal vision*.  This is my show, the way I want it to look, and
sound, and feel.  And my feeling is that this is either going to work
big-time...or we're going to go down in the biggest blast since Tunguska.
