<H2>Re: diversity in actors</H2>
11 Sep 1993<PRE>     No, the dustbin contains expressions that are in common use by just
about everybody in America...except those who get it *right*.
 
     I should think that those in the entertainment business might just
have some latitude in deciding what they should be called, don't you?
Or do you feel that others should define who and what you are?  You sign
your name "Stewart."  Should we all instead call you "Sparky the Wonder
Dog" because that's what we prefer calling you?  Or do you have any voice
at all in your name, your profession, your identity?
 
     You get a vote in what people call you.  Dentists get a vote in what
people call them.  Gynecologists get a vote in what people call them
(thus avoiding confusion with proctologists, even though both are doctors
whose specializations are within inches of one another).  And people in
the entertainment industry get a vote in what people call THEM.
 
     Where in this is your problem?
