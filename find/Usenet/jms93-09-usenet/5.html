<H2>Re: diversity in actors</H2>
8 Sep 1993<PRE>     We're casting people of every ethnicity, and every height.  Including
shorter actors.  A guest starring character in "Believers" by David
Gerrold is a Hispanic woman doctor, who's at *most* 5'2".  We didn't go
looking for height, or shortness, only who was the best actor.
