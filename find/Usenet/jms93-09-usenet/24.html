<H2>Centauri hair</H2>
14 Sep 1993<PRE>     There will be both sex and romance on B5 (sometimes together,
sometimes not).  It's perversely appropriate that in the B5 series, it's
not the Commander who gets laid first, or Garibaldi, or G'Kar...it's
Londo.  And it's a very funny, but very touching and moving episode.
