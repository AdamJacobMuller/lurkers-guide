<H2>Re: WorldCon presentation on F</H2>
10 Sep 1993<PRE>     I didn't say they covered it up or ignored it.  In any event, it
might be best to wait until you've seen the full episode before we start
talking reviews and concerns.  Right now you're responding to what *might*
be the point of the episode; best to wait until it's aired so that we can
discuss what *is* there.
