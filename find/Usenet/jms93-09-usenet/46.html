25 Sep 1993<PRE>     "makes me wonder as to the wisdom of releasing shots of what could be
some of the best CGI to come out of (B5)."
 
     Lemme give you a little hint about something.
 
     We didn't let out the best.  We let out the *least*.  For the very
reasons you specify.  And that was done at the very earliest stages of CGI
work on the series.
 
     It gets far, far, FAR cooler than that.
