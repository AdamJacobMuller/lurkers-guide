<H2>Re: Trent/Demon with a Glass H</H2>
11 Sep 1993<PRE>     The kyben are not necessarily part of the B5 universe.  First, the
events that propelled Trent into the past don't happen for about another
1500 years past B5's time.  Second, it's still a *possible* future, not the
ONLY future.  So there's latitude here.
