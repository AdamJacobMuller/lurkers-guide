<H2>Problem with JMS viewing possi</H2>
10 Sep 1993<PRE>     It's a valid possibility.  All I know is that the only way I'm now
getting Internet at all is because Ron Jarrell (as I recall) set up my
account as an Internet gateway for this specific group.  I don't see
anything else because I'm not set up by him to see anything else.
