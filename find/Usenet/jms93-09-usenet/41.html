<H2>Re: Babylon 5's Emmy award.</H2>
22 Sep 1993<PRE>     Just to set your mind at ease, Sinclair does not routinely take out
the fighter craft on routine reconnaisance missions.  In one episode,
"Midnight on the Firing Line," he goes for a very specific reason for which
ONLY he can go, and in "Soul Hunter" he goes because of a First Contact
protocol.  Otherwise, others are sent.
