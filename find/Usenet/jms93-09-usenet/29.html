<H2>Re: Scene I would like to see</H2>
15 Sep 1993<PRE>     Just because there seems to be some misapprehension going on here,
a point of clarification.  My initial "not here" message was not in
response to some idle speculations about the show.  There was a message
which contained a *detailed* story suggestion.  With luck, someone here
who saw it can verify that.  I do not react like that lightly; only when
necessary.
 
     You may think that this "paranoia thing has gotten out of hand."
That's as may be.  You're not on the receiving end.  I know many friends
who have been at the receiving end of nuisance lawsuits, which consumes
literally hundreds of thousands of dollars, and months to a *year* of
someone's life.  And that even though they win the case.  It can kill a
year of your life, exhaust your bank accounts (which are often not able to
be recovered) in a lawsuit which may not even get to *court*.  Sometimes
its a lawyer-spouse, sometimes just another goddamned greedy ambulance
chaser who doesn't know a thing about creative issues, who's only after it
in the hopes of getting a big settlement rather than a prolonged court
case.
