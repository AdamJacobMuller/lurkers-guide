<H2>Scene I would like to see</H2>
8 Sep 1993<PRE>     Please do not post story suggestions for my view here.  Any time this
is done jeapordizes my ability to do anything approaching that story
because of the ever-present reality of plagiarism suits.  What you just
proposed cuts into a story that we're developing, and now we're going to
have to modify that in order to avoid any problems.  This kind of thing
causes us great difficulty.  You can reassure all you want, but that
doesn't change the reality...you seem like a nice fellow, but I don't know
you, don't know if you'll change your mind, don't know anything.  So I've
had to make a blanket policy regarding stories: you can come up with
stories, or I can be present.  It's one or the other.  I don't mean to
sound harsh, because I know your intentions are good, but if this occurs
again, I'm going to have to bail out of Internet altogether.  This has
happened once already; three would be too much.
