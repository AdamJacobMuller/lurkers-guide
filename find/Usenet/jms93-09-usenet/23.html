<H2>A look at the competition</H2>
14 Sep 1993<PRE>     Frankly, I really don't see that DSV is in competition with B5, any
more than, say, "Northern Exposure" is in competition with "Picket
Fences."  They're different shows, on at different times.  Were they on
on head-to-head, that'd be different.
 
     That said, my two cents worth, re: "Seaquest" and "Lois and Clark,"
hated it, loved them.
