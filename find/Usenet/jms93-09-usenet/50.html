<H2>E! show question about ship ID</H2>
30 Sep 1993<PRE>     The ship you see performing the rescue in the E! clips is one of
the B5 fighters, located in their own docking bays in the station within
the cobra-like arms you see on the sides of the forward part of the
station (and hence nicknamed cobra bays).
