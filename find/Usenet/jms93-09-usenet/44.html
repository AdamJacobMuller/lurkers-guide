<H2>A question for Joe</H2>
24 Sep 1993<PRE>     My understanding of ANYthing to do with our CGI is limited and
imperfect at best, but it's my understanding that we are indeed rendering
it at 16:9.
 
     Re: the episodes...thus far we're coming in on time, and on budget,
and our episodes are timing out about right, i.e., we're not having to cut
scenes out altogether, as we did in the pilot.  We're using just about
everything we shoot, minus any snippets here and there to pick up the pace
within a scene.
