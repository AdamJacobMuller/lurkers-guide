<H2>Re: Arc.  Season II.  Big Pict</H2>
12 Jan 1995<PRE>     We could not film anything extensive with Michael because we don't
shoot on the Warners lot, where there are facilities available.  We went
our separate ways around late April/early May or so, after we had stopped
shooting.  We're a small operation; when we make the series, we rent our
equipment from Panavision, our lights from other places, sound equipment,
some props...anything we don't rent goes into storage.  Our entire camera
crew -- ALL of them -- were off doing another project.
 
     I understand your feelings, but there are certain realities we have
to work with, and if the cast is gone off either on vacation, out of the
country, or on other projects (as all of them were), all of our crew is
gone, and all of our equipment is gone, it's kinda hard to oblige your
request to do scenes with these characters.  We had none of this back in
our hands until we began shooting again in August, by which time Michael
had long been in New York pursuing other projects.
