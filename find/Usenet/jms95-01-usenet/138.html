<H2>ATTN JMS: Why Accelerate the A</H2>
24 Jan 1995<PRE>    I may not have been clear in my meaning when I said "accellerating
the arc."  This doesn't mean doing anything ahead of schedule; it just
means that now we begin cranking the story into a higher intensity level.
We've been kind of floating toward our destination...now we begin the
process of accellerating.  If you recall Literary Structure from English
Lit 101, there's the Introduction, the Rising Action, the Complication,
the Climax, and the Denouement.  Year one up through about the first
eight episodes of year two are Introduction; we are now in Rising Action
stage.  Remember that this is structured like a novel, and you'll
generally have some idea of where you stand in the progression.
