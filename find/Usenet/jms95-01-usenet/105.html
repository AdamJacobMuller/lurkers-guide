<H2>Attn JMS: did show concept cha</H2>
20 Jan 1995<PRE>     There was never any intention whatsoever of doing B5 within the
context of the Star Trek universe.  It was always intended as a wholly
original concept.  It was taken to a half dozen or more studios, and
that included Paramount, yes, but Paramount doesn't just do Trek.  I never
wanted to tell this story in the ST universe because it *couldn't* be told
there; the rules that confine story areas simply wouldn't let it happen.
