<H2>Personal Query from JMS</H2>
15 Jan 1995<PRE>     For a while now, I've been trying to find some old friends with whom
I've lost all contact.  Given the resource here, and the theory that we
are all only 6 people away from anybody else...I thought I'd try it here.
If anybody should know how to contact the following people, if y'all
could send me a note I'd be greatly appreciative.
 
     Liz or Elizabeth Ochoa.  Last known to be in San Diego.  Red hair,
Basque background.  Rose tattoo on left wrist.  Resided in San Diego from
1978 through 1981, had a 4-year old son named (I believe) Justin (who
would now be about 19).  Liz would be roughly 39-40 years old.
 
     Colleen Carnevale, also from San Diego, same age range.  Blonde, and
formerly, through her father, a member of the San Diego Yacht Club.  She
worked at the Whaley House up through about 1979, and worked as an
Orientation Counselor at SDSU through about 1978.  May be married now.
 
     Joanne Massie, formerly a high school teacher at Chula Vista High
School, 1972.  Last I'd heard she had moved to Texas around 1975.
 
     (Mrs. Massie was the one who got me into writing when I was just a
kid, gave me the chance to follow my abilities.)
 
     Joe or Joseph Trez, 40-41, resident of Matawan, New Jersey in about
1970.  Nothing since.
 
     Sherily Mattarocci, roughly 34, may now be married with a different
name.  Formerly from Bonita, California.  (Oops, make that Sherilyn, not
Sherily.)
 
     Marcus Manecke, former cult member (Children of God), 42-44, lived
in religious commune (unrelated to CoG) in Chula Vista through 1978, may
now be living in the New England area.  He was also a musician.
 
     Any info should be sent via private email.  These are all friends,
just would like to find out whatever happened to them.  Thanks.
