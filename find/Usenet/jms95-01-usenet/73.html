<H2>Attn JMS -- "Producer's cut" S</H2>
15 Jan 1995<PRE>     The various drafts of the script have all the missing scenes, and may
in time become available directly through Babylonian Productions along
with other scripts.  The computer images are too grainy to ever be used
in any kind of laserdisk or tape, very low-res.
 
     The whole issue of the pilot still rankles me, on a personal level.
I was still fairly new to executive producing, and was more prone to just
accept the word of the director or the editor that this was as good as the
cut would get, this was how it should stay.  I didn't speak up on some of
my concerns, didn't just go in and re-edit the whole damned thing the way
I felt I should have.  It was my error, and there's no one else to blame
for it.
 
     I've learned since to trust my instincts.  So when John Copeland and
I go in to edit the episodes, we edit these things so tight they scream.
In retrospect, I probably could've fit in about 18 minutes of the 20
or so minutes we ended up cutting, by judicious editing, line-cutting,
and just picking up the pace of the thing in every scene.  It's one of
those, "If I knew then what I know now..." situations.
 
     If we had the budget to re-edit the damned thing, which alas we
don't, I can assure you it would be a VERY different-looking movie.
 
     My fault.  Nobody else's.
