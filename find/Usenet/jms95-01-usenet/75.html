<H2>Re: Att'n JMS:  Death and Dyin</H2>
15 Jan 1995<PRE>     "Not to cast aspersions on the physique of JMS, but he's not the
youngest buck in the forest, forest, nor the sveltest.  What if he dies?"
 
     HEY!  I'll have you know I'm just 40 years old, and at 6'5" I'm maybe
ten pounds more than I should be.  Granted it all seems to have settled in
one or two places, but I attribute that to the gravitational influence of
a pinhole black hole that must have drifted past recently.
 
     As to the question, "What if he dies?"...what happens is that they
come and pick me up, bring me to the nearest mortuary, I'm autopsied,
needles are inserted in my heel and elbow, the blood is removed from my
body, embalming fluid is subsequently pumped in, I'm dressed in an
ill-fitting suit, displayed briefly (against my wishes), shoved into a
crematorium, my remains are transferred to ash, and I spend THE NEXT TEN
THOUSAND YEARS HAUNTING YOUR ASS FOR ASKING A MORBID QUESTION LIKE THAT!!!
 
     All my notes are triple-encrypted.  Only I know the password.  So it's
in the best interests of EVERYBODY to keep my ass ALIVE for the next 3.5
years.
