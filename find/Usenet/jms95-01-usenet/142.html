<H2>ATTN: JMS - CANADA</H2>
24 Jan 1995<PRE>     "Have you ever mentioned Canada in B5?"
 
     No, but I've mentioned San Diego.  Would you like me to extend the
honor up north?
 
     ("Okay, Rudy, load up another one of them five-hundred megaton jobs.")
 
     Just kidding...I'm pleased that it's going over well in Canada, and
will see what I can do to nod in that direction without irradiating the
place.
