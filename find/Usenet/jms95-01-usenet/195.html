<H2>JMS:  Repeats and Canonical Ep</H2>
31 Jan 1995<PRE>     All episodes will tend to be repeated in original airdate order; but
this doesn't bother me particularly, since if the series can't survive
being viewed out of order, then it's flawed.
 
     And yes, I believe they'll be picking up season 1's last reruns after
the end of season 2.
