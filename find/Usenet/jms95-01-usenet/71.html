<H2>JMS: Do Doctors Still Speciali</H2>
15 Jan 1995<PRE>     Negative; your assumption is incorrect.  Dr. Franklin is chief of
staff of the medlab facility, and has been introduced as such.  We have
seen many other doctors, from Dr. Maya Hernandez to the asian doctor
brought in to help save Garibaldi in "Chrysalis."  There are probably
about 100-150 doctors on B5, and we'll be showing more of them as we go
on in the show.
