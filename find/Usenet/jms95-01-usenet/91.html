18 Jan 1995<PRE>     Re: the fate of any possible actor on the show...like I said, I've
built in trap doors for everybody on the show with one fairly obvious
exception.  (Viz: me.)
 
     Hey, I've *read* Scherezade (though I can't spell it for squat); I
ain't no fool.
 
     As for "all this attention"...you're still talking mainly about the
online community; the majority of the American public still doesn't know
the show even *exists*.
 
     But we're getting there.
