<H2>Cortez- Awesome Ship Name!</H2>
6 Jan 1995<PRE>     BTW, just to note a little something you might not notice in the
show...we've adopted the tradition of putting the symbol for a given ship
onto the bar in Earhart's, as many real contemporary officers' clubs and
airforce/naval base clubs put the logos or markings of big planes or ships
that come through there.  The Cortez symbol is the most visible among the
various emblems you can see in a shot of the bar in "A Race Through Dark
Places."  It comes at the moment we follow *another* old military tradition.
