<H2>JMS:  THANK YOU FOR B5 FROM HA</H2>
26 Jan 1995<PRE>     Thank you.  Have had only passing experience with Robotech; I've just
never been able to get into Anime.  Glad to hear that 38 supports the
show; I hear they're okay people.
 
     In any event...thanks again for the encouragement.  It helps.
