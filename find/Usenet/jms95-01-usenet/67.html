<H2>Re: - JMS on Patrick Stewart</H2>
15 Jan 1995<PRE>     To the best of my knowledge, NONE of the ST actors have any problem
with any of the B5 actors, and vice-versa.  Much as some divisive fan
would, as you say, like their characters to reflect their own feelings,
the reality simply isn't there.
