<H2>JMS: Babylon 5 and new watcher</H2>
26 Jan 1995<PRE>     I'm not sure I understand what faces you have to recognize to follow
"Race."  Bester is re-introduced with an explanation, as is Jason.  You
don't have to recognize the guy from "Chrysalis;" if you do, great, it
adds a level.  If you don't, it still tracks.  The only other characters
are our reglars; so I'm confused as to what there was left to confuse them.
