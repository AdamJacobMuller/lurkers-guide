<H2>ATTN: JMS on publicity</H2>
28 Jan 1995<PRE>     Let me be clear on this: we will take ANY opportunity, any help in
getting the word out.  In many ways we are treated with a "stealth
publicity" campaign by some within the studio; keep a low profile, or
else god forbid somebody might write an article.  So all aid -- putting
the word out, asking local papers for coverage, writing to magazines,
anything and everything -- is appreciated.
