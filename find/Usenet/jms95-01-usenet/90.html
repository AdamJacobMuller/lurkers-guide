<H2>Re: Outer Limits on Showtime:</H2>
18 Jan 1995<PRE>      Basically, I hated everything about the story...it was one of the
old "three word endings" that are symptomatic of bad SF ("The killer's...
OSWALD!"), it destroys the Kennedy image for NO reason, it's a dumb
idea, it has no dramatic progression of any kind...it's just a dumbness.
 
     I like alternative history stories as much as anybody; this one just
was awful.
