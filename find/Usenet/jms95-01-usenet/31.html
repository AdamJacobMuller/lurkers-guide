6 Jan 1995<PRE>     RE: "a TV episode usually takes 10-16 days to make," (Kokko), not
quite correct.  We do the actual on-stage shooting in 7 days.  (Most shows
are shot anywhere from 6-9 days per episode.)  Then it takes another week
or so to edit, then the producers re-edit, then you spot the show for
visual EFX and music, CGI is working, you mix the episode...the actual
time required to physically make an episode once you begin principal
photography is closer to 6-8 weeks.
