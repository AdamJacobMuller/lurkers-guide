<H2>Re: Att'n JMS:  Death and Dyin</H2>
18 Jan 1995<PRE>     I hope to make this my last message on the subject, in hopes that this
topic will finally...er...die off.  It's really kinda morbid when you're
on this end of the modem.
 
     Bottom line...it ain't a matter of making sure somebody gets my notes
on the overall storyline.  If you're a painter, you can give someone your
notes on how to finish the painting in case something happens, but it won't
be done *exactly* the way you would want it.  So better to leave it
unfinished, with that part which *is* finished being 100% what you wanted
it to be, than let it be completed by others, and not necessarily as well.
 
     This show has to be done exactly, a certain way, or it won't be what
I *want* it to be.  My notes are for my own use.  Maybe that sounds selfish
or self-indulgent.  Maybe it is.  There are lots of writers out there as
good or better than I am.  That ain't the problem.  Give 10 writers the
same basic parameters and you'll get 10 different stories.  This is my
story.  And where I go, it goes.
