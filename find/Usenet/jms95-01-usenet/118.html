<H2>Attn. JMS:  Flashbacks?</H2>
22 Jan 1995<PRE>     I don't like loose threads hanging around, so all this will get tied
up.  In some cases, we'll see flashbacks to stuff that happened "around the
corner," so to speak, and in others we'll have dialogue explanations.  WE
get the scoop on what question Delenn asked Kosh (via Lennier) before this
season is out.
