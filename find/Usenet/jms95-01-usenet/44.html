<H2>Technomage Symbol</H2>
11 Jan 1995<PRE>     No, actually, the technomage symbol (all of them, actually, including
the ones on the wall) are all derivations, specifically altered, of old
runes and the like.  In some cases, we removed words and inserted
mathematical symbols.  The fiery symbol is all one piece, and is also an
old rune.
