<H2>Re: Homosexuality argument</H2>
23 Jan 1995<PRE>     ARE YOU PEOPLE ALL STILL ARGUING ABOUT THIS STUFF?
 
     OKAY, THAT'S IT.  EVERYBODY CLEAR OUT.  EVERYBODY OUTTA THE POOL.  I
DON'T WANT THIS JOINT BASHED UP AND BEAT UP EVERY TIME SOMEBODY DRAGS THIS
ARGUMENT OUT OF THE CLOSET!  THERE'S GOTTA BE AN ISSUES FORUM SOMEWHERE!
 
     IT'S LIKE THE GODDAMN DRAZI...EVERY FIVE YEARS YOU DIVIDE UP INTO TWO
CAMPS AND BEAT THE CRAP OUTTA EACH OTHER!  AND AS IVANOVA SAID, "GRANTED
THE OTHER RACES WOULDN'T *MIND* IF YOU KILL ONE ANOTHER, EVEN THEY WOULD
PREFER YOU DID SO *QUIETLY*."
 
     Okay?  Take it outside, people.
 
     I don't care who's wrong, I don't care who's right, I don't care
who had the last word or who got offended last.  Take it outside.
