<H2>Off Topic?</H2>
27 Jan 1995<PRE>     Sci-Fi Channel has indicated many times that they would like t
acquire Captain Power, but (in what I must say I think is a doofy move)
the producer won't release the show unless SFC agrees to finance new eps.
Cart before the horse, if you ask me.  Get the show on first, create the
need, THEN do more.
 
     Doofy, I tell you.  Doofy, doofy, doofy.  Maybe even doofiest.
