<H2>Re: -  JMS on Patrick Stewart/</H2>
3 Jan 1995<PRE>     Got no problem with somebody not liking B5.  Not a one.  My only
problem is when you have a few people so determined to protect the
integrity of their fictional characters and their allegiance to one show
that they must assume Stewart or someone else is lying, which then
DIMINISHES the person's integrity.  It seems to me a little like the old
Vietnam idea of burning the village to save the village.  I'm perfectly
happy to let ANYONE not like B5 *on its own terms*.  It's only when the
clique mentality sets in that I have a problem with it...and again, this
applies only to a fairly small (but *very* loud) portion of ST fans.
