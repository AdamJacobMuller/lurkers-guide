<H2>JMS: Switched Episode Order? [</H2>
29 Jan 1995<PRE>     Yes, originally, "Soul Mates" was to air after "Race."  At that
time, PTEN was initially going to show just 6 new episodes, and we would
have come in after the rerun break with "Race," then "Soul."  When the
ratings came in and looked good, they didn't want to interfere with
the growth, and indicated they wanted to show 7 new eps in the first
batch.  "Race," as you can see, was a very complex episode visually, and
the only way to get it ready to run #7 in the first batch would've been
to compromise the integrity of the show, and we simply won't do that for
ANY reason.  "Soul Mates," on the other hand, required very little in the
way of post production, so that was moved forward into the #7 slot.
