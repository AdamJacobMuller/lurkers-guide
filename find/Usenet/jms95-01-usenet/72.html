<H2>JMS: Jovian moons</H2>
15 Jan 1995<PRE>     I think we'll probably get around to showing more of the Jovian
moons one of these days.
 
     We're also taking advantage of some of the recent Hubble photographs
to scan them and use them as backgrounds in some far-space shots; there's
one in "The Coming of Shadows," for instance.  Real space is *very* nice
looking in places.
