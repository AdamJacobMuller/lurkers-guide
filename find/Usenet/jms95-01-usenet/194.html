<H2>JMS: Military model for Earthf</H2>
31 Jan 1995<PRE>     Your analysis is not far off the mark.  There's some of the
Stalinist approach, also some of the early Roman approach, where there
was a great deal of overlap between senators and the military.  Because
of having to pull so many different traditions together, I also figure
it's kind of a hodge-podge, each division pulling for its own identity
which may or may not be somewhat obsolete by now.
