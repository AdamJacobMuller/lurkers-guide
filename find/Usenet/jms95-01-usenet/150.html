<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Why Accelerate t</H2>
25 Jan 1995<PRE>     I actually didn't go to any of the major film/sports schools; not
UCLA or USC.  I attended (in order) Kankakee Community College, Kankakee,
Illinois; Richland Junior College, Dallas, Texas; Southwestern Junior
College, Chula Vista, CA; and finally San Diego State University.  Loved
all my writing and literature courses.
