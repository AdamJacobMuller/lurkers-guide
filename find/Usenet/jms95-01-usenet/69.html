15 Jan 1995<PRE>     Tagging this here because I don't know where else to tag it...I just
got a GEnie note saying that approximately 100 letters from the Internet
gateway never got to me; many are just rec-arts, but there's also on the
list headers from a4jinna, roland@festival, TrboTurtle, dd36+, northrup@
chuma, anewton, brauchfu, and others.  Just a warning...stuff does get
munched sometimes.
