<H2>Re: Diversity of B5 populace</H2>
12 Jan 1995<PRE>     My original reply somehow got bumped back; the panels on the uniforms
are always leather.  Correct on the red piping and other changes; one of
the problems with last season's uniforms was that they kinda blurred on
camera, and the details went away.  The piping helps the details to pop
a bit better on camera.  The cuffs were changed because in the old version,
the leather cuffs caused the cuffs to gather, and never looked clean or
crisp, which a real uniform would.  So we changed it.  I've been told what
the rest of the uniforms are made of, but for the life of me can't recall
just now.
