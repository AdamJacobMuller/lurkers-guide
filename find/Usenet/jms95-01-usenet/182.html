<H2>BABYLON 5...AFTER THE METAL WA</H2>
29 Jan 1995<PRE>     Yes, I worked on CAPTAIN POWER, and stuck the reference to Babylon
5 into one of my scripts as a nod to the future; did the same in one of
my novels, OTHERSYDE.  Sort of a Tuckerism-before-the-fact.  (One good
thing about this is that it inadvertantly ended up helping make it clear
to people that I was working on this sucker since 1986/87 or so.)
