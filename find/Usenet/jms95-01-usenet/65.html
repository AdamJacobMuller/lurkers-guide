<H2>Starfuries on patrol.</H2>
15 Jan 1995<PRE>     The starfuries were deployed from lunar bases, also from carriers
that dropped everything they had.
 
     Since this was a last-ditch effort, there was no point in keeping
reserve starfuries on-board, and the big ships still made huge targets.
This was almost entirely an offensive maneuver, not defensive.  You pop
everything you've got, figuring that probably nobody will make it back.
