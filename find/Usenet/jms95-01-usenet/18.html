<H2>Re: JMS: Patrick Stewart/B5/Tr</H2>
3 Jan 1995<PRE>     Thanks for reminding me; quite correct, Michael O'Hare was invited to
take (and did take) a tour of the set for one of the Star Trek movies; I
guess it would've been Generations.  He went, and was well received, and
Shatner said he liked the show.  (Though *there*, I suspect, it may have
been more politeness, given the reaction as it was expressed to me.  But
I could be wrong.)
