<H2>Signal/Noise in B5 and commerc</H2>
1 Jan 1995<PRE>     The signal/noise problem was of particular annoyance during the first
four or five episodes.  We deliver on perfect D2 digital masters.  We
kept seeing problems on broadcast that weren't there upon delivery.  We
did a thorough investigation, and learned that the people contracted with
by PTEN/Warners to handle stuff like closed captioning, and transferring
film, and reformatting for commercials, and adding commercials, were
using ANALOG tape, for starters, and sometimes, we discovered to our
horror, USED STOCK.

     It took us some time to fully detail and investigate the situation,
with the result that several people found themselves with new bodily
orifices chewed into their anatomy.  By about episode four or five it
began to look substantially better.
