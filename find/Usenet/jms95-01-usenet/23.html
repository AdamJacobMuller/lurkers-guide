5 Jan 1995<PRE>     Re: "...some B5 fans who act the same way," I think there are in
general fewer of them, mainly because we haven't been on 25 years and
become an icon.  And I generally discourage it; on CIS in particular, and
here, I've noted that there are good people working hard on ST, but are
being held back from doing all they're capable of doing by the studio's
franchise approach.  They should not catch the rap for this; it's unfair.
 
     I should also mention that the most vociferous B5 viewers in terms
of ragging on Trek are generally those who are disenchanted and angry ST
fans who feel they've been let down, and have something now to compare
the other show with.  This unhappiness was there a LONG time before B5
ever hit the screens.
