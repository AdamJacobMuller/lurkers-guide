<H2>ATTN: JMS - Christianity in 23</H2>
23 Jan 1995<PRE>     Many religious types in 2259 feel that god has appeared to other
worlds in different forms; others feel that it is their obligation to go
out into the galaxy and bring the *right* word; in other cases, whole new
schisms and belief systems sprouted once alien contact had been made,
including Foundationalism, which Dr. Franklin belongs to (you'll hear
more about this from Franklin later this season).
