<H2>ATTN JMS:  O'Hare presence = s</H2>
29 Jan 1995<PRE>     I have never stated, at any time, any specifics about the amount or
duration of Sinclair's presence in the B5 storyline yet to come because
a) there are things I wish to withhold, and b) some things must remain
fluid because if Michael should get, for instance, a major role on a big
network series offered to him, and with no guarantees of B5 next season,
he would have to take it.  There are certain things planned, but I don't
generally pin this stuff down until I'm absolutely sure I've nailed down
all the corners.  We *will* see him briefly this season, and we will see
more of him soon.  Beyond that I haven't commented, and won't comment.
