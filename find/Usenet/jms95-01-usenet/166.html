<H2>ATTN: JMS Big Bang con</H2>
27 Jan 1995<PRE>     I'm *terrible* at gambling.  I might as well just pile the money on
the coffetable and put a match to it.  Which is why I generally stay far
away, or allow only small amounts of money (have actually only gambled a
couple of times, been to Vegas only once).  I'm basically an obsessive-
compulsive personality, and the LAST thing you want to do is hand someone
like that a drink, a cigarette, a joint or a pair of dice (which is why
I don't generally drink, smoke, do drugs or gamble).  I'd rather direct
that obsessive behavior toward writing.
