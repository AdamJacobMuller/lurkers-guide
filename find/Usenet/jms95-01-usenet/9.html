<H2>The Hugo Awards: Opinions</H2>
2 Jan 1995<PRE>     Far be it from me to try and influence people's opinions.  Well, all
right...six inches away...but I'd tend to agree on the selection of
"Chrysalis" out of all the season one episodes to nominate.  I still tend
to think it was the best of the batch (though "Babylon Squared" and "Signs
and Portents" come darned close.)  Question, though: are we sure that
"Chrysalis" falls into the eligibility period for nomination?  I know
there's a cutoff date at some point, though it's probably the year's end,
so we should be okay.
