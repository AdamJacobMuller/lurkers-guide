8 Jan 1995<PRE>     On the other hand, if one follows the logic that a ship traveling is
more likely to encounter danger than a stationary vessel, then one must
now make the leap in logic that a bus traveling from New Jersey to
Connecticut will have more dangerous incidents in 24 hours than New York
City.
 
     Bear in mind the crucial difference here...the Enterprise has maybe
seven hundred, a thousand or so members of the same service, chosen for
compatibility.  Babylon 5 has roughly two hundred and fifty thousand
humans and aliens on board at any given moment, many from races where
there is conflict between them.  I think the latter is bound to produce
more and broader-based danger than the other.
