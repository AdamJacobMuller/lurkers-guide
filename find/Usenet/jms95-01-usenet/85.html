<H2>JMS: Sinclair leaving B5</H2>
18 Jan 1995<PRE>      That story is absolutely, 100% bogus, and is one of a number of
destructive, false rumors floating around right now.  When we were
contemplating what to do with the role of Sinclair, we called Michael
in, and we talked about it.  Nobody sent anybody a letter saying
you're outta here.  That's a flat-out lie, nothing less, and whoever
told you (Chris) this is either misremembering or deliberately giving
out false information.  Nor have there been any problems between the
company and Michael.  This is claptrap, nothing less.
