3 Jan 1995<PRE>     Battlestar Galactica really isn't applicable to this discussion
because 1) the "arena" under discussion has always been Earth in its future
with humanity as a spacefaring civilization, which comprises 95% of all
written SF, but had not been done on TV since Trek, and 2) Battlestar
was really more of a Star Wars "homage" (he said politely), that has
nothing to do with ST in *any* event.
