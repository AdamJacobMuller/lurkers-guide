<H2>JMS: Personal re: Chris Franke</H2>
5 Jan 1995<PRE>     I genuinely have no idea if Chris is still doing "Mantis" or not; I
know they're flailing right now in the ratings, and that they're making a
lot of changes...basically, anything that ain't nailed down.  (And anything
that they can pry up ain't nailed down.)  If one of those would be a
change in composers, I wouldn't be at all surprised, given that scenario,
but I honestly don't know one way or another; it's not something we tend
to discuss.  We talk B5 with Chris, period.  I don't think the rest is
any of my damned business.
 
     One rather wishes other people we both could name would adopt a
similar philosophy....
