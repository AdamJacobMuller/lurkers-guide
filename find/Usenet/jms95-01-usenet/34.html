8 Jan 1995<PRE>     In addition to the other good reasons for using Jupiter's moons
that Nyrath stated, there's also the added element of energy (it's near
Jupiter itself), and a base placed off Io would be somewhat more difficult
to target from afar given the massive energy output from Jupiter, which
would help mask things a bit.
