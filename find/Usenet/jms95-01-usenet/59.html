<H2>JMS: Why only one telepath?</H2>
13 Jan 1995<PRE>     Actually, since there aren't that many telepaths around, they cost a
LOT to lease.  There probably should be more than one on B5, but the Corps
hasn't gotten around to sending anybody else yet...so she's appropriately
frazzled a lot of the time.
 
     Humans rarely do things the way they should, logically....
