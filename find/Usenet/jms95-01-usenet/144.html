<H2>ATTN JMS: reading SF</H2>
25 Jan 1995<PRE>     One of the drawbacks to producing/writing a series is that it leaves
you no time for...well, for *anything* else.  Thus I haven't been able to
do much reading of late, though I keep buying books for when I have free
time.  I love reading other authors; I like to be amazed.
 
     I'd certainly recommend the works of Jonathan Carroll, particularly
THE LAND OF LAUGHS if you can find it, or any of his later novels (VOICE
OF OUR SHADOWS is also quite nice).  He's a contemporary-dark-fantasy
writer who is *breathtakingly* good.
 
     Most of the reading I do now is nonfiction, just to give the brain a
break from storytelling.  I *strongly* commend THE LETTERS OF NORMAN CORWIN
to anyone out there.  Also currently reading Hunter S. Thompson's new book,
BETTER THAN SEX, just finished a book (alas I've just forgotten the title)
by a woman raised in the Mormon church about her life in that world.  Also
working my way through Ed Morrow's GRIM REAPER'S BOOK OF DAYS.
