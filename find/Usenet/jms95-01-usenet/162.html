<H2>ATTN JMS: What finally sold B5</H2>
26 Jan 1995<PRE>     What made all the difference was finding people who *understood* what
we were trying to do.  In general, you know instantly if an exec Gets It or
not.  Most didn't.  The first one to Get It was Evan Thompson, head of
Chris-Craft Television, who put us onto Dick Robertson at Warner Bros.
We didn't know at the time that PTEN was in the works (a joint venture
between the two), but when it appeared, we were in line to get on.
 
     We did multiple pitches to the station group's executive committee,
and were pleased to see that they, too, Got It.  Once we proved that we
could a) do the pilot, and b) do it for the budget, we got the Go for
series.
