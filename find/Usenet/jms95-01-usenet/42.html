<H2>Re: - JMS on Patrick Stewart</H2>
11 Jan 1995<PRE>     BTW, just as a switch-back to the original thread here...might
intest folks to know that Michael O'Hare was invited by some of Patrick's
Fan Club Members to see "A Christmas Carol," Stewart's reading, went
backstage, met Patrick...and was subsequently invited to make an
appearance at a local meeting of Stewart's fan club, where he was invited
to come up on stage by Stewart, where the two shook hands and lots of
photos were taken.
 
     (At a recent convention, btw, Michael and Avery Brooks hung out
together, had drinks, and discussed the hassles of being the commander
of a space station....)
