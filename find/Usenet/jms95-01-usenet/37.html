8 Jan 1995<PRE>     This to Frank Springall...we weren't *talking* about shows from
other countries.  We were addressing American-produced shows.  Yes, we
could drag Dr. Who in here, but that's not really the *point*.  Doesn't
mean that nothing produced outside the US is "interesting."  Obviously it
is.  But that's simply not relevant to our discussion of the American
television series, and how studios and networks *here* view the genre.
