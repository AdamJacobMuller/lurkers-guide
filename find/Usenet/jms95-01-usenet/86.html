<H2>ATTN JMS: UK con appearance</H2>
18 Jan 1995<PRE>      Unfortunately I don't have the info on the UK con in April in
front of me, it's at the office.  I can remember such things for only
about 20 minutes when my brain seizes up and flushes the info.  There
have been inquiries about attending the Wolf 359 convention later in
the year, but thus far I've heard nothing formal from the convention, or
specifics on how this would be worked out.  Be assured that there will
probably be lots of info on this other con well before the April event
(I keep thinking it's not far from Stratford-upon-Avon...).
