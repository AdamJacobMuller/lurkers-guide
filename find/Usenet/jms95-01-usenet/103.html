20 Jan 1995<PRE>     "If memory serves, this is the first real praise (jms) has for ST.
I think he is gaining real confidence about his own show."
 
     I think you're trying to connect two unrelated things.  1) I have
always had confidence in my own show, or I wouldn' be here.  2) Up until
now, minus some good things in TNG, there hasn't been very much noteworthy
(imo) *about* ST that I could say.  Now there is.
