<H2>"Shadows" request from jms</H2>
27 Jan 1995<PRE>     A request for those who'll be seeing "The Coming of Shadows" on the
satellite uplink tomorrow.  There's a lot of stuff in that episode, and
it's probably the best one of the series to date.  It has a lot of sudden
twists and turns that even "WARNING: SPOILER" in message headers won't
keep from accidentally spilling out.
 
     Thus, I'd like to make a request I don't generally make: if those
who get the satellite feed could hold off on ANY plot revelations for a
few days, until it starts airing, I would *very* much appreciate it.
After you've seen the ep, you'll understand why I ask this.  General
comments (liked it/hated it), or private email with questions or
responses...all terrific.  I'd just like to try and keep this one as
close to my vest as possible for a bit.
