<H2>Murder, He Wrote?  (Re JMS)</H2>
15 Jan 1995<PRE>     Correct; I was a writer/producer on MURDER, SHE WROTE for two years,
and wrote something like 10-12 episodes (I don't remember exac
offhand).  For the last 2 weeks or so, USA network has been hitting the
seasons I worked on, so my name has been there a lot lately.
