<H2>ATTN JMS: Future Quest</H2>
6 Jan 1995<PRE>     Basically, they asked if they could use our sets for a PBS program,
and we said sure.  Not much more to it than that; I think we allowed them
the use of our stages without rental charge, since it's a worthy cause.
They were allowed to choose which shots to use.  I wasn't in the show
because I wasn't asked to be.  Doesn't matter either way; ain't doing this
to get my mug on TeeVee.  The lawsuits over nationally induced cardiac
infarction ALONE would kill our budget....
