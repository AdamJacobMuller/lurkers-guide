<H2>Attn JMS: irony is our friend</H2>
20 Jan 1995<PRE>     Yeah, I don't doubt that Majel took some swipes at B5 (which show was
that, btw?).
 
     She's long been very frangible about the whole issue.  I think she
doesn't like having her monopoly in any way threatened.
 
     Here's an example of how Majel is, which can be confirmed by others
online who were there: when I went to debut the B5 pilot at Wishcon, she
had the presentation right before mine.  I had just under two hours to
show the pilot, with maybe fifteen minutes of intro and technical setup.
She was due to leave the stage at the top of the hour.
 
     After me, was scheduled the auction to raise money for terminally
ill children, the purpose of the whole con.  Remember that.
 
     So the top of the hour came.  Majel didn't surrender the stage.  Ten
minutes after.  Fifteen.  Twenty.  People began indicating for her to
leave.  She refused.  She looked in my direction, said, "I see him back
there, I know he's here," and kept *right* on talking.  And talking.
 
     Finally, round about the half-hour mark, she finally stopped.  So
now there was NO time for any discussion from me at all, and even if we
ran through the tech setup as fast as possible, we would still cut deep
into the auction.  It was a clear and obvious attempt to sabotage the
showing, in front of a couple hundred witnesses.  Though she has been
known to go a bit over from time to time at other cons, her reference to
me, and the length of the overage, clearly showed it was intentional.
 
     I told the convention people that I would be willing to only show the
first hour of the pilot (its first screening anywhere), maybe try to find
a time in the evening to show the rest.  They insisted: show the whole
thing, and we'll just take it out of the auction.  Nonetheless, I kept my
introductory comments as brief as possible, showed the pilot, and rather
than keep the room tied up longer, crammed everybody who wanted to talk
about it into a smaller room down the hall.
 
     Later, several people from the con confronted Majel with this, as
she was signing autographs.  They asked her point-blank if she'd done
this *deliberately* to try and screw B5.  She just smiled.  Didn't matter
that in the long run, her actions would just end up hurting the cause of
aiding terminally ill children.  Later, due to a lot of people being very
upset by her behavior, she offered to write a note apologizing.  Suffice
to say it was never written.
