<H2>ATTN JMS: Diplomacy questions</H2>
21 Jan 1995<PRE>     There are various embassies and diplomatic missions on various
worlds (Earth has the most; Universe Today had a story about a Minbari
embassy being bombed).  Because space on B5 is so tight, complete offices
for every single ambassador would kill most of the available space; so
they have access to the station's facilities for business rooms, meeting
rooms, conference rooms and the like.
