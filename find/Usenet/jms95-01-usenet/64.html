<H2>Release of series onto Laser d</H2>
15 Jan 1995<PRE>     We do hope to have the (widescreen) disks out by summer or fall, once
we finish re-transferring all the film stock back to its original format.
The pilot can't be released in a producers' cut since it never existed in
film, only in computer-image form on the Avid editing system.  To do the
full film would require completely re-editing the film and re-scoring, and
we don't have the resources or budget for that.
