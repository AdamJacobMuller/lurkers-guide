<H2>Re: Murder, He Wrote? (Re JMS)</H2>
15 Jan 1995<PRE>     We had one of the M,SW directors over recently, and he mentioned that
Angela, as with you, considers "The Committee" to be the best episode of
the series.  I'm inclined to agree that it was probably one of the best
scripts I did for the show, though I'm also particular toward "The Wind
Around the Tower" and parts of "Incident in Lot 7."
