<H2>Re: JMS: Season Four, the HUGO, and the WWWF Grudge Match</H2>
4 Oct 1996<PRE>"1)I've noticed that, according to the Lurker's Guide, you have written
the first eight episodes of season four.  Are you planning to write the
entire season?  I hope so.  Season three kicked ass.  I can only assume
that the Hugo must have revitalized your writing spirit."

It was a big help, no mistake.  
 
"2)How does it feel to be in a class of sci-fi writers that produced such
classics as Star Wars, Alien, 2001, and of course old Harlan's classic
Trek episode?"

Well, that kind of approbation is granted by time and time alone, not by
the person doing the work...if the show survives and thrives twenty years
from now, as is my hope, ask me again then.  Now, it would be presumptive
of me to do so.

"3)Did you get a chance to read the WWWF Grudge Match a few weeks ago?"

No....
