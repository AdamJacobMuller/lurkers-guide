<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Your health</H2>
27 Oct 1996<PRE>I eat fine, and in general am fine.  It's always a risk, though, going to
conventions, because the odds of catching something from 2000 people in
close quarters, with considerable contact is fairly high.  And the flu's
running around this season.  So I got hammered just at the end of the last
con I did in Tampa.  Probably caught it the first day of the con, 'cause
it hit by Sunday.  But them's the breaks.
