<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Suggestions for SF marathon?</H2>
27 Oct 1996<PRE>"I'm the SF Marathon Director for the MIT Lecture Series Committee, and
was just wondering what you, Joe, would recommend...  what are your
favorite SF movies of all time?"

For starters, I'd include "Seconds" on your list, the only marginally SF
film done by Rock Hudson which to this *day* scares the hell out of me. 
John Frankenheimer was never better.

I'd also include "Fail Safe," "Dr. Strangelove," "Seven Days in May" and
"The Manchurian Candidate" which (for my money) do have some SF aspects to
them...if "Alas, Babylon" is SF, then "Fail Safe" and the others can be
included in that.  It's also a grouping that gives newer audiences a sense
of where this country was at a very precarious point in its history.

Of films more definitely in the SF area...Forbidden Planet, The Day the
Earth Stood Still, Something Wicked This Way Comes, Invasion of the Body
Snatchers, The Rocky Horror Picture Show (stop staring at me like that,
it's got aliens and...and space ships...and...and mad scientists and stuff
like that, and it's got a beat and you can dance to it), Aliens, High
Plains Drifter (fantasy), Terminator 2, The Road Warrior, The Princess
Bride (fantasy), On the Beach, Night of the Living Dead, Brazil, Alien,
The Haunting of Hill House, Blade Runner, First Men in the Moon, When
Worlds Collide, Village of the Damned, Earth Vs. the Flying Saucers,
Phantom of the Paradise and Day of the Triffids.
