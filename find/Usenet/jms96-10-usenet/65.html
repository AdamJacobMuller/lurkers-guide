<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Anti-male joke ruined my enjoyment of Shadow Dancing (*SPOILERS*)</H2>
26 Oct 1996<PRE>"I gritted my teeth tighter when the dialogue launched into some anti-male
paranoia about "What if the male demands the female stay a second night?",
and the various "vengeances" she could take for a custom that is, after
all, steeply in her favor. I could accept all that in an anthropological
sense: "Look what anti-male customs the Minbari have. Isn't that
fascinating, if you put the moral judgements aside?". But then... Yeesh!"

The "vengeances" she cites, should the male insist she stay another night,
are "she can leave once he falls asleep, complain to the elders, even cut
off his access to her family."  These hardly sound like anti-male
rhetoric, but rather precautions taken to deal reasonably *should* someone
get out of line.  It doesn't state that all men do this, but sets in place
what to do should *some* men do this.

This is not a problem of context.  It is a problem of perception.  It has
nothing to do with the scene, and everything to do with how you perceive
the role of males in society.
