<H2>Re: Attn JMS: Shadow Dancing at Avalon (Spoilers)</H2>
25 Oct 1996<PRE>"When I saw "A Late Arrival at Avalon," Marcus's line asking "Who is
Morgana La Fey" got me to begin speculating that Anna Sheridan was alive
and that she was working for the Shadows.  My question is whether or not
Marcus's line was intended that way--i.e. as foreshadowing that a
significant female figure not presently on the scene (Anna?) would arrive
at B5 to play Morgana to Delenn's Lady of the Lake?"



yup.
