<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: ratings --- here's some.</H2>
26 Oct 1996<PRE>And here's some great info: I've mentioned that we've been consistently
growing in ratings, and the second episode back, "Grey 17," hit #19 in the
ratings, so we're back in the top 20 for the first time in quite a while!

I've mentioned before the slow upward tracking, from 60s to 50s to 40s,
and then to 30s...and now we're right smack into the top 20 (as per this
past Friday's Daily Variety).  We're very pleased.
