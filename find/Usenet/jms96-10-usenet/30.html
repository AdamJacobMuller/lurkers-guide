<H2>jms in Tampa, also jms book</H2>
10 Oct 1996<PRE>Two quickies....

1) This weekend, 11-13th, I'll be in Tampa Florida for Necronomicon, a
convention being held at the Chamberly Plaza Hotel/Convention Center. 
I'll be bringing the bloopers, some clips from as-yet unaired shows, and
other goodies.

2) My totally rewritten, updated and expanded "Complete Book of
Scriptwriting" hits the stands this week in hardback, $21.99, from
Writer's Digest Books (ISBN 0-8987-9-512-5).  The book can be found at
stores, and you can pick up any copy of Writer's Digest Magazine and order
from them via their 800 number (which I don't have at hand, alas).
