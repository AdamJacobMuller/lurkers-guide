Lemme put it to you this way, Neely.

If someone pointed to an aggressor city (and for the shadows there's no
distinction between civilian and military, it's all the same, the only
thing that drives them on), which was unified by its desire to wreak havoc
and commit massive warfare, and said, "By eliminating that city of 100,000
agressors you will save the lives of 8 billion innocent bystanders," I'd
push that button in a hot second, and never regret it.
