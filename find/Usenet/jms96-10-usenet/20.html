7 Oct 1996<PRE>"By "incident", I meant perhaps a Roddenberry-esque communication
breakdown between producer and writer"

No, I get along with me fairly well most days...someone has to.  Of
course, there are some days I won't talk to me, stalk out of the room
whenever I walk in, and there was that time I locked me in the closet
until I forced me to finish a script, the embarrassing moment when we both
showed up for a meeting dressed in the same chiffon number and answering
to the name Dorothy...but other than that, no, no noteworthy incidents to
report.
