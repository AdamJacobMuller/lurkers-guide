<H2>jms scriptwriting book info</H2>
21 Oct 1996<PRE>(This is the last time I'll be forwarding this info for a while; I got
requests from several nets for more info, since the prior notice was
fairly brief, and now that I have a minute to spare, I'm passing it along,
but I don't want to monopolize this overmuch with what is, in essence, a
commercial....)

As I mentioned in my earlier note, bundled with the Tampa convention info,
the new edition of my book, "The Complete Book of Scriptwriting," has just
come out from Writer's Digest Books.  

It has chapters on breaking in as a writer for film, TV, stage and radio,
which have been rewritten stem to stern from the prior edition, fully
updated, old info trashed, again completely revised...plus new chapters on
animation, the Writer's Guild, Warning Signs, altogether about 100,000 new
words.  (The book is huge, 424 pages, one stop shopping for the
script-inclined.)  It's basically the book I wish someone had written when
*I* was starting out in the biz.

It also contains the *complete* script for the Hugo-award winning B5
episode, "The Coming of Shadows," with material deleted from the actual
episode for time.

You can order the book via your local bookstore (ISBN# 0-89879-512-5), or
via www.amazon.com, or direct from WD (800-289-0963).  It sells for $21.99
in hardback.  

It took me about 3+ years to finish the rewrite on this, because I wanted
it to be right.  Now it is.
