<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Inside the mind of the Great Maker</H2>
15 Oct 1996<PRE>Thanks.  It's the sort of book -- a retrospective -- that would be useful,
I agree.  On the one hand, I'm not sure I'd be up to writing it right
after finishing the series; I think I'll probably be off in a coma
somewhere.  But if I wait too long, some details will get lost.  I think
I'll have to think about this some more....
