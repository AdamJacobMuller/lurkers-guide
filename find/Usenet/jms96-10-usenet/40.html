<H2>Re: Sci-Fi Universe Awards-Congrats to Mira Furlan &amp; Peter Jurasik</H2>
20 Oct 1996<PRE>Peter Jurasik won for Best Supporting Actor, and Bruce won for Best Actor.

The web site got it wrong; B5 won for Best Series, not X-Files...an error
which was repeated onstage, as one of the presenters read the name
X-Files, which was on the prompter, even though the card in his hand read
B5.  This led to a very embarrassing moment for a poor X-Files fellow who
went up there to accept, only to have it taken away.  

Mira, btw, was never notified of her nomination, or invited to the awards.
