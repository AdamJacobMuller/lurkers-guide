<H2>Re: ATTN JMS AND ALL: Interesting article in Chicago Tribune</H2>
9 Oct 1996<PRE>Re: places where B5 isn't mentioned and should be...here's another, which
came out this week, and it's hit that point now where I just have to
laugh....

The current issue of Cinefantastique has a whole two or three page article
about how Voyager is now using story arcs across episodes.  They consider
it a new kind of storytelling for them, but cite the notion that it *has*
been used here and there.  The magazine (not the folks at the show)
enumerate such examples as Hill Street Blues, NYPD Blue, LA Law...of which
2 out of 3 shows are no longer on the air...but what's the one they
*don't* mention?  The only one really doing this in SF until lately?

Yup.  I think the magazine deliberately pre-censored themselves on this,
because they suspect that the folks at Paramount grind their gears bigtime
if B5 is EVER mentioned as in any way having an influence on their shows. 


Here's JMS's rule of journalism, which you'll see repeated in 90% of the
articles on SF out there: if it's an article on B5, ST is almost always
mentioned somewhere; if it's an article on ST, you almost *never* see B5
mentioned.
