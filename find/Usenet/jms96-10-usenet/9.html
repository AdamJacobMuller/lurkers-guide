<H2>Re: Review of OTHERSYDE by J. Michael Straczynski</H2>
2 Oct 1996<PRE>I think I pretty much agree with the comments, criticisms inclusive. 
OtherSyde was my second novel, and I was still learning my craft, so it
has some rough edges, though overall I think it works.  

Re: some dangling threads and a hurried sense to the last third...again, I
agree.  The book was about 100 pages over what the publisher decided what
he wanted to put out, and sliced off a lot of threads, and hurried a lot
of the other stuff.  Which is one reason why I haven't let the book be
reprinted since; I'd prefer to go to the longer version...and I'm
embarrassed to say I don't know where the draft is.  (Or the files.)  I
think the longer version worked a lot better.
