<H2>Re: Walkabout question (spoiler for Walkabout)</H2>
6 Oct 1996<PRE>In "Severed Dreams," the dilemma faced by the Alexander in the teaser is
that if they jump, they'll end up leaving their fighters behind.  A jump
engine rips the area open for that one ship, and closes it again right
behind it.  What sometimes happens, as in "All Alone," is that *as a ship
comes out*, it releases its fighters.  But you can't just follow a ship
into a jump point formed by another ship.  You'd probably get torn apart
when space folded back on you, because the field opening the point is
primarily around the other ship.
