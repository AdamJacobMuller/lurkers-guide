25 Oct 1996<PRE>We're limited to what WB has in stock; WB only sends a photographer to the
set 1 day out of every 7 we shoot.  They usually send someone on days when
there are action sequences.  So very often, guest stars don't get shot. 
The Fleer folks have to make do with what WB chooses to shoot.
