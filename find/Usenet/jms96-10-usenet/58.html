<H2>Re: SHADOW DANCING (spoilers)</H2>
25 Oct 1996<PRE>&gt;...and the BIGGEST bitch of all about the episode (and JMS - pay
&gt;attention) was the "miraculous" recovery of Marcus. I like him as a
&gt;character, and enjoyed the further development of his unrequited love
&gt;for Ivanova (along the Lancelot/Gueniviere parallel). But, two
&gt;episodes ago, he had the freaking SHIT beat out of him (remember the
&gt;bloody Minbari staff anyone???).

Yes, I do remember.  But for starters, we're talking about more than two
weeks of story time.  Between Grey 17 and Rock was several weeks, then
you've got about 2 weeks from Rock to Shadow Dancing.  That's five weeks,
and now you've got the issue of medicine 250 years from now...and you can
be sure that these kinds of injuries will be fixed much more quickly.  It
isn't like he showed up the very next day like this, we *did* allow for
proper amounts of time.
