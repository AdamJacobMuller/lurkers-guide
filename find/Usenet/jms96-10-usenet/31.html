15 Oct 1996<PRE>RE: the notion of seeing a boat on a lake in the central Garden area...the
reason I didn't want to do it was that it's silly.  It stretched credulity
enough to show the baseball diamond (which I've since never returned to,
for that very reason), but to waste water and space like that in a
confined location like B5, which is always short, and needs everything to
be somewhat functional, struck me as a Foolish Thing.  The whole idea here
is that they're under stress, locked in a tin can.  To do a scene like
this would undercut that.  Would it look cool?  Sure.  Would it be right
for the story?  No.
