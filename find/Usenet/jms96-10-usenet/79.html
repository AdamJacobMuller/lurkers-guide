<H2>402 Spoiler Warning</H2>
29 Oct 1996<PRE>I just got a copy of the ad that's going to run in TV Guide for "Whatever
Happened to Mr. Garibaldi?" in two weeks.  It's a great ad, well composed,
well done, but it's also a major spoiler for something you will NOT want
spoiled.  So avoid the ad if possible.
