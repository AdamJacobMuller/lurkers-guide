<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: When the writer's block cometh..</H2>
31 Oct 1996<PRE>"What I want to know is, when the muses fly away and bring the dreaded
monster of writer's block on you, how do YOU deal with it?"

You're going to kill me when you hear this...but since I started writing
and selling at 17, I've never, ever had writer's block.  It's finding time
to write it all, and deciding which thing to write, that's always been
hard.  But (not to tempt the universe here), I've never had writer's
block, and can't imagine it.  Even if it ever did hit, I've got so much
outlined and premise'd out in the files I could work off that for
literally *years*.
