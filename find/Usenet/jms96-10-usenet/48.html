22 Oct 1996<PRE>By not mentioning it, now you're mentioning it, so to get something
mentioned maybe it's better not to mention it, or mention not mentioning
it, or by not mentioning that you've not mentioned it let someeone else
mention that you've not mentioned it.

By the time you finish the preceding sentence, the word "mention" will
have lost all meaning.

And we'll get back to this issue in season 4.
