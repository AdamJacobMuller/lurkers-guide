1 Oct 1996<PRE>John Copeland is a producer on the show, a line producer (technical term).
 Problem is, he's only on AOL.  I try to direct people to the right areas
in general terms -- if there's a fan club question, go to Jim Lockett at
jplb5@aol.com, for instance -- but basically, I'm here, and if a question
comes my way, I kinda have to answer it because there's nobody else here
to do it.
