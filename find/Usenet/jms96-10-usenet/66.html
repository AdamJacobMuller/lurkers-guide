26 Oct 1996<PRE>We've been running this down, and we suspect that the tapes are being
transmuted from digital to analog and back again when they insert the
commercials after we turn over the eps to WB.  We're working to fix this,
it happened before and we beat the crap outta some people at the
subcontracting company.  We may have to do it again.
