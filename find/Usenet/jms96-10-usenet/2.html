1 Oct 1996<PRE>"Do you think that you write at both the conscious and subconscious level
simultaneously."

I think any writer has to operate at both levels at the same time.  You
learn to trust your instincts.  There's a certain point when you're "in
the zone," to use a sports phrase, and the logical part of you is
structuring the plot, and the illogical, intuitive part of you is filling
in the corners.  You have to be open to both voices for it to work.
