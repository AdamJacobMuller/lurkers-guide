<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Art of Screenwriting</H2>
9 Oct 1996<PRE>The script which, I hope, WB has included, for "The Coming of Shadows," is
written exactly the same way I write *all* my scripts, whether for B5 or
Murder, She Wrote or any other series.  And there's really no one way to
do this, which is something I make clear in the book...you find the style
that works for you.  I've seen, and bought, scripts that were very spare
when it came to camera stuff, and scripts that were chockablock with them.
 Ain't no one answer in this business.
