1 Oct 1996<PRE>Basically, nobody sees anything until it's in first draft form.  Harlan
functions on an as-needed basis; if I have a question, or if there's an
area which could benefit from his input, I call him in, but for the most
part, the scriptwriting is a one-person affair.  The job of the writer is
to listen to the small voice in the back of his head, and too often too
many voices just get in the way.
