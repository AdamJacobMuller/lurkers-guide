<H2>Re: "ATTN JMS:A ratings question"</H2>
24 Oct 1996<PRE>No, nothing new, and I'm really kinda bugged about it.  Because of the
TNT/WB merger, most of our people over at WB who used to give us the
ratings aren't there anymore or have been shifted over to other
divisions...they don't like taking the time to give each individual show
they work on the ratings breakdown because it takes up too much of their
time.  

The only figure I've heard so far was the overall national (final) rating
on the first new episode, which was a 3.2, which is great for coming back.
 The station by station figures I've seen for the second week are higher,
so the overall should be higher, but until they see fit to tell me, I can
only guess, and the trades don't usually publish comprehensive lists.
