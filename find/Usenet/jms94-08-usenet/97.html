<H2>A note regarding "V" to jms</H2>
30 Aug 1994<PRE>     I guess my attitude toward "V" the series (as distinguished from
the miniseries, which was great) is colored by the rather contemptuous
attitude of the producers toward SF, and SF fans, leading to their
decision to bring on soap opera writers.  I think they took a wonderful
concept and just trashed it.
