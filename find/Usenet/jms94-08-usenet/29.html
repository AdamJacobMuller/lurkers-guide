<H2>JMS: Any new sets for season 2</H2>
10 Aug 1994<PRE>     We've done a lot of work on the sets; refurbished, made better, put
in windows that look out onto the Garden, expanded...and built some new
sets, including an officer's club, a Bazaar, and other sets.  We took a
blood oath: each year, bigger and better.
