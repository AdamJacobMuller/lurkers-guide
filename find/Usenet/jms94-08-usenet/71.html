<H2>JMS: 2nd season writing proces</H2>
25 Aug 1994<PRE>     It's impossible not to have the characters change to varying degrees
once you cast actors to play them.  Gradually, Mira's personality has
grown into Delenn, Andreas has added a lot to G'Kar, Garibaldi IS Doyle,
and Boxleitner is bringing a lot to Sheridan.  You get to hear the
characters' voices more the deeper you go, season-wise, and that's great.
