<H2>JMS: Are You Going to Con</H2>
2 Aug 1994<PRE>     Eric...nothing would gladden my heart more than if the B5 pilot
won a Hugo (except the series winning a Hugo, which I think is a bit
likelier, maybe).  It is the highest compliment that can be paid by the
SF community of readers and viewers.  But one must be realistic, and I
just don't see it outpulling Jurassic Park in the ballotting.  JP is the
proverbial 500 pound gorilla.  Or the 50,000 pound T-Rex.
 
     While we are only small mammals....granted we're mammals with guns
and an attitude, of course....
