<H2>Re: Creation's False B5 info</H2>
10 Aug 1994<PRE>     It's my understanding that the "information" about O'Hare was fed to
Creation by -- big surprise -- someone associated with Paramount/ST.  You
know, they could save themselves *endless* embarrassment (particularly in
the "York is new commander" kind of situation, which caused them to send
letters/faxes to all their "hosts") if they would, oh I dunno...maybe CALL
US for information rather than taking stuff off the grapevine, particularly
from anyone with Paramount.
 
     (I've also heard just recently that allegedly Paramount is leaning on
those who've directed ST episodes, who are free agents and not under any
kind of general contract, *not* to direct B5.  We've already had one such
incident of withdrawl after we'd made arrangements and all parties had
agreed to the director doing an episode for us.)
 
                                                                        jms
