<H2>JMS and the net</H2>
16 Aug 1994<PRE>     Best thing about the net is that it forces you to ask questions.  The
job of the writer is to come up with every possible question about your
character and your world, and answer it, giving both greater
verasimilitude.  But nobody can come up with EVERY conceivable question;
but on the nets, you get questions you never *dreamed* of.  Which helps.
