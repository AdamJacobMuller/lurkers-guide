<H2>Creation's False B5 info</H2>
8 Aug 1994<PRE>     The speakers at Creation have a habit of running their mouths when
they don't have a clue what the facts are.  I've already had to yell at
them once in the last couple weeks, stating that Michael York had been
selected as the new Commander.  Now this.  Frankly, I wouldn't believe a
word they say about *anything*.
