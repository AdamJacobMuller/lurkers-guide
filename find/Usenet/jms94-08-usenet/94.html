<H2>JMS: Speaking of First Comics.</H2>
30 Aug 1994<PRE>     I would *love* to do American Flagg! as a movie; I think it was
probably Howard's best moment.  I've read a lot of his stuff, but somehow
after AF! it never did it for me as much as that one did.  (And he
certainly went...well, let's say where no comic has gone before...in Black
Kiss.)  I think the rights might be tied up, however.
