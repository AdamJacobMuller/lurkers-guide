<H2>Re: Plaster-cast of G'Kar.</H2>
10 Aug 1994<PRE>     The plaster bust of G'Kar stolen from the B5 offices right before we
began shooting Year One is still missing.  And again, if this ever shows
up at a dealer's room, know that it is stolen merchandise and there is a
police report listing it as such.
 
     Anyone buying this will be buying stolen merchandise.
