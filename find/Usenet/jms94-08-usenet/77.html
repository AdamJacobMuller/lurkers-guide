<H2>JMS: Some comments on your "no</H2>
28 Aug 1994<PRE>     Actually, there are varying religions within the alien species as
well; G'Kar is a follower of G'Quan, while Na'Toth's father followed
G'Lan, and Na'Toth herself doesn't really believe in anything (this as
noted in "By Any Means Necessary").  So that diversity isn't strictly or
exclusively human.
