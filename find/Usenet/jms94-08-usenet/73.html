27 Aug 1994<PRE>     Michael Heser...I don't just respond to flame-bait.  I respond to
something on the order of 100 messages a day, out of the 500 per day that
I get.  In this one pass on Internet via my GEnie mailbox, I've just
written about 15 so far, and I've got a bunch more to go through.  (And
not one was a flame.)  This is an aberration, nothing more, and I do
reserve the right to plink somebody upside the nose if he gets
obnoxious.  The occasional aberration is good for you (now if only I could
convince my wife of that...).
