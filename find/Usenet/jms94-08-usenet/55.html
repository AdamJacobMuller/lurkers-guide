<H2>"Mercy" -- SPOILERS of course</H2>
19 Aug 1994<PRE>     They cannot carry out the original sentence because the body is
now dead, which would tend to diminish its social acceptability.

     Dr. Franklin did not know that Mueller had yet found Rosen, or even
knew of it.  There are no Babcom systems in DownBelow quarters.  To send
a security team, when they're out searching, without cause, is neither
realistic nor sensible.  He did the correct thing: to go and warn her,
while at the same time making sure that security knew where he was going,
and if they didn't hear anything, to send in a team.

                                                                      jms
