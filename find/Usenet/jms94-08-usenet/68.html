<H2>Re: [B5] Liar liar pants on fi</H2>
25 Aug 1994<PRE>     Morgan...there is a quantum difference between being called a liar,
and receiving criticism on a story.  If you cannot see that, that is your
problem, not mine.
 
     "If it wasn't worth your time, then why did you respond?"
 
     Because I felt like it.  However, to the rest of your points, which
are specious and irrelevant, I don't feel like it tonight.  I will instead
go along with your question, "why respond?"
 
     Good suggestion.
 
     Particularly when applied to your message.
