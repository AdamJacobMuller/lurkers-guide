<H2>JMS: 'What do you want?' - nod</H2>
29 Aug 1994<PRE>     Actually, the origin of "What do you want?" comes from encounter
groups I've run, and from other kinds of group psychotherapy, such as the
original Synanon games; you ask, "Who are you?" over and over, refusing
to take the same answer twice, to peel away the fabric of what the
person is.  It's a slight jump to "What do you want?"  (I knew that
degree in Psychology would come in handy one of these days.)
 
     As for the B5 reference in "OtherSyde," I always knew it would be a
series, because I've never allowed any other consideration.
 
     (I think B5 hits Australia later in the fall.)
