<H2>JMS: Musical Themes?</H2>
26 Aug 1994<PRE>     We've done a lot with themes over the season, and plan to do more,
developing themes for all our characters.  I like interpolating bits and
pieces of the B5 theme into parts of the show; the lower-key version at
the end of "Signs" has always struck me as very effective.

(meant to type "minor key."
