<H2>?? for Joe (B^^2 SPOILERS)      [G's flashback seeing Lise]</H2>
10 Aug 1994<PRE>     The two flashbacks were designed so that they could run in any order
(something you have to consider in syndication).  You get a slightly
different "feel" from seeing them in a different order, but it still works.
