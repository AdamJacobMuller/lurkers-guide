<H2>JMS: How many eps?</H2>
28 Aug 1994<PRE>     This is from memory, but after we broke down the stories for the
second season, and determined who we'd need for what stories, I think it
came out to 22 each for Sheridan, Ivanova, Garibaldi, Delenn and
Franklin; 13 for Na'Toth, Vir, Talia, G'Kar and Londo; and 8 for our new
squadron leader.  (Oops, forgot 13 also for Lennier.)  Now these are the
minimum contracted for, we can use them for more as they're needed.
