<H2>JMS: Don't do it!!!!!</H2>
18 Aug 1994<PRE>     I'm trying to make the B5 novels and comics as much canon as I can.
Basically, they take place within B5 continuity, as episodes that might
have been.  The first four issues of the comic deal with issues that hit
the series, but from another point of view/location.  The novel uses B5
as background of an event that makes sense within B5 continuity, and may
be referred to in future episodes (not as a requirement, but only as
background...no different than when you have to give background on any
episode of stuff that's happened in the past, like Ironheart's escape,
for instance, which we don't have to see/read about, but knowing is nice).

     I *really* don't want these to be just throwaways media-tie-ins.  I
want them to stand on their own as good work, *and* be part of our
universe.

     Thankfully, I no longer require sleep, and have transcended to a
higher state of consciousness...ommmmmm....

                                                                     jms
