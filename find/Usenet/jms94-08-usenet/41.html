<H2>JMS: A few minor questions...</H2>
14 Aug 1994<PRE>     Promoting Ivanova to running the station would not be logical, since
from a military and diplomatic standpoint she has nowhere *near* the level
of experience required.  It wouldn't be done in real life.
 
     G'Kar wasn't needed for the last few eps; he'll show up again in
"Chrysalis," and a lot next season.
 
     I think there'll be a tech manual eventually.
