<H2>JMS: Dirt on the Lens!!! (Mini</H2>
2 Aug 1994<PRE>     My suspicion is that the shows are sent to the UK via parcel, not
via satellite, but that's only an assumption.
 
     Won't be starting production formally until August 10th.  Gearing
up now.
 
     Re: satellite...one of the more interesting stories I've heard lately
is that B5 is *very* popular via satellite...in Iran and Iraq, both of
whom lay claim of one sort or another to the original Babylon.  Apparently
that a Westerner has set a series in their well-remembered Babylon that
is NOT a negative thing but a positive thing has got both countries quite
pleasantly astonished.
