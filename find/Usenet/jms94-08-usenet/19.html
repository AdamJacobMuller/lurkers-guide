<H2>JMS: IS BACK! Questions!</H2>
8 Aug 1994<PRE>     Sheridan wasn't on the Line.  Have several options for his middle
name, haven't decided which to use yet.  Chrysalis is still for October.
And we've got plenty of scripts on hand currently; we wanted the same as
last year, 6, in hand when we began shooting.  We've got that.
