<H2>JMS:  LENN? and Comments</H2>
12 Aug 1994<PRE>     Re: Delenn/Lennier...there are certain recurring composites and
word-segments that show up frequently in Minbari language (as in Rathenn,
mentioned in "Voice 1," which resonates with Delenn).  I've worked out a
system for this, though it's probably not as complex as it should be.
 
     And thanks for your kind words.
