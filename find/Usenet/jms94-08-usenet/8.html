<H2>JMS: "Free Mars" in "A Voice i</H2>
2 Aug 1994<PRE>     Re: was the Free Mars movement a nod to Kim Stanley Robinson's
Mars books....
 
     I take your question as polite, and supportive, and genuinely
curious, and so I answer back: no, the thread was nowhere tied to Kim's
work.  Rather it grew out of a sense of history, looking at the tradition
of colonies to outgrow their founders, and want to strike out on their
own.  The United Kingdom being a good example of this.
 
     Having now answered politely, I return to my closet to stick very
long needles into my eyes....
 
                                                                        jms
 
     (Nothing to do with you, just the tenor of the day and messages
preceding.)
