<H2>B5 Writing, following a master</H2>
12 Aug 1994<PRE>     It is *all* designed to tie together.  Nothing is just tossed in
arbitrarily.  Again, the best comparison is a novel.  The few freelance
writers on the show (I wrote 12 last season) are given specific guidelines
on what to include to tie stuff together later.
