<H2>JMS: Warners' Wishlist</H2>
28 Aug 1994<PRE>     I don't recall ever mentioning any memo from PTEN "suggesting that
something be done with the commander or year two, even if just a bunch of
commander-centered episodes."  Warners/PTEN said that they would like to
see a bit more character-oriented stories, which was jake by me because
that's what we were aiming for anyway.  By virtue of being at least
nominally an action/adventure show, there was always some sense that we
had to have a lot of running around; now they're giving us the freedom to
have more latitude, which by me is terrific.  They've given us no other
notes.
