<H2>What if a crucial actor/actres</H2>
20 Aug 1994<PRE>     No, that sort of thing can't be done on an episodic TV budget; when
time comes to do the flip side of Bsquared, we'll integrate the first
season footage, but the second part hasn't yet been shot.

                                                                       jms
