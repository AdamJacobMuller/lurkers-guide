<H2>JMS: Na'Toth casting?</H2>
20 Aug 1994<PRE>     The woman who will be playing Na'Toth next season is Mary Kay Adams;
we're introducing a character who will be a Squad Leader for Zeta
Squadron (the one that arrived in "Survivors"), Warren Keffer, which will
be portrayed by Robert Russler.  (Many people noted that logically you
would have a regular squad leader as well as in some situations the
Commander going out, and most times it's the Squad Leader who's out there
doing this kind of stuff.  And they're correct.)
