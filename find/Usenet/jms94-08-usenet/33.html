<H2>&gt; &gt; JMS &amp; All:  Worldcon B5 pa</H2>
11 Aug 1994<PRE>     My replies, for the panel, in brief:
 
     What works? What doesn't?  (Most things, some things.)
 
     Can B5 become another Star Trek? (God I hope not.)
 
     Succumb to second season syndrome?  (Year 2 scripts even better.)
 
     B5 reflect politics of the 90s?  (No.  I hate the politics of the 90s.)
 
     Survive its 5 year story?  (That's up to you.)
 
     How handle the inevitable B5/ST comparisons?  (They're not
inevitable.  They're inevitable only if you choose to make them so. )
 
     Action/Character/Special EFX vs. good writing.  (Action and
character are part of good writing, you don't separate them.  EFX must
be in the  service of the story.)
 
     Comparisons with X-Files.  (See above.)
 
     TV SF's "last best hope."  (Only if you've learned that the
universe will implode in 4 years.)
 
     Why like/dislike it?  ("If you like that sort of thing, it's the
sort of thing you'll like."  Abraham Lincoln.)
 
     Plot or SFX more important?  (Neither.  Character first.  Then
plot.  Then SFX.)
 
     Why human female characters still 2-dimensional?  (Don't agree with
the premise.  They're not.  Are you still beating your wife?)
 
                                                                        jms
