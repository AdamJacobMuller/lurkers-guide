<H2>A message to jms</H2>
21 Aug 1994<PRE>     Thanks.  All of us involved in Babylon 5 work very hard at it, and
your words of encouragement are a great help.

     As an aside...the first season isn't *quite* over.  Our final
episode, "Chrysalis," will be aired the week before the second season
proper begins, figure the last Wednesday or so in October.

     I think you'll find it most intriguing....

                                                                          jms

</PRE>
