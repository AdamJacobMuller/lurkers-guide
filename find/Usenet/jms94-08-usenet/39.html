14 Aug 1994<PRE>     I've decided youze guys are just messing with my mind.
 
     Returning the favor, so to speak.
 
     It's certainly been that kind of week...first a file vanishes on my
computer, we need to print it, and it's gone...then I can see it again,
no explanation...I get a messengered packet from Chris Franke, expecting
it contains a tape, but it's flat and soft and I peek inside and I don't
see a tape and toss it, wondering what he's up to now...the coffee machine
isn't working right...everybody's messing with me, so why not here?
 
                                                                        jms
