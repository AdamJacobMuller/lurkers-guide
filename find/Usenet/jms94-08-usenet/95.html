<H2>JMS: Arcane story twists et al</H2>
30 Aug 1994<PRE>     If you look at my scripts, you'll find that generally I write very
tight, I don't leave a lot of threads hanging as a rule.  Same with the
planned series.  No important threads will be left hanging by the end of
it all.  And generally any really significant thread will be wrapped within
a year of being introduced.
