<H2>ATTN JMS: A few questions</H2>
31 Aug 1994<PRE>     The script called for Garibaldi to take up the Big Massive Gun and
fire, with a primal YELL that went on forever.  Any dialogue at that
point which replaced the yell came from the actor.  The "you're already
dead" was only relevant to the scene, not T2.
