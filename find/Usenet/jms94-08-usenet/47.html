16 Aug 1994<PRE>     Okay, okay, okay, hold off the frantic email...I WUZ ONLY KIDDING!
 
     I got the card from everybody, and I thank you for it.  It was a
wonderful gesture.  But I *had* to get back at y'all for the weeks of
grief leading up to it, yes?
 
     Thanks.  Really.
 
     And don't do it again.
