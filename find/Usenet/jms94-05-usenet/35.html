<H2>Shadows of Shadowmen (spoilers</H2>
20 May 1994<PRE>     Since you've done such a great job of speculating, I give you a
gift...a preview of something.

     There's an upcoming episode with Delenn going to the Grey Council.
As she joins the circle, in her Grey Council robes, she says, "In Valen's
name, I take the place that has been prepared for me.  I am Grey; I stand
between the candle, and the star.  We are Grey; we stand between the
Darkness, and the Light."
