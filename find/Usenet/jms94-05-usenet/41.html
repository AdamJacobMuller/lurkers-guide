<H2>The same launching shots</H2>
21 May 1994<PRE>     I tend to agree re: the launching shots.  There were going to be som
(some) new ones for S&amp;P, but there were SO many new shots in that one that
we just ran out of rendering time.  There's some new ones coming, though,
and very dramatic looking, in "Babylon Squared" and the two-parter.

                                                                         jms
