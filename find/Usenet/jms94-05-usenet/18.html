<H2>Re: Egotistical Producer</H2>
16 May 1994<PRE>     The name of General Netter was stuck in as a tweak to Doug, it's a
tuckerism (for those who know the term).  We've done it a bit here and
there; I kinda started shutting the process down after a while, since it
was getting carried away.  I don't want it to be obtrusive.

                                                                  jms
