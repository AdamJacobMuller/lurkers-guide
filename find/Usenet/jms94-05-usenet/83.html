<H2>JMS: TKO/Sitting Shiva</H2>
31 May 1994<PRE>     I'm very glad to see your note, and know that the story has had its
desired impact.  The passing of close family is the most traumatic thing
we can endure, and it must be faced with honesty and tenderness and the
willingness to forgive, and mourn, and go on with life with a clear
soul.  Good luck to you and yours as you gather.
