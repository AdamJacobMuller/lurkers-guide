21 May 1994<PRE>    Just to clarify again, this was a *mutual* decision.  There are some
VERY interesting things that we can do if we take an extended hiatus from
Sinclair aboard B5 (while keeping his character alive elsewhere) that we
wanted to explore, and Michael had some thoughts of his own.

                                                                      jms
