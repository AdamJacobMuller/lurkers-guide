26 May 1994<PRE>     So far working on season two: me, Larry DiTillio, DC Fontana, and
Harlan's turning his attention to his script.  Will be farming out some
others as we go.  Will probably write for year two about what I wrote
for this season, 12 or so.

                                                                       jms
