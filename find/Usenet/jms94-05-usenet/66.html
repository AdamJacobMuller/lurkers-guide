<H2>Re: All good things... STUPID!</H2>
26 May 1994<PRE>     Waitasec...you're saying that the shot where the later Enterprise
comes upward into frame and blasts the Klingon ship...that was CGI?  Are
you *sure*?  I didn't tape it, and was watching from across the room at
the time, so didn't notice.  If so I wanna know so I can go hammer some
geeks who said on another service they could tell CGI from models, and
they much preferred the models used in that shot.

     As for the finale...ehhh.  An omnipotent alien tests a human to see
if the human race is worthwhile.  Seems to me we've seen that story on ST
a LOT.  And the time-bouncing to learn a lesson seemed awfully reminiscent
of the DS9 pilot.
