<H2>Re: RUMOR: Michael O'Hare (Sin</H2>
28 May 1994<PRE>     I have, to date, read something on the order of a dozen different
rumors about the reason for O'Hare's leaving...that Warners marketing
wanted him out, that he was offered the lead on Voyager, that this was
actually planned out from the start, that he quit, that we fired him...if
I were to deal with all of these, I'd be here all day.  Rumors are just
that: rumors.
