<H2>ATT:JMS  Filming schedule</H2>
4 May 1994<PRE>     Yes, all episodes have been filmed, and are in the can.  They have
all been edited.  Only two remain to be mixed (putting in the soundtrack
and sound effects), and that's it.  We're done.  Assuming we're picked
up, filming would begin around July 14 or so.  Some script work has been
started to give us a leg up on the season, one way or another.

     PTEN begins its year in January for reasons of its own selection.  It
is a PTEN artifact of choice.
