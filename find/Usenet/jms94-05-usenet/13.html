<H2>"By All Means Necessary" Minor</H2>
12 May 1994<PRE>     Exactly my point; there are differences between similar alien
groups (like the Narn) in culture, language and religion, with BAMN being
a good demonstration of the latter.  Which is why I could only shrug and
say "Wait" after people started hammering on me here about monolithic
alien religions after "Parliament."  We'd already filmed BAMN by then, so
I knew it was there.  That's one thing about this show that some have
found out...generally, what you'd like us to do, we've probably done or
are about to do (hence the many times, when I'm asked about something,
that we can just say, "Wait until X airs in 2 weeks" or somesush).

     Still dancing as fast as I can....
