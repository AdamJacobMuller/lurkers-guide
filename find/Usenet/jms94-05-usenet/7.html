<H2>TO JMS: being a Believer</H2>
3 May 1994<PRE>     The hardest thing in the world is to stand alone.  Your friends will
not understand, will resent you, will want you to just stop it and let
life go back to where it was.  But you have to follow the quiet turning
of your own considered conscience.  It's a hard road.  Good luck with it.

                                                                       jms
