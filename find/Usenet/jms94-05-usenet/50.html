<H2>RUMOR: Michael O'Hare (Sinclai</H2>
22 May 1994<PRE>     Yes, it's quite true.  And it was precipitated, in large measure, by
an in-house evaluation of the story, and where we stood, and what more we
could do to make the story tighter, more interesting, and bring in some
surprises.  Then followed our talks with Michael, who had some thoughts of
his own.  And this is not a total separation; there may well be some
sightings of Sinclair along the way from time to time....
