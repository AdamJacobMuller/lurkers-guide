<H2>O'Hare to ST Voyager???</H2>
28 May 1994<PRE>     I spoke to Michael O'Hare the other day about the Voyager rumor (one
of the many floating around), and he was *very* amused by the idea.
 
     BTW, this is one area that needs mentioning.  Michael and I do speak
frequently.  We'll probably have dinner with the Ellisons and him in the
next week or so.  And we'll be doing a little something that will involve
his character later this season.  This is, again, a fairly amicable
situation.
 
                                                                       jms
