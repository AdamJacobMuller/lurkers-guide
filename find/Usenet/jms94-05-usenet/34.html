<H2>"A" and "B" plots</H2>
20 May 1994<PRE>     We're very flexible when it comes to A, B and C stories.  Some of
our episodes, like "Survivors," are all A story, no B story at all.  Some
have A and B stories.  Some, like "The Quality of Mercy," have 3-4 stories
going on at once.

                                                                           jms
