<H2>JMS: a possible solution to "n</H2>
30 May 1994<PRE>     I appreciate your suggestion, but the safest way really is just to
stay clear in general as much as I can.  Most of my entries on the files
are time-stamped, and a few have been circulated, so there's a paper
trail.  I'm just trying to avoid specific story suggestions in public as
much as possible.
