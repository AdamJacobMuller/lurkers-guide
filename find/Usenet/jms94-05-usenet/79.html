<H2>E Con (ECONomics 101) &amp; JMS</H2>
30 May 1994<PRE>     We've tried very hard not to let the merchandising get out of hand.
I pretty much sat on it during our first season, and am now letting a few
things go, like the CDRom, the soundtrack, the comic, some novels, and a
few other things.  But this was never intended to be a *franchise*, and I
would really rather not see it become one.
