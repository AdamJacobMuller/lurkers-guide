<H2>JMS: Small Bit in S&amp;P</H2>
24 May 1994<PRE>     The reference was mainly just a bit of black humor, no greater
overtones or meaning than that.  I don't think it's fair to the audience
to use something as obscure as that as a plot element.

                                                                       jms
