<H2>Babylon 5 first episode error</H2>
19 May 1994<PRE>     Negative.  The error is yours.  Londo's nephew was *not* aboard the
Raghesh 3 station.  He was on the planet below.  Check the credits; the
actors are different people.

                                                                       jms
