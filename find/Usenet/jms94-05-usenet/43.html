<H2>Re: Portents and Questions</H2>
21 May 1994<PRE>     "It has been divulged that Sinclair is coexisting in a parallel
dimension Babylon 4."

     Actually, this has *not* been divulged...what it is is a speculation
based on an offhand comment by Michael at a convention.  I jump in here
only because, well, that ain't it.  B4 is not in an alternate dimension,
neither is there an alternate Sinclair.  Just a course correction to the
discussion.

                                                                         jms
