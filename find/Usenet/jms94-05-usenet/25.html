17 May 1994<PRE>     The exchange, I believe, was:

     Sinclair: Lieutent Commander Ivanova, please escort Major Kemmer from
the Observation Dome.

     Ivanova: Certainly.  You will resist, I hope...?

     It's from "Survivors."

                                                                       jms
