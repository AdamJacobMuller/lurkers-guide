<H2>ATT: JMS PsiCops! (You are tri</H2>
21 May 1994<PRE>     Congratulations.  I was wondering when anyone was going to hit on
the CSICOP reference.  I was looking for a good name for the pit bulls of
the Psi Corps, and thought it made for a great play on words, and a very
obscure almost-pun, to name them Psi-Cops.

     I'm afraid you don't win a toaster, but a definite nod from deep
inside Babylon 5.
