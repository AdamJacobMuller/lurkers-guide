<H2>Starfury merchandising (ATTN:</H2>
23 May 1994<PRE>     Galoob will do some limited toys, don't know if the Starfury will
be among them, but I'd be very surprised if someone didn't start putting
them out eventually (though nothing's set yet).  Hell, I want one for
myself.

     Best to the U of MN viewers.

                                                                        jms
