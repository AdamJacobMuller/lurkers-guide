<H2>JMS:  Legal system on B5/in Ea</H2>
4 May 1994<PRE>     Yes, absolutely; in "The Quality of Mercy," you'll get a look at
how the justice system has come to grips with the question of how to
handle violent crimes in an environment like a space station, which has
limited room for cells, limited resources, and other complications.  We
do plan to get into this area a bit, without getting too LA LAW about it.

                                                                     jms
