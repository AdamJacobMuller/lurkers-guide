15 May 1994<PRE>     Due to a GEnie mailbox glitch, I missed the original posting, so I'll
answer Malcolm's question here:

     Why use G' instead of J'?

     Ask the Narns.  They's crazy, those aliens.  Just don't do nothin'
like we'd like 'em to.

     It seemed like a good idea at the time.

     Pick one.  Either are more or less accurate.

                                                                      jms
