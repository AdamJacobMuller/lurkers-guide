<H2>JMS: Coincidence?</H2>
20 May 1994<PRE>     At the point in which we join the tale of the last of the Babylon
stations, *everything* is in a state of flux...one government is on the
rise, another is declining, Earth is taking some new and disturbing
directions...so yes, they all feel there is a change coming.  It's a little
thing, but we keep it alive to keep a sense of something moving on a web,
and each movement makes the whole thing shake just a little.

                                                                        jms
