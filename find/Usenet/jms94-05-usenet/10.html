<H2>Re: Will Mira talk to GEEKS?</H2>
4 May 1994<PRE>     "And jms seems to be doing just fine...right, Joe?"

     Yeah...absolutely...fine...look, hand me those crayons, okay...though
I don't know why...the black one's all flat and you can't make good lines
with it and they won't let me sharpen it because the last time I used the
sharpener I put Nurse Filbee's finger in it but that wasn't my fault, she
pointed it at me, so if I just have the crayons, the ones with the good
points, I can get this done, get this done, on deadline, the deadlines
are important, do you like the peach color or the green for the rabbit...?

     What was the question again?

                                                                         jms
