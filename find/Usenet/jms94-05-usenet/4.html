<H2>att:jms - explosions go boom</H2>
1 May 1994<PRE>     In general, you don't see a lot of light reflecting off other
objects when there's an explosion because in general those objects aren't
close enough to cause a reflection.  Now, in "Signs," which comes up in
a couple weeks, there's explosions near a large object, and there we do
get some reflected light.

                                                                     jms
