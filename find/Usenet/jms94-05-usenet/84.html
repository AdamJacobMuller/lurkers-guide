<H2>JMS: TKO and Judaism</H2>
31 May 1994<PRE>     To the problems some have with Theodore Bikell's accent not sounding
real...it's my understanding that he was raised in Russia.
 
     Ivanova does not have an accent because she was educated overseas,
her father wanting her to have certain advantages the rest of her family
did not.
 
     Nowhere did we say that Andrei or the rest of the Ivanov family ever
emigrated.  They didn't.  They live in Russia.  Or lived, in any event.
Not everyone migrates to the US or to Israel, and not everyone wants to.
 
     On the treel/kosher discussion...I can only shrug.  Nobody's ever
shown that jews go forward into the future, placed them at the heart of
a science fiction show as a regular character, nobody's shown shiva before
in (and possibly out of) an SF series...and some folks are complaining that
not every aspect of a treel's kosher-ness was discussed at dinnertime.
 
     Some days, you just can't win....
 
     Feh.
