<H2>Re: Sinclair's D*CK!</H2>
18 May 1994<PRE>     I don't understand...what does Sinclair's duck have to do with
anything?  We weren't even planning on introducing the duck until late in
season two.  I suspect a leak.  Nothing worse than a leaky duck.

                                                                    jms
