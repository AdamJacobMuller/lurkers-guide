<H2>"Signs and Portents" -- SPOILE</H2>
16 May 1994<PRE>     Re: the theme music at the end of "Signs," I think it was me (but I
could be mistaken) who suggested to Chris, our composer, that he use the
theme, but in *minor chords* rather than major chords.  Makes it very sad,
and very effective.

                                                                     jms
