<H2>JMS: TKO and Judaism</H2>
26 May 1994<PRE>     Thanks.  I guess what helps, in terms of all this religious stuff in
a series run by an atheist, is that I've read most stuff from nearly all
of the major and second-rank religions, and generally respect them all, for
what they are: an attempt to understand the universe, and our role in it.
 So I can treat them pretty much even-handedly.  Have even read the Bible,
cover to cover, *twice*.  (Job was a lot of fun, great reading; anyone who
can make it through Numbers and Deuteronomy has my undying respect.)

                                                                       jms
