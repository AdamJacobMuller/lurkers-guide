<H2>JMS: Awestruck again!</H2>
17 May 1994<PRE>     I sympathize with your attempt; I'm not sure that *I* could get it
down to 14 pages, you're probably doing it better than I could.  As you
say, there's a lot of information there.  Most people probably aren't aware
of just how much they know until they do what you just did.  It's good to
know that this stuff gets noticed from time to time.
