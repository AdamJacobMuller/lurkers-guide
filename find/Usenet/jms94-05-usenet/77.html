<H2>Re: TKO</H2>
29 May 1994<PRE>     At one point, there was a discussion in the scene about the whole
gills/scales/fins issue, to define kosher...but it *really* brought the
scene to a screaming standstill, and we needed to concentrate on the
relationships at that moment.  In addition, as we looked at it, you would
have to get into the question of how alien gills/scales/fins compare to
earthly gills/scales/fins, because they're going to be very different in
many ways.  In short order it became a massive Talmudic discussion, and
we only have an hour for the show....
