8 Jul 1998<PRE>It would be a question of what the group of rogue telepaths had *done* prior to
his running into them.  If, for instance, they had killed any of his fellow Psi
Cops, I think (to turn a phrase on its head) the gloves would come off.

Byron's people weren't a threat to Psi Cops until the very end.
