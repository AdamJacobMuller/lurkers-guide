<H2>Re: ATTN: JMS  The Kosh figure is hideous!!!!</H2>
11 Jul 1998<PRE>I guess opinions vary...I think it looks kind cool.

Question: did you get the one that actually says Kosh, or the Vorlon Visitor
figure?  If the latter, the color scheme is off because it ain't Kosh.  The one
that says Kosh is pretty close, in my view.

Got mine the other day, and rather like it.
