<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Interesting B5 Experience</H2>
30 Jul 1998<PRE>&gt;I did some editing and found that I
&gt;could fit a season on two T-160 cassettes (in the EP mode) if I only had one
&gt;open/close credit per tape and cut all commercials.
&gt;
&gt;What I discovered is this, Babylon 5 really is incredible when viewed this
&gt;way, it's like a 7h 35m movie!   

Exactly.  That was the challenge, to make it work on an episodic basis, but
then run together.  

This particularly works in S5 starting from about "Meditations" right through
"Sleeping in Light."  Just play it straight through, and it's one long episode.
