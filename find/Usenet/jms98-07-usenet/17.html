16 Jul 1998<PRE>&gt;Do you watch your own shows after they are done?  If yes, (and I assume it is
&gt;yes), have you ever been able to watch the show with fresh eyes?

I watch the episodes bunches of times; pieces during shooting in dailies, the
directors cut (twice, once to just watch, again to make my notes), again when
John and I do our producer's cut/edit, again when we do the audio spotting
(sound EFX and music), again when we mix the episode, again on VHS to check how
it sounds on a regular TV stereo, and again when it airs to check the
transmission.  That's 7 times just to start.

It takes me about a year or two to be able to really *see* the show,  to stop
anticipating each line before I hear it.
