&gt;Was it just me or did that dream scene with Ivanova and Vir looking at
&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;tower and the buildings around it look like something out of one of Wayne
&gt;&gt;Barlowe's paintings?  

If you check the credits, you'll see that we engaged Wayne's services to help
us design both the creature, the artifact, and the dark city.
