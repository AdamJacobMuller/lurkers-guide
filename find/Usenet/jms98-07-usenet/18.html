16 Jul 1998<PRE>Thanks...apparently, some dealers are selling the book(s) for a couple hundred
bucks apiece, which I'm kind of chagrined about, wishing they were better
books.

Which is why the next one I write has got to be a good one, because a lot of
folks will probably pick it up as an act of faith and a compliment to B5, and I
don't want to disappoint them.
