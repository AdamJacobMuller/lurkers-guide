<H2>Re: Cable Ace Awards?</H2>
29 Jul 1998<PRE>&gt;I was wondering when the cable ace awards are during the year.  It
&gt;seems like a place ripe for B5 to pick up a few awards.

Absolutely.

Unfortunately, they just canceled the awards to fold cable into the regular
Emmys.

This is typical of our luck.
