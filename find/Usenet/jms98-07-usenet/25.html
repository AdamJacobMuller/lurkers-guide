<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: B5 Making of?</H2>
29 Jul 1998<PRE>&gt;When B5 will show its final episode, it would be great to see a really big
&gt;"B5-Making of" with behind the scenes-scenes, bluper (blooper?) reels and so
&gt;on. I think that would be great for the fans.

I'll mention it.

&gt;A week ago, "DF1", the german digital Pay-TV showed the whole 4th season at
&gt;once (!!!) Yes, really! No kidding! no breaks, one episode after the other
&gt;(I guess 18 or 22 hours.) 

Holy smokes...I wonder what the reaction was for folks seeing it that way.
