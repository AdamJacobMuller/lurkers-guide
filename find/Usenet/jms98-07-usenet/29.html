31 Jul 1998<PRE>&gt;So - when will the series start? Have you any episodes written / or even
&gt;started filming? Cole is to be the captain of what? A white star? A
&gt;Terran Starship?  I'm anxious to start on this new adventure!

Begins airing January 6th; 6 episodes are now written; we start filming Monday;
and Cole's character is captain of the Excalibur, a prototype destroyer
combining human, Minbari and Vorlon tech.
