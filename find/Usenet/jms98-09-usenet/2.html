<H2>new psi corps novel out</H2>
3 Sep 1998<PRE>Just for those who haven't heard yet, the newest B5 novel -- first in a trilogy
of books about the origins of the Psi Corps through and beyond the events of
the fifth season -- is out.  "Dark Genesis," by J. Gregory Keyes, from a jms
outline.  For my money, this is probably one of the best B5 novels ever done,
and it takes quite a risk, because even though you see ancestors of some of our
characters (the books cover about 80 years), there are none of the regulars in
it.  It's our first attempt to really flesh out the B5 universe and future
history.  

Anyway, it's a hell of a read, and I commend it to you without reservation.
