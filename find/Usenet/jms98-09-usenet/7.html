Understand that video clips fall under the aegis of the various Guilds: screen
actors guild, directors guild, writers guild, others.  Even *we* can't take,
digitize, and put up digital clips of shows at ANY length on thestation.com. 
This has nothing to do with anything other than the fact that this is not
allowable by anyone, for any reason, other than WB itself.  To allow even a 10
second clip on a TV talk show, there have to be waivers (usually automatically
given) by the guilds; it's a contractual issue that supercedes anything and
everything else.

Attempts to broaden this out to anything else are invalid because everyone else
is being left alone, because nobody else is doing this.  The policy stands.
