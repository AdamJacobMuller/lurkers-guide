I think my outlines for each of the Psi Corps novels was about ten pages each. 
It spelled out the broad strokes of what happened in each one of them, and left
Gregory to fill in the gaps and work out the details in conjunction with myself
and our reference editor, so that all the timelines jived and everything made
canonical sense.
