The TNT memo was apparently real, from within the network to others in the
network.  But the egregious points have gone away.  

Not only that, but they've allocated a huge chunk of change for us to upgrade
sets and add a bunch of new sets to the series, stuff we'd been planning to do
later, but can do now instead.
