Yeah, actually I mentioned this in passing a couple of days ago on
Compuserve...wasn't that big a deal, but to recap for here:

In addition to the Christmas break, we have always taken a one-week hiatus in
the middle of shooting to avoid burning out cast and crew.  This was true of B5
throughout its history.  One week in the fall, one in the spring.

TNT has allocated additional money to build some major (large) new sets that we
had thought we'd have to wait until season 2 to implement, and to improve some
of the sets.  (We were always fighting to spiff up sets throughout B5, and we
always had to bring in our new sets gradually, like Earharts and the War Room
and others.) 

Since they're going to give us the money for that now, we figued we'd extend
the hiatus by a few weeks (a paid break for most of the actual shooting crew),
though we still have the art department, costume, construction, props and
several other departments still working away to build the sets and stuff.

We start shooting again October 19th.
