<H2>Re: ATTN: JMS - B5 LaserDisc Commentary</H2>
3 Sep 1998<PRE>Apparently Image has now confirmed with WB that the widescreen versions do
indeed exist, so that's good...on the other hand, they were produced in PAL
format for overseas, and it costs a few pennies here and there to convert them
to NTSC standard for American use, and WB is wondering if it's worth the time
and effort to do so.

So a bunch of emails to Image encouraging them to continue to press on this
issue might have some weight....

And yes, we've discussed adding further material, such as commentaries,
bloopers, lost scenes, whatever.
