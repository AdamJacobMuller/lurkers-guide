<H2>Re: ATTN: JMS - Comparisons</H2>
6 Sep 1998<PRE>&gt;Last night, I was browsing the latest issue of TV Guide (the Canadian
&gt;Edition) and was intrigued by the description of Mercy Point's premise
&gt;as:  "Think of it as ER meets Babylon 5."
&gt;
&gt;I'm just curious what your reaction is to new shows being compared to
&gt;B5.  

I'm fine with it, though each show should be allowed to find its own identity,
it shouldn't have to feel (nor should its viewers have to feel) it must be
compared with B5.  

That we've been able to create a new paradigm in SF TV is a niceness, and the
notice is welcome and long-overdue.
