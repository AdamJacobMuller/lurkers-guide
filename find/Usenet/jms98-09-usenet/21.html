&gt;But what I want to
&gt;suggest is that not only do we set up viewing parties at homes, but maybe
&gt;at Sports Bars as well, as long as it is cleared with the places to avoid
&gt;scheduling conflicts with a sporting event.

Given the content, and the likely reaction of fans to that content, a sports
bar is probably the *least* correct venue....
