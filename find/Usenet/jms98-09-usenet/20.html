23 Sep 1998<PRE>
&gt;I looked at my calendar, and the schedule for the final episodes puts
&gt;"Sleeping in Light" on the day before Thanksgiving.  That's a lousy
&gt;place to put a season/series finale--lots of people are
&gt;traveling/visiting family on that date.
&gt;

On the other hand, not everybody has family to travel to, or the means to
travel.  So perhaps a family gathering of another type, particularly among
folks new to each other in local fan areas, might be even more appropros.
