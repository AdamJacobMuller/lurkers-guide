22 Sep 1998<PRE>
&gt; i'm
&gt;looking forward to "crusade" because of the galen-character.  i saw a
&gt;clip of galen at westercon, and i was really impressed.  is peter
&gt;woodward doing as well in the role as you had hoped?

Peter is superb as Galen, utterly brilliant.  I think we lucked into a
character and an actor that is going to be extremely popular with fans.  I
couldn't be happier with his work to date; I'd put his work up there with Peter
Jurasik and Andreas Katsulas, easily.

&gt;also, i live in the san diego area.  when did you move here, how long
&gt;did you live here, and did you like it?

I lived in San Diego a few times, the last being from about 1974 to 1981.  I
actually rather enjoyed living there (I went to and graduated from San Diego
State during that time).  I cut my teeth as a journalist there, and got my
first stage credits.  I felt that the town was a little too provincial, and
still is a bit, but would've stayed if what I wanted to do could be done there,
but living in LA is necessary to work in TV.  Figures that they'd upgrade the
place just after I left....
