&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Has VORcon established contracts with the stars they have scheduled to
appear
&gt;&gt;next month? If not, how can you guarantee the convention will go on as
&gt;&gt;planned?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I was at Starcon at the end of August where Jason Carter was a guest.  He
was
&gt;heavily promoting VorCon with his convention manager, Luther Trotter, and
&gt;according to him, it is all confirmed.
&gt;
&gt;Cari

Luther is the co-organiser of VORcon, apparently.
