<H2>ATTN JMS:  Final episode title</H2>
19 Oct 1994<PRE>     My titles are often in a state of flux; "Signs and Portents" was
originally titled "Raiding Party" in my notes, as the B5 FAQ notes
somewhere.  So it may change, but for the time being, in my notes for the
series, the last episode of year five has this note: Title? -- "Farewell"
or "Sleeping in Light."
