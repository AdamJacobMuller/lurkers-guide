<H2>USA TODAY and the Truth about</H2>
31 Oct 1994<PRE>     In my hand, I hold a bunch of articles that came out today about the
O'Hare/Bruce situation.  TV Guide, the Washington Post, the Orange
County Register and several others, all citing different sources, ALL
CONFIRM what has been said here before by me and others.  The USA Today
piece is simply an editorial assumption by the reporter that is not
buttressed by any other information.  The other articles got it right;
the one you cite did not.

     But hey...a half dozen get it right, one just misses...I'm not about
to complain.

     Give it a rest and get a life, Ford.

     If you say people should "accept the truth" because it appears in
print, then I assume that YOU will now "accept the truth" and shut up and
quit being a nuisance.
