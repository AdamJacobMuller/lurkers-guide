<H2>Spoliers and Portents: A Seaso</H2>
30 Oct 1994<PRE>     A good and thoughtful analysis.  You also caught one of the aspects
of "Chrysalis" that I was going for.  The teaser of that episode is very
much just the sort of thing we've seen before; designed to lull you into
a sense of, "Yeah, yeah, we've seen this."  Right down to the tired look
on Sinclair's face.  Been there, done that.  Then you yank the viewer's
blanket.  And structurally, it was designed to somewhat mirror the events
in the first episode; the balance is shifting, things are going in the
reverse of what we saw before.
