<H2>Re: Ignore Ford Thaxton  (was</H2>
21 Oct 1994<PRE>     Bruce Boxleitner was not hired because of TVQ.  Bruce was hired
because he was the best actor for the part, *AND* because he had worked
with Doug Netter and John Copeland before on other projects, and thus they
knew him and had a very high regard for him.  You conveniently ignore that
aspect of it.  Also, you ignore some of the other actors that we announced
were also on the list, beneath Bruce, which included Roger Reece, who we
were strongly considering as a backup to Bruce should Bruce not turn out
to be available.  Roger is a dynamite actor, but has zero TVQ.  (To provide
the "direct evidence" that Theron Fuller keeps nudging about, a call to his
agent can confirm the discussions.)  There were several other actors whose
names you've probably never HEARD of on that list...so if the only thing
we wanted was a TVQ actor, if that was the reason for replacing O'Hare,
then why would we be wasting time talking to actors without a TVQ?

     "My only interest is that I can't stand BS."  Meaning you came into
this with the ASSUMPTION, based on nothing, that this was BS.  As far as
I'm concerned, it's your comments that are strictly bullshit.  Your whole
attitude is one of just wanting to make people upset (your note about
some truth to your getting a kick out of irritating people), and disdain
at the people here as "worshippers."  It seems to me that anytime in the
past, as with here, when somebody mouths off out of ignorance or bile or
cupidity, and gets called on it, he tends to try and kill the messenger
by describing the folks doing the disagreeing as "worshippers."  This is
an old gag, and we've seen it here before.  Seen it, been there, boring.

     Re: O'Hare not saying much about the situation in Starlog...item
number one is that you're relying on what was quoted, and that may not
(almost certainly was not) all that was said.  Item number two, and more
important: Michael is a very private man.  He didn't say anything about it
because it's none of anyone's business, and he wants to keep the whole
show on a positive basis because he believes in it.  You operate off the
boneheaded theory that someone who says nothing on the subject surely must
have something to hide.  Now me, I was born in America, where a person is
innocent until proven guilty.  You seem to operate from the assumption
that everyone is guilty of whatever it is you think they're guilty of,
until such time as they prove otherwise.  You must come from a very odd,
and very dark place.

     You can "stand your ground" all you want; you have nothing but your
erroneous facts, misapprehensions, delusions and convenient misquotings
to rely on.  Obviously you're laboring under some sort of problem in
maturity or some other area, but either way it's got nothing to do with
my show, or the people here.

     And you have not answered my query: please provide for me the names
of your last 3-4 employers, so that I may contact them, or speculate
freely, about your reasons for departing said employment.  After all, you
haven't said anything about them in response to a direct query...thus by
your own reasoning you MUST have something to hide.  And by being here in
front of several thousand "worshippers," you're as public a figure as
O'Hare.

     Why would I possibly want to know this?  Why, for the same reasons
you express.  "I can't stand BS."
