<H2>ATTN JMS:Thank You</H2>
31 Oct 1994<PRE>     I very much appreciate your thoughts.  I sometimes think that a few
people get so caught up in what they want that we're not doing to their
satisfaction, that they don't see what we *have* done.

     As for other books...DEMON NIGHT and OTHERSYDE are my first two
novels from Dutton (hardcover); TALES FROM THE NEW TWILIGHT ZONE in
paperback; and a bunch of short stories in various magazines.
