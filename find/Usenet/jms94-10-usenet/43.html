<H2>JMS: Ivonova and Janine M.</H2>
21 Oct 1994<PRE>     No, Janine never came to mind while creating Ivanova.  I still like
Janine a lot, but to me they're very different people.  Mainly I was
looking at other people I've known from that part of the world, and my own
background in that area, and acting accordingly.
