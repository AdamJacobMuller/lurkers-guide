<H2>"Chrysalis" -- MAJOR SPOILERS</H2>
8 Oct 1994<PRE>     Re: being fooled into thinking the crystal construct in Delenn's
quarters was nothing more than a meditation thing...in general, it helps
to remember that I subscribe to Anton Chekov's First Rule of Playwriting:
"If there's a gun on the wall in act one, scene one, you must fire the
gun by act three, scene two.  If you fire a gun in act three, scene two,
you must see the gun on the wall in act one, scene one."

     Waste nothing.
