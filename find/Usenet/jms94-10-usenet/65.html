30 Oct 1994<PRE>     Re: you're noticing the line, "You talk like a Minbari" from Neroon
to Sinclair in "Legacies"....yup.  Sometimes this stuff is in broa
strokes, sometimes in teeny little things like that.  Also ties in even
further with where Sinclair goes.

                                                                  jms
