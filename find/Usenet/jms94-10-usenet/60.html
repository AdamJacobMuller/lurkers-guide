<H2>Ignore Ford Thaxton, maybe...</H2>
26 Oct 1994<PRE>     Excuse me, but the points *are* disputed, particularly the statement
that ratings were down at the end of the season, when (as posted by me at
the time, and verifiable via the trades) ratings for the last seven eps
in a ROW were UP, each one higher than the one before.

     This is really approaching theater of the absurd proportions....
