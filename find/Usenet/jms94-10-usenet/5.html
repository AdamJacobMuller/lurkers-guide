<H2>Star Trek SPOILERS: Things tha</H2>
2 Oct 1994<PRE>     Two items: 1) you will never see an episode of B5 which sets up all
kinds of cool conflicts, only to learn it was all a dream.  2) In addition
to your comment about stations having to buy TNG and DS9 to get Voyager,
word keeps floating around that if stations want Voyager, they can't take
B5.  Interesting, huh?
