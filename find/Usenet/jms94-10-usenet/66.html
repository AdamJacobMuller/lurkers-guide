<H2>Point of Departure</H2>
31 Oct 1994<PRE>     Some time ago, I mentioned (here and elsewhere) that "Points" was
designed to be a less intense episode than either "Chrysalis" or the
second episode of year two, "Revelations," which is in many ways even
more intense than "Chrysalis."  I think you need to give viewers a rest
here and there; if you did "Chrysalis" every episode at this point you'd
scare the hell out of people, and we're trying not to alienate those who
might be interested in checking out the first episode this year.  (I tend
to use this approach overall as well; if we've had 2-3 serious episodes
in a row, I write a funny episode, just to keep things varied.)
