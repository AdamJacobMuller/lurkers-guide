<H2>Re: Chrysalis (Yeah, yeah - SP</H2>
8 Oct 1994<PRE>     Kosh's brevity is one of the things I like best about him; in the
year two episode "The Coming of Shadows," he has just two words in the
whole episode...but they're guaranteed to give just about anyone the
willies.

     BTW, Kosh's statement, "And so it begins."  Referring to Delenn's
situation, and to more than that.  Sound familiar?
