22 Oct 1994<PRE>     "The show's ratings were going down at the end of last season."

     Sorry, another fabrication on your part.

     We were on an up-swing.  The only time we dipped badly was when we
hit the first batch of reruns.  In point of fact, "at the end of last
season," our final seven episodes EACH INCREASED OVER THE ONE BEFORE, by
quite a substantial amount.  It was a sharp, definite upward curve.

     You'd know that if you knew what you were talking about, instead of
just making stuff up.

     It's amazing how, to try and make people think that I'm less than
forthright, they inevitably resort to lying....
