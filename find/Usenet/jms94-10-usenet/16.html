<H2>capitalism in babylon 5 lookin</H2>
3 Oct 1994<PRE>     Garibaldi hustled Naomi out of there because she was the head of
the strike, and he came specifically to arrest her.

     While to varying degrees there's less nationalism in the future of
B5, it's not like everyone's suddenly talking like the folks on Melrose
Place.  Americans are, nominally, one country...but you can get accents
of varying kinds all over the country, sometimes within miles of one
another.  This is just realism.

     The star on Ivanova's helmet is a traditional Russian star, going
back to Tsarist russia and beyond, not a Red Star.

     The writer for "By Any Means Necessary" is Kathryn Drennan, who is
very astute politically, a believer in the rights of workers (and all
folks, actually), and think that characters are more interesting if they
act smart than if they act stupid.

     And yes, Ivanova's a hoot.
