<H2>Re: Chrysalis (Ooo) SPOILER AL</H2>
5 Oct 1994<PRE>     Now that you've seen this much, now you can begin putting together
the other level of the metaphor that is B5...consider: a war that did not
end satisfactorily for us, not winning or losing, a sort of peace with
honor....the death of a president...the rise of intelligence agencies
and military power...start to sound familiar?  Now what we begin to do
is to start moving around the pieces, shifting the mirror of the story
to reveal different aspects of ourselves, as well as tell the other
separate story of B5 itself.  Again, the idea is for this story to
function on *many* different levels: future-history, myth, adventure
story, mystery and a metaphor.
