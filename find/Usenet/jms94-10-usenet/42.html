<H2>Straczynski pays homage to...</H2>
20 Oct 1994<PRE>     Actually, these "homages" are all incorrect, and only exist in
the perception of the perceiver....

     1) the Douglas Adams "homage."  Nope.  Eric Sevareid once wrote
that "working in television is like being nibbled to death by ducks."  I
think it was in his book "Not So Wild A Dream," itself a line borrowed
from a poem by Norman Corwin.  It's also a fairly common phrase.

     2) Whitley Streiber.  Aliens like that in "Communion" have been
shown and drawn a LOT longer than Streiber has been talking about them.
No relation.

     3) Forbidden Planet...the script called for a chasm.  I got three
different storyboards from Ron.  The best looking was that one, and
that's the one we went to, though I knew it would resonate.
