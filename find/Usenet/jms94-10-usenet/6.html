<H2>Ratings: DS9 vs. B5</H2>
2 Oct 1994<PRE>     I'm not sure what I feel about a head-to-head DS9-B5 deal over in
your part of the world; I don't think it's necessary, and may be less than
constructive.  But I've always said, let the marketplace decide.  Meanwhile
we'll keep telling the best stories we can, and hope for the best.
