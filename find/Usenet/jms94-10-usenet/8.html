<H2>JMS: Does it cost more to repl</H2>
2 Oct 1994<PRE>     The cost of running B5 is the same if once or twice per week; some
stations like to get a bigger rating for airing it once a night, than
splitting it over two nights.  (National sponsors like the combined
rating; local stations can only sell according to what they get in their
individual hours.)
