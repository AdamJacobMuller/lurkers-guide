<H2>reaction: Points of Departure</H2>
30 Oct 1994<PRE>     In a sense, yes, "Believers" now enters the arc...but so does "Soul
Hunter," in a big way.  Replay Lennier's talk to Sheridan and Ivanova,
then play Delenn's conversation with Sinclair and the Soul Hunter in that
episode, and suddenly a lot of elements begin to intersect.
