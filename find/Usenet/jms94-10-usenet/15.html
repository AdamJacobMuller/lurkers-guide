<H2>JMS:  Are storylines in the co</H2>
3 Oct 1994<PRE>     The B5 comic, novels and series are meant to be compartmentalized
and independent, but complementary; if you never read the comic or the
novel, you'll never have a problem with the series; but as with the show,
the more you see, the more you'll get stuff coming down the road.
