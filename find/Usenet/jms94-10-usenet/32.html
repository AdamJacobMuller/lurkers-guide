<H2>ATTN JMS - Parallels (was Re:</H2>
8 Oct 1994<PRE>     If the B5 story tracked reality too closely, it wouldn't be metaphor
anymore, and would lose all its fancifulness.  A metaphor creates a general
state or feeling in this case, so no, it won't track history precisely;
it's a blend of many things, history, the story of the original Babylon,
various myths, lots of stuff.  Throw it all into a pot, and out comes B5.
