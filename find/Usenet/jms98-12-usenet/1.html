1 Dec 1998<PRE>&gt;"...if you're going to criticize me for not finishing the whole thing
&gt;and tying it up in a bow for you, why, do us both a favor and write your
&gt;own damn book, only have the decency to call it a romance instead of a
&gt;history, because history's got no bows on it, only frayed ends of
&gt;ribbons and knots that can't be untied. It ain't a pretty package but
&gt;then it's not your birthday that I know of, so I'm under no obligation
&gt;to give you a gift."

I knew there was a reason I liked his books....
