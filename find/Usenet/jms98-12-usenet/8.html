<H2>Re: Attn: JMS RISING STARS preview &amp; #0 info?</H2>
26 Dec 1998<PRE>&gt;If you're still out there Joe, I'm hoping you can give further info
&gt;on your upcoming comic series.  There's a RISING STARS Preview issue, 16 
&gt;b&amp;w pages for $5 (probably $7.50 Canadian, *ouch*!) solicited in the new 
&gt;Previews catalog from Diamond distributors.  Also, a #0 is to
&gt;be included in the March issue of Wizard magazine.
&gt;
&gt;

I'm still here, just sorta coasting, mainly replying by email to stuff I see
that needs replying to, and wondering why on earth people are still responding
to Cronan as if a) he had anything of value to say, b) were actually a carbon
based life form, instead of a juvenile troll in need of attention....

&gt;The info given is unclear whether the preview or #0 are actually comics 
&gt;style stories or text and art samples from #1-on?  And the preview only 
&gt;lists the artist as "various" and nothing for #0.  Who is/are the 
&gt;artist(s)?

The preview is 70% story, 30% art samples and other supporting stuff for the
book; the issue 0 is a full story.  Top Cow hasn't released info on the artist
yet.

So far, everybody there is massively jazzed about the new book; the scripts
(I've turned in the preview, 0 and 1 so far) keep getting passed from person to
person as they come in, and read and reread.  Apparently they're knocked out by
it.
