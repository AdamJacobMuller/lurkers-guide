30 Dec 1996<PRE>Basically, I figured with a culture in decline, often the birth rate goes
down; it's also a fairly small world, all things considered...and a LOT of
them live on other colonies, they've been spreading out a lot longer than
we have...and of course they have always been sensible about birth control
and population growth, one of their few wisdoms, and one we could learn
from.
