20 Dec 1996<PRE>"I know you don't do Christmas. Any favorite charities you'd like to
encourage fans towards, instead?"

I'd say your local charities should come first: battered women shelters,
AIDS hospices, and the like.  If you need something national, I'd say the
Red Cross, or the Boy's and Girl's Clubs (which kept me off the streets
and out of trouble for more years than I want to think about), or if you
want a good political group, Norman Lear's People for the American Way or
Harry Chapin's World Hunger Year.
