19 Dec 1996<PRE>Actually, WB and I have already had discussions about this (along with
John C. and others in B5 production).  What we proposed, because of the
unique relationship between us and the online community, was that WB *not*
go after the fan web pages AS LONG AS they attached the proper copyright
info to any graphics or other material that's owned by WB.  This prevents
the material from falling into the public domain, which is the main
concern here.  (Most folks don't know that you can lose your copyright if
you do not make best, concerted efforts to defend it.)

It's a sane and sensible policy, and thus far it seems to be working.
