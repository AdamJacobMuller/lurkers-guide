<H2>Re: '97 Hugo - Which episode?</H2>
9 Dec 1996<PRE>As I understand it, only the episodes aired in calendar year 96 are
eligible for the Hugo in 97.  "Gethsmane" aired in November of 95, so it
would be ineligible.

Everything in season 3 starting in January/February through the first 4
episodes of year 4 is eligible.
