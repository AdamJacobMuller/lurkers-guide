27 Dec 1996<PRE>In a way, I was going more for the visual, the image...the whole show is a
matter of what door you choose to go through, and the door not taken.  If
you wanted to take the scene *absolutely* literally, then since that room
adjoined Justin's, the shadows were inside.  Or you can take it a little
more metaphorically.
