20 Dec 1996<PRE>"Do you folks hand them to them as a package?  Or does WB?  If the former,
will you just hand them everything, as in "here's the show, here's the
listing, here's the order, etc."?"

WB handles all distribution, and they'll be given the airdate schedule,
most likely, and that will become the template.
