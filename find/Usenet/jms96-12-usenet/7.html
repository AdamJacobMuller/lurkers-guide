<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: To thank you</H2>
7 Dec 1996<PRE>Thanks.  Hope is one of the things that seems greatly missing from most
commercial entertainments, and if they do try to do something in this
area, it often tends to wander into the treacly or saccherine.  We have to
entertain, that is the requirement...but there has to be more, for me, for
it to be worth doing.

Thanks for the kind words.
