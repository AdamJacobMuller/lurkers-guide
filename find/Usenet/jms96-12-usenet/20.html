<H2>Re: Attn JMS et al.: Cast and Crew comments</H2>
9 Dec 1996<PRE>We do encourage our crew to get out there, and some do, but most are
fairly quiet types.  You have some of them over on AOL, pitching in, but
still not as many as could be.

I've taken it on myself to work to get more of our crew out into the
limelight lately, to make sure they get proper attention for their work. 
I dragged George Johnsen in front of the crowd at Worldcon, and again with
producer John Copeland at LosCon a few weeks ago (those were,
respectively, their first times appearing at cons).
