20 Dec 1996<PRE>"I for one appreciate your forthrightness, and the insight into how you
handle the writing of such a huge arc-story was fascinating!"

Thanks...again, that's part of the reason for all this, so people can
better understand why things happen the way they happen when making a TV
series.  There's so much misinformation and bad mythology out there...if
this can ameliorate that a bit, all the better.
