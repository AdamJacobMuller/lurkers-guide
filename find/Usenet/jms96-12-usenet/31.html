14 Dec 1996<PRE>"Considering her past role in Minbari society, though, I expect her to
snap out of it pretty soon.  She was *trained* to take charge, and even
the things she's endured lately won't supress that conditioning forever."

Oh, most definitely...count on it.  She's done more than enough "oh john"
stuff for my tastes...that will start to change, and soon.
