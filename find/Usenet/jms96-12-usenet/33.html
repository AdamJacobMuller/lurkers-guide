16 Dec 1996<PRE>All of which is, of course, the irony in the situation...many times, fans
ask for shows with colors other than black and white, shades of grey,
changes in character...but when you start executing those changes, showing
more than one side, even contradictory sides (as humans are masses of
internal contradictions) often some of them yell "HEY! STOP THAT!"  

Which goes back to the moral: "Be careful what you ask for."
