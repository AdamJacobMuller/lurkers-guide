<H2>Re: Attn jms: Any ratings news?</H2>
9 Dec 1996<PRE>They're going very well.  The last batch of episodes were 3.8 in the
ratings, which is much better than last year, and put us fairly
consistently in the top 25.  Though the rankings dropped a bit because of
the number of people watching during sweeps, and the stunt programming,
the number of households watching the show went up about 100,000 per week.
 So WB is extremely pleased; we stay at the #5 rated dramatic series, and
that ain't bad.
