1 Dec 1996<PRE>"She was specifically referring to the PPG blasts and the "Kosh's head
exploding" effects.  After which I told her that the old company was gone,
off to do ST:V."

Actually, Foundation was not the sole source of PPG bursts; that's roto
work, and was often done by Kevin Kutchaver, and others not at Foundation.
 Oddly, we just had a meeting about PPG bursts, because we've done about 4
or 5 different versions over the last 4 years.  We decided to go back
closer to the ones in Soul Hunter in future, since they just look nastier.
