19 Dec 1996<PRE>And this really isn't about setting records, that ain't the point, only a
byproduct.  The emphasis has to be quality; quantity means nothing if it's
a lot of bad TV.

(If one chooses to really quibble, 92 TZs are mainly half-hours, so you're
looking at about 50 hours, and the number of jms B5's have already
exceeded that number.  But again, this is really a rather silly
discussion.)
