<H2>Re: Masters of the Universe</H2>
14 Dec 1996<PRE>This was the first TV series on which I was a staffer, acting as a story
editor (with Larry DiTillio) and one of the main writers for the series,
and its subsequent companion series, She-Ra.

And I'm confident that sooner or later, I'll have to answer for this
before the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal.
