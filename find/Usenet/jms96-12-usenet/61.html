<H2>Re: Joe's Relationship with B5 Viewers</H2>
27 Dec 1996<PRE>"...do any other producers maintain this level of dialogue with their
viewers?"

None that I'm aware of.  Some maintain a presence on-line on an occasional
basis, or on one or two services, or have someone filter their
messages...but none at this level that I can name.  

"But there must come a point when you turn away from the keyboard and
laugh "it's just a tv show"."

It is...?  Good heavens...then what's that Vorlon doing in the living
room...?
