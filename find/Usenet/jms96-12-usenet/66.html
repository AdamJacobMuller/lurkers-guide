<H2>Re:  ATT:JMS WAS Joe's Relationship with B5 Viewers</H2>
28 Dec 1996<PRE>"You've said that you're still afraid that you'll give a presentation and
no one will come -- do *you* sometimes go home and think, "Boy, that was a
dumb thing to say", "Geez, I didn't put that at all well" etc.?"

The question is have I ever done a presentation and *not* thought that
afterward.  I invariably will ask someone I know, if present, "Was that
okay?  I really muffed that part before the tape...and I didn't get this
guy's question, but now I see what he was trying to ask now that I'm off
the stage..."  I always have this kind of grunge feeling that I muffed it,
did I provide enough for the people who came all this way...on and on and
on.

So yeah...ALL the time.
