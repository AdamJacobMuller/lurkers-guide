<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: CD-ROM?</H2>
18 Dec 1996<PRE>"...hello from Starfire Sacramento, a sci-fi club that adores your work."

Hello back.  I assume this refers primarily to B5?

"Are there any plans for a CD-ROM game or somesuch based on Babylon 5? "

Doug and I acquired the rights to do a B5 informational CDrom, which we're
now in the process of developing for next year.  It's going to be a bit
more than a guide, very subversive and funny in its way.

There have been a number of inquiries about a game for CDrom, but so far
no one has really come up to the plate in a serious fashion.
