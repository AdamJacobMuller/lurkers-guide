<H2>Re: Ellison TREK Book! (from j</H2>
14 Aug 1995<PRE>     Robert: Harlan is not on the nets, nor does he have a modem, so he
does not have access.  He is part of the B5 team, and as such I feel no
more compunction in announcing the book than any appearance at a con by
one of our actors, or the appearance of an actor in another show or play,
which I've done from time to time.  People have gone to great length to
locate my own books, and I figured the same folks would like to know about
his book, for the same reason.  Finally, Harlan asked if I would do it as
a friend, since again he doesn't have ACCESS to the nets, and I obliged.
