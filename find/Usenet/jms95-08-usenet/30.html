<H2>ATT JMS: Twin Peaks</H2>
5 Aug 1995<PRE>     I liked Twin Peaks a lot, though the truth is they really had NO idea
where the heck they were going, and they kinda threw stuff in randomly a
lot.  (This from one of the staffers over there at the time in the writing
department.)  If you missed one ep you were screwed in trying to follow it,
but jeez, it was a great ride while it lasted.
