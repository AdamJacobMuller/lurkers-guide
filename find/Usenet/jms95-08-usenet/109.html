<H2>Help help I'm being repr-</H2>
21 Aug 1995<PRE>     Here's the ultimate irony.  I write one message that honks off, oh,
I'd say maybe 6 guys out of the 10,000 or so who hang out here, and they
pillory me endlessly...and in so doing, write dozens of messages that
honk off *hundreds* of people, probably more from my email, even go so far
as to insult those people directly...but THAT'S okay.
 
     Where's the Red Queen when you really need her...?
