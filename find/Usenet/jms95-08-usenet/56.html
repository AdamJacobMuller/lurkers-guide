<H2>ATTN JMS</H2>
13 Aug 1995<PRE>     Fleer cards are due out in September.  Sheridan sent an EA distress
signal; the Minbari were in genocidal mode, so it didn't matter to them
the condition of their enemy.
 
     RE: religion, my atheism, and religion in the show...my own
background...is my own background.  Suffice to say I came to my position
as an atheist through a long, difficult and trying road.
 
     Have I studied other religions?  Yes.  I was sufficiently interested
in the subject sui generis that I minored in philosophy during college,
to the point where I was about 9 credits short of a degree in the area.
(Well, and a thesis, but why quibble?)  I've read the Bible cover to
cover, twice; the Bahagavad-Gita, the Book of Mormon, I've got a whole
shelfload of Zen books, books on Judaism, oriental and occidental
mythology and religion, the Koran, you name it, I've probably got it.
It falls under the general heading of, "Humanity trying to understand
itself, and its role in the universe," and that seems to me a perfectly
valid impulse.  We just all take different roads to get there.
