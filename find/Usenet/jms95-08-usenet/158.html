<H2>ATTN JMS:  B5 Writing Process</H2>
31 Aug 1995<PRE>     B5 was *never*, ever, at any time, pitched on the nets, or even
discussed on the nets, while it was in development.  Not even the name
was ever said.  So I don't know where this particular myth has come
from.
 
     The first time I ever started talking about B5 (except in an offhand
reference in a Starlog article) on the nets was about November 1991, when
we'd finally been given the go-ahead for production on the pilot movie,
but couldn't officially talk about it until WB announced it.  During that
time, I only described it as "That Which Cannot Be Named" (TWCBN for
short) on GEnie.
