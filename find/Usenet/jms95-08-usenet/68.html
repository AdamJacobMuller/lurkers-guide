<H2>Abuse of this newsgroup by JMS</H2>
14 Aug 1995<PRE>     On this system, there are discussions of where to find Micro
Machines, prices on toys, where to find the soundtrack, where to find my
prior books, where to find cassettes of previous work by other actors,
and nobody raised a peep about this.  The notification about Harlan's
book falls into exactly that same category; if people have a problem with
Harlan, that's their problem, but to say the rest of this is and has been
okay, but to single this out, is hypocrisy at its most obvious.
 
     I have, on occasion, used this forum to point people to things
I thought would be of interest, related to their interests, including the
PBS airing of "The Wrong Trousers," which I promoted here all over the
place, and which helped lots of them find a show they loved.
 
     So if we're going to make an issue out of this, then we should no
longer tell anyone where they can find the sountracks, or the toys, or
the books, or the prices thereof, or actors other work, or my other
books, which have no relation to B5 other than that I wrote them.
 
     If this were strictly an advertisement for something that had nothing
to do with B5, then that's one thing, but Harlan Ellison is Babylon 5's
Conceptual Consultant, and has been for going on three years now, and I
see absolutely *NO* reason, moral or ethical, why he should be denied the
support of this forum except some people's compulsion to attack anything
involving Harlan.
