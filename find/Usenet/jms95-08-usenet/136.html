<H2>Re: The Price of the Peace</H2>
24 Aug 1995<PRE>     David...leaving totally aside the issue of the tapes for now, even
though that was your motivating factor...it's a breach of the ethics of
this system to send postings by others, myself included, to the people at
Warner Bros.  Second, we were already *handling* the issue, were already
dealing with it.  Until that moment, I referred matters of concern to
those empowered to act, at the proper, lower-level areas.  What your
letter did was to embroil the two heads of Warner Bros., who until that
moment didn't know the system much existed.
 
     And now folks from legal affairs regularly monitor the nets.  Because
you poked the head of the dragon.  You can explain to your heart's content,
but that is the consequence of your actions.  It was wrong.
 
     Again *we were dealing with it*.  But once your letter crossed
certain desks, who were unaware of the fact that we were dealing with it,
the call went out, "What the hell is THIS?"  If you needed information,
it was right here, and any question could've been answered by me.  And,
in fact, was.  By essentially ratting out the entire group to WB Legal,
however well-intentioned your motives, you've caused me problems in having
to then go back and fix the damage, explaining that we were already on
top of the issue, and caused others problems as well.
 
     I wasn't going to make a federal case out of this, but when I saw
your note indicating possibly yet ANOTHER cause celebre you were about to
start throwing around out there, and urging action, I worried, given how
this LAST one was handled.  Or mishandled.
 
     Sometimes, David, it's best to just leave things alone....
