24 Aug 1995<PRE>     You want to know what it comes down to?  What it *really* comes down
to?  Here it is.
 
     This was stated by a network exec: "Look, the reality is, anybody
with money these days has got cable, they've got VCRs, laserdisks, so the
networks get what's left, the guys without a lot of money, or education,
and that's going to have to be our target audience."
 
                                                                    jms
