21 Aug 1995<PRE>     Robert Holland: in one message from you, you take a shot at Harlan's
income (or what you perceive as his income), saying "He needs the bucks
for his medicare payments."
 
     But then, when I turn the question back to you, and your income, you
say, "of the many measures of a man, income is nominal."
 
     So which is it, Robert?  Or is it only irrelevant when it's you, and
relevant when it's somebody at whom you choose to snipe?
 
     Hypocrite.
 
                                                                 jms
