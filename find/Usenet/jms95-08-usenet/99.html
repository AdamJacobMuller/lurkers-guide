<H2>ATTN JMS MID-POINT</H2>
18 Aug 1995<PRE>      No, I was responding to a note re: midpoing in the series from a
total point of view, i.e., on a 5 year run, year 3 is the midpoint, and
in fact, in another month or so, I'll have written episode 11 of year
three, which is the *exact* halfway point on that axis.
 
      I put *zero* faith in the Syd Field school of thought.
