<H2>Apologies to JMS, WB, et al...</H2>
29 Aug 1995<PRE>     The main problem, as I understand it, is the issue of the shows that
have not aired here yet, which touches international law re: copyright;
in general, though, if someone has made a tape of something, and wishes
to show it to a group of friends, and no cost is attached, I'm not aware
of any complications to this.
