<H2>ATTN JMS: Character Developmen</H2>
21 Aug 1995<PRE>     All scripts are tightly scripted.  The actors are not involved at
that level.  When the script lands on the stage, it's performed as
written.  If an actor has a problem with a particular word or line, I'm
happy to take a suggestion or provide an alternate word.  But that's it.
This is in part because with a 5-year story, with foreshadowing, changing
one word could have major repercussions.  And because it's my show, and
it'll be done the way I wrote it.  I didn't work five years to get this
show on the air to turn it over to any committee of any kind.
