<H2>ATTN JMS: Candle motif</H2>
31 Aug 1995<PRE>     Candles are, I think, wonderfully emblematic of life, and of being
a single ray of light, or hope, in a dark place.  The Grey Council stands
between the candle and the star; watch G'Kar's action re: a candle in his
quarters...and in that scene (for those who've seen TLTS) note how many
candles are in the room in the beginning, and at the end.
 
     We are the candle that burns brightly, stubbornly, effectively...but
briefly.
