<H2>JMS' "Murder, She Wrote" on US</H2>
4 Aug 1995<PRE>     Ah, yes, that episode was the first I wrote for Murder, She Wrote
while engaged there as writer/producer.  So yes, there should be others
coming up in the current batch by me.  It really was a fun show in many
ways; I'd still be there now in all likelihood had not B5 come along when
it did.  It's hard to find a truly literate show to write for.  And the
cast was uniformly great, inclusive of Angela and Bill Windom.
