<H2>ATTN JMS:</H2>
21 Aug 1995<PRE>    Zack wasn't in the opening credits for year two because he came in
with just one or two eps going in...but the more we saw him, the more
we knew he could give us just what we were looking for in one part of the
overall story, and so it grew.  And the Fleer cards have several
different approaches...arc cards, episode cards, character cards and
so on.
