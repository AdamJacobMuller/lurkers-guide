<H2>StarQuest'95 and Warner Brothe</H2>
18 Aug 1995<PRE>     Here's what has transpired.
 
     Some time ago, I warned many people here about publicly offering to
make lots and lots of copies of B5 episodes -- the final 4 -- from the UK
to the US.  I was concerned about this on many levels.
 
     In the midst of this, one of the netters faxed WB Legal Affairs a
series of copies of these posts.  At which point WBLA went into total
and complete meltdown, due to the copyright violation aspects, which are
rightfully their concern.
 
     They have been with us since, and now monitor the nets.
 
     Public offers of substantial video copying will *invariably* bring
in such things.
 
     Ivanova's Rule #9: I will *listen* to jms.
 
                                                                   jms
