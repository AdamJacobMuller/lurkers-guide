18 Aug 1995<PRE>     Dennis: you consider Harlan a "bigot" because he thinks some netters
are stupid, ignorant, flame-baiting, offensive, venal, vindictive,
spiteful little web-weasels.
 
     Yeah, Dennis, you know, you're right...looking at some of the notes
that've come my way, I can't *imagine* where he EVER got a notion like
that...it can ONLY be bigotry, can't POSSIBLY be true.
 
     Thank you for clearing this up.
