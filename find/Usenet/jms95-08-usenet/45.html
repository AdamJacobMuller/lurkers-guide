<H2>Ellison TREK Book! (from jms)</H2>
9 Aug 1995<PRE>       It's the story that followers of STAR TREK have been discussing,
analyzing, disseminating and hearing for nearly thirty years, involving what
polls and conventions have consistently shown to be the single best episode
of the original STAR TREK series ever produced: "The City on the Edge of
Forever."
 
       What *really* happened?  Who *really* did the final produced script?
How did the original script come to be, what was in it (and almost as
important, given rumors, what *wasn't* in it), and what do those most
directly involved have to say about it?
       For the first time, you'll hear directly not only from Harlan
Ellison (the article in the TV Guide special ST issue was basically just a
warm-up), but also from Leonard Nimoy, Peter David, DeForest Kelley, Walter
Koenig, D.C. Fontana, Melinda Snodgrass and George Takai...not in
interviews, but in essays they have themselves written on the subject, for
publication for the first time.
 
       Publication where, you ask?  In THE CITY ON THE EDGE OF FOREVER, the
definitive book on the subject just completed by Harlan and those indicated
above.  The limited edition book contains not only the first version of the
script, but subsequent revisions, two of the original treatments, actual
correspondence printed here for the first time which will dispell many of
the rumors circulating for over 30 years, afterwords by those noted in the
paragraph above, and a 20,000 word introduction by Harlan Ellison.
 
       Publication of this book is one of the most eagerly awaited events by
followers of STAR TREK.  Advance orders have been pouring in, and only 330
copies of the special limited edition remain, at $75 plus $5 shipping and
handling (UPS insured) from Borderlands Press, a noted and prestigious
publisher of quality limited edition books.  These will be shipping on
October 1st.  The book has already been completed, and is now at the
printers being typeset and bound.
 
       A regular trade hardcover edition will be available later, starting
December 1st, at a price of $25, plus $5 S&amp;H.
 
       This, as they say, is the Real Deal, with information withheld from
publication for 30 years, made available here for the first time, along with
the ability to show the progression through various stages of the script
that became "The City on the Edge of Forever."  For writers interested in
studying scripts, for followers of the show who want exclusive behind the
scenes info, for anyone with an abiding interest in things Trek...this is
going to be *the* book to buy, the only Star Trek-based book ever likely to
come from Harlan Ellison, and thus a sure collector's item.
 
       Visa/Mastercard orders can be placed at 1-800-528-3310, or send check
or money order to BORDERLANDS PRESS, PO Box 146, Brooklandville, MD  21022.
