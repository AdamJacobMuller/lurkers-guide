<H2>Comments on the Big Bang Con!!</H2>
18 Aug 1995<PRE>     The fans are in *no* way responsible for the problems at the con,
that's a whole other situation.
 
     I love your comment that Tom "let JMS out of JMSs contract with the
con," since I'd never SIGNED a contract of any kind.  This is yet another
untruth from Tom C.
