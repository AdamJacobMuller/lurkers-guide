<H2>ATTN JMS: Twilight(spoilers)</H2>
3 Aug 1995<PRE>     "how can it get any better?"
 
     Has to, though.  We took a blood oath on this show that each season
must be better than the one preceding.  In many ways, we're still the new
kids on the block, and we can't afford to ever once let our guard down and
settle for anything less than constant striving.  And, frankly, though it's
endless struggle, it's kinda fun on another level; we discover and invent
new ways to do things, and new approaches to story and production, on a
regular basis (tomorrow we're seeing some new CGI tricks from Ron via some
beta-test software that should let us do some truly nifty stuff...).
