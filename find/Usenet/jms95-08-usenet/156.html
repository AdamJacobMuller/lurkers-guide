<H2>JMS: Still "Getting Dark?"</H2>
31 Aug 1995<PRE>     "It's Getting Dark" was originally planned to be my third published
novel after "OtherSyde," but in the interim, after I began writing it (and
IGD was planned to be a modest sized novel, 500 pages max), I stumbled
upon a much better and, unfortunately, bigger story I wanted to write, a
contemporary dark fantasy whose title is too cool to sacrifice by giving it
out here.  The new book will probably be about 1,000 pages, give or take,
and I've got all the research and reference stuff here, ready to go, as oon
(soon) as I have the time to write it, when B5 is done.
