21 Aug 1995<PRE>     My software, and the GEnie software, does not quote; if I want to
quote someone, I have to *retype* the whole bloody quote.
 
     I sometimes think I'd like to apply that to folks who quote a 432
line message, just to add "I agree!" at the end.
 
                                                                jms
