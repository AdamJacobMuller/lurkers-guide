<H2>Twilight struggle subtext- spo</H2>
4 Aug 1995<PRE>     Without spoiling anything...yes, in this regard, I've always noted
that there are some echoes of WW II in the overall storyline, and some
applies here.  Also, again, the purpose of a large measure of the show is
to elicit discussion of such issues as this...where are the mora,
(moral) responsibilities in such a situation?  What are the ethics of
mass warfare?  Where does expediency begin and compassion end?  *Should*
compassion have to end for the greater good?
 
     If we can start some bar fights, I'll have done my job.
 
     Fact is, I don't have one single damned good answer.  But I've got a
whole LOTTA questions....
