<H2>Re: The Wrong Trousers (was Re</H2>
18 Aug 1995<PRE>     BTW, from the same guy who did "A Grand Day Out" and "The Wrong
Trousers"....he's doing a new project, a black and white film noire
clay-animation short, whose name I don't recall, but all of the parts are
played by Kirk Douglas (or figures representing Kirk) at various points
of his career...I've seen a few clips, and they're *hysterical*.
 
     BTW#2...I heard today that "The Wrong Trousers" is now on sale on
cassette at many video stores.  If you haven't seen this, go out and either
rent the tape or buy it, it's a sheer, unadulterated, no-holds-barred
delight, one of the few things that has sent me crashing to the floor with
unbridled, hysterical, eyes-watering laughter.  It's *that* good.
 
     BTW#3...if that's another advertisement...who cares, it's nifty.
