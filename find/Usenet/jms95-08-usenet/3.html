<H2>"Downbelow" a ref to Cherryh's</H2>
2 Aug 1995<PRE>     Actually, no, there was no intended not; I wanted the sense that this
place was down, as in downtown, downtrodden...briefly considered Down Under
but figured our viewers in Oz might be (rightly) bugged by it.  So Down
Under became Down Below, and I put them together into one word for slang,
DownBelow.
