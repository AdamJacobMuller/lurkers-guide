<H2>Mr. JMS: Network vs. Syndicati</H2>
21 Aug 1995<PRE>     Correct: while the money and PR budget for syndication is about half
what network shows get, the trade-off is that you're left alone, and you
get full season orders, rather than 6 eps, or 12 eps with a possible
buy in the back nine.  It lets you relax and just do the show rather than
constantly looking over your shoulder.
 
     We have not had a script note since the 3rd ep of year two; haven't
had a note on a producer's cut of a ep since year one.  They trust us more
and leave us alone more, in large measure due to being in syndication,
and I'll trade *any* amount of money for that freedom.  We could *never*
have done "Believers" or "Confessions" on network TV, given their sense
that SF = KidVid.
