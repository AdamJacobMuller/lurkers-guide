<H2>ATTN JMS:  Control groups?</H2>
31 Aug 1995<PRE>     The funny thing is, on the control groups where I lurk, there is
generally LESS speculation and "let's guess the story" and story ideas
than where I *am* around.  Generally, what you tend to get are simply
people's reactions to stuff...I liked this one, or didn't like that one,
how come they did something stupid, where can I get info...that sort of
thing.
 
     My experience has been that the *most* critical nets are the ones
where I'm known to hang out, because folks know their concerns have a
chance of reaching me.  That's probably the biggest difference.
