<H2>ATTN JMS: slander vs. you on "</H2>
13 Aug 1995<PRE>     I have never, at any time, owed anybody for a spec script because I
don't BUY spec scripts, ever; the shows on which I have worked have on
rare occasions bought spec scripts, but then they've been bought; the only
time you owe on a spec is if you used it or produced it, and I've never
done that.  So this person is frankly nuts.
