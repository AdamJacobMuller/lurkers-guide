<H2>What's it like? (Was Attn JMS:</H2>
18 Aug 1995<PRE>     What's it like for me?  Race to the studio in the morning, run from
one meeting to another, with directors, art department, costume department,
prosthetics, grab an hour with the door closed to write my brains out,
maybe get onto the stage for 5 minutes to watch a particular delicate
scene being shot, race back to more meetings, race off to editing, grab
another couple hours writing, race home, grab a sandwich, write a few
hours, and do BBSing.
 
     Sometimes, in all that, it's very possible to actually forget what it
is you're doing, to forget to *enjoy* it, because you're too much in it
("the world is too much with us").  That happens, alas, all too often.
 
     But every once in a while, one realizes just what one *is* doing,
from some comments on the BBS (holy smoke, the episode WORKED!), to
days like today, when there's one scene in particular in dailies with
G'Kar and Londo, that is *so* perfect, *so* brilliant a performance
that you realize suddenly what you're doing, and what you've touched,
and then, for a moment, it's fun.
 
      Then there's another meeting....
 
      Well, I figure I'll probably most enjoy all this long after it's
finished.
 
                                                                  jms
