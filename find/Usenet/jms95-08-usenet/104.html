<H2>Murder She Wrote on USA Thursd</H2>
21 Aug 1995<PRE>     As it happens, Tomorrow (Tuesday) one of my other M,SW episodes is
on, entitled "Incident in Lot 7," which has a little fun at the expense
of Hitchcock.  Prentiss wasn't exactly what I'd envisoned for the role,
but overall it came out okay.
