<H2>Quotes from Jeri Taylor on sto</H2>
3 Aug 1995<PRE>     There's nothing even remotely askew in anything Jeri said.  There are
two philosophies at work here (arc vs. non-arc), and neither is
intrinsically or inherently better than the other.  It's a matter of
personal tastes, and what you're trying to accomplish.
 
     The Martian Chronicles was written as a series of short stories within
a universe, somewhat loosely, but which together make enjoyable reading in
one volulme.  That's ST or most conventional series.
 
     The Dune books are tightly plotted stories over a long, pre-planned
arc.  This is the structure B5 employs.
