<H2>BAD NEWS ON B5 EFFECTS EMMY!</H2>
22 Aug 1995<PRE>     Yeah, unfortunately this is a year where we're against the Earth 2
and Voyager 2-hour pilots, upon which they spent *hideous* amounts of
money, with considerable publicity.  But hey, we'll take the 3 emmy noms
we've already gotten and be happy.
