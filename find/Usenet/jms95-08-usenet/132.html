<H2>The Price of the Peace</H2>
23 Aug 1995<PRE>     David Shao: pressure on the group regarding any character's sexuality
will result in zip from me.  I don't give in on that on either side of
the question.  We've touched on elements of this in "Divided Loyalties,"
and will again in future.  Not because of any pressure, but because it is
what I choose to do with my show.
 
     I appreciate your interest, but B5 is what it is because I have
always tried to follow my heart, and not surrender control of that to any
network, studio, focus group or any OTHER group.  It is what it is, take
it or leave it.
 
     I would also suggest that, since you were the one who faxed messages
from this system to Warner Bros. Legal Affairs, concerning the UK final
four tapes, resulting in their now continued presence here, I would suggest
that you have already had a substantial impact on things here...why not
leave well enough alone for now in other areas?
