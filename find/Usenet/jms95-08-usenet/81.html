<H2>Attn: JMS Paladin of the lost</H2>
18 Aug 1995<PRE>     Actually, "Paladin of the Lost Hour" was done by the TZ2 crew before
my incarnation a year later, so I'm not responsible for that one by
Harlan (though I will accept credit for helping bring "Crazy As a Soup
Sandwich" by HE to the screen).
 
     And yes, it's a hell of a good story.  Did I mention here that HE
just did a reading of this very story, "Paladin" for the Harlan Ellison
Record Collection, the very first such reading put out on CD?  That you
can obtain copies of this splendiferous CD by contacting HERC at PO Box
55548, Sherman Oaks, CA 91423?
 
     And why am I mentioning it here now?   Oh....just to honk off Dennis
a little more.  And because by my on-line clock, I've now been on for
3 hours, 39 minutes, 39 seconds (I literally have to answer everything
on-line in this news reader or it can't get through), going through 975
messages, and after a while, y'know...what the heck....
 
                                                                   jms
