<H2>Help: Big Bang Refunds?</H2>
13 Aug 1995<PRE>     I've been informed of late that, in addition to Michael O'Hare and
Mark Hammil getting stiffed for, respectively, appearance fees and fees
plus travel expenses, to the total of $26,000, that the photographer who
was contracted to shoot the con wasn't paid, neither was security, neither
were the travel agents for the airline arrangements.  I'm told that Tom
has gone to ground, and am trying to confirm if he's just blipped off
the map.
 
     Nearly all these other people, btw, are fans...which is what I was
worried about, that fans would be the ones hurt by this, which is what
I said from day one, but the Big Bang apologists came out and said I was
over-reacting, exaggerating, that *I* was the problem...and now they see
what's happened, and suddenly they've gone silent and also can't be
found.
 
     Cassandra, indeed....
