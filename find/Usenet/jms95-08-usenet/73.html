<H2>Re: Help: Big Bang Refunds?</H2>
14 Aug 1995<PRE>     "Cassandra" has nothing to do with respect; it comes from the idea
of someone warning about possible harm, and nobody believing until it's
too late.
 
    E?Ka  y`rAnd by the way, Colin, it wasn't just "one man's opinion," it was
the opinion of me and every other cast member who was there for the
Planet Hollywood thing.  And it was the opinion of people who *were
there*, and however a "feeding frenzy" might bother you, it was also the
absolute truth, as has been borne out by facts.  And sometimes those who
jump in when they think a "feeding frenzy" is going on, without knowing
all the facts, end up doing more harm than good, however well-intentioned
their actions.
