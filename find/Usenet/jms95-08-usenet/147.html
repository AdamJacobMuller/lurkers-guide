<H2>B5 and Jung (was Re: Shadows/V</H2>
29 Aug 1995<PRE>     Well reasoned.  An analysis of some of the stuff in Jungian terms,
as I've noted here before, is not entirely unproductive.
 
     It really is a hodgepodge of bits and pieces, a Frankenstein monster
assembled from elements of myth, and archetype, and history that I've been
kind of subconsciously assembling over a long, long time.
 
     Certainly the issue touches strongly on the whole question of who we
are, how we define ourselves, our place in the universe (as we perceive
it, and as we are *able* to perceive it, stuck as we are in th
metaphorical fishbowl).
 
     One of the problems, I feel, when film makers or novelists use Joseph
Campbell's approach to storytelling is that they're going by the numbers
in terms of the *action* involved (okay, the hero has a trial to endure,
enters the cave, and so on), without looking to, or paying attention to,
the philosophical/mythological underpinnings of the actions, what they
MEAN in a larger context, what they are meant to tell us about ourselves
and the world.
 
     So it's an ongoing process to redefine the myths, and in so doing
redefine the way we perceive ourselves.  Or something like that.
 
                                                                   jms
