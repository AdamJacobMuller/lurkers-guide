<H2>ATTN JMS: Reading speed?</H2>
23 Aug 1995<PRE>     I actuallly don't know what my reading speed is; I do know it's
pretty fast -- I was reading at college level while in 9th grade,
according to tests at the time -- but actual speed, I don't know.  Never
took a speed reading course, though; I figure, if somebody took two years
to write a book, you shouldn't blow through it in two hours.
