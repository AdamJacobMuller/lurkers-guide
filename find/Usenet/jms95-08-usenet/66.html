<H2>Attn JMS: Butterfly Costumes</H2>
14 Aug 1995<PRE>     Where Delenn gets all those wardrobe changes is one of those
questions that, in a real world, doesn't warrant close scrutiny.
 
     And yes, her costumes tend to be emblematic of where the character
is, and who she is.  Consequently, there will be some year three additions
to underscore her more assertive nature; there's a green costume in
particular that shows up in the first episode that's just *killer*.
