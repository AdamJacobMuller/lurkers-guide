<H2>Attn: JMS-What will "Official"</H2>
7 Aug 1995<PRE>     We've had some preliminary discussions about what would be on the
official B5 web page, and at the moment, I can't talk about any of the
things we have in mind until they've been realized.  Much of it is stuff
definitely not included in other web sites.  Plus some interesting
opportunities.  Be patient...we haven't dropped the ball elsewhere....
