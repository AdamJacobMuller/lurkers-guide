3 Aug 1995<PRE>     Actually, the lead guest character in the first episode of year three,
one Mr. Endawi, is a Nigerian, and our new recurring character, Marcus
Cole (a Ranger) is British, and played by Jason Carter.  So you have two
non-American accents occupying major parts of the first ep next year.
