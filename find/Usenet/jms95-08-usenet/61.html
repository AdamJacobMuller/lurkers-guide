<H2>Brits as villians (was Comes T</H2>
14 Aug 1995<PRE>     This really is one of the nuttier threads I've seen...we've had
plenty of Brits on both sides of the issue...David Warner in Grail, the
character of the Ombuds, many others, plus our new recurring character,
Marcus Cole, a Ranger played by British actor Jason Carter...I think some
people are being just a *bit* too sensitive on this.  (Also the doctor in
"Hunter/Prey" who's on the side of the angels, others.)
