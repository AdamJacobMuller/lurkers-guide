<H2>Re: Abuse of this newsgroup by</H2>
18 Aug 1995<PRE>     You know when you can tell that one side of an argument has gone
belly-up?  When they resort to inappropriate metaphor.
 
     "Well, what if jms posted a Get Rich Quick letter?  Or molested a
fan in an elevator?  Or committed murder?  Or bombed the World Trade
Center?  Or...or...or...."
 
     Because they cannot logically defend the area that is under debate,
they attempt to redefine the debate to something that is indefensible,
and *totally* irrelevant.  It's not "What if X did Y," it's "Here's X,
and let's just discuss what DID happen, not what might happen in
somebody's fevered imagination."
 
     This is SO stupid....
 
                                                                   jms
