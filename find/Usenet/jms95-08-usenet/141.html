<H2>JMS: S. Furst's schedule (was</H2>
29 Aug 1995<PRE>     The shared days, when Stephen does our show in the morning, and then
the other show in the afternoons, are only when necessary; we're using
him also during his hiatuses (hiati?) from the other show, so we have him
all day every day for as much as a week at a time.
 
     We were happy to accommodate on this because while Stephen's role
on B5 will always be important, and will grow, the role is such that Vir
will/can never be the star of the story, whereas in the sitcom he has the
chance to be the lead, and we think that's worth supporting.
