<H2>Re: Rerun the Pilot!</H2>
3 Aug 1993<PRE>     The pilot will be rerun a couple more times between now and the
series going on-line, definitely in November.  (And those who'
've been asking for x-y-z axis movement will get it, btw.)
 
     The only hesitation I have about the pilot is that the series is
going to be *much* improved, and the pilot really will no longer be a real
indication of what we have in mind.
