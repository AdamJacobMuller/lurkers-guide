14 Aug 1993<PRE>     I hate scripts that end with, "And they all laugh."  Even when I was
working in animation, I avoided them.  Thus far, all of our episodes are
slated to end with a tag, but in many cases -- and this is almost becoming
a theme or a setpiece for us -- there's a questioning element to the tag,
something unusual or offbeat that adds one other layer to what we've just
seen.
