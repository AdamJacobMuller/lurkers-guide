27 Aug 1993<PRE>     "I could swear I saw ships leaving B5 after Sinclair ordered it
closed."  To which you reply, "I agree, and I mentioned it before."
 
     Yes, you did.  Just one problem.  There ARE no such shots of any
ships entering B5.  You have some shots of ships in a holding pattern
outside, waiting until all is cleared, or heading on to secondary bases.
