<H2>Re: pilot inconsistancy</H2>
25 Aug 1993<PRE>     I'm going to try this again; for some reason, the last several notes
I sent in reply to internet stuff hasn't gotten through.
 
     The station *is* still rotating in the Vorlon attack scene.  The
camera is more or less tracking with the rotation at that moment, but it
is moving.  I was there at the early wireframe tests.
 
     As for the Vorlon handshake (so to speak)...this will be dealt with
in the series.  You have to remember that the original plan was to air the
pilot and go *immediately* into series, where we'd bring up some of these
questions.  There simply wasn't room to deal with EVERYTHING in that short
pilot...and where we DID try and cover everything, we got gigged for being
expositional.
 
     Now we have to re-establish a few things since there's been a gap in
time...but the poison incident will be raised in "The Parliament of
Dreams" script to start with, and move on from there.
