16 Aug 1993<PRE>     "But it still doesn't change the FACT that in a few hundred years,
aspirin WILL BE obsolete."
 
     Don't suppose you'd be willing to produce the Journal of the American
Medical Association for Spring 2257 to back up your statement of *fact*
in this matter, would you?
 
     The *fact* is that even now, we're re-discovering medicines and means
of healing that go back centuries.  You may state clearly and with great
confidence your opinion...but that is all that it is, it is not "fact," as
you state.
