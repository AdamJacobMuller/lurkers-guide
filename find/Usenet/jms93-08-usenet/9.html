<H2>Re: Wanted: less cheese, more</H2>
12 Aug 1993<PRE>     You repeat several times your insistence that I study TNG to see
what they did right, use them as a roadmap.
 
     Sorry.  I have no desire to study TNG.  I'm telling a different sort
of story, in a different universe.  What TNG does right or wrong is more
or less irrelevant to that universe.  That's like saying that (just to
pick two names at random) Orson Scott Card should study Poul Anderson as
a roadmap in his own novels.  This is utter nonsense.
 
     A while ago, I got an email from someone who didn't like the pilot
(and it may have been on internet, btw) mainly because of the communication
devices.  He said, and I'm paraphrasing from memory, that every time
someone used the wrist-links, it broke the illusion for him, since we all
KNOW that by then the REALITY is that we'll be using the chest
communicators that TNG uses, and I should be sure to include that in
future episodes as a capitulation to that reality.
 
     Sorry...TNG is a roadmap for TNG.  Not B5.
