<H2>Re: A thousand thanks.</H2>
14 Aug 1993<PRE>     Somebody said that what they liked about the show was the sense that
it was altogether possible that you could turn on the show one day and
find that the whole station had vanished, with the word "Crotoan"
lasered onto a nearby asteroid.  Anything can happen.
 
     And as much as possible, I'm going to try to keep playing to that
aspect.  Anyone is fair game.  Characters should turn around, and become
something other than what they seem to be.  And there can be even larger
changes wrought on the whole tapestry of the show, some of which will show
up in a *very* major way late in the third season.  I like pulling the
rug out from under people.
