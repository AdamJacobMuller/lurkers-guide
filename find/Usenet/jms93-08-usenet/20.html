<H2>Questions for JMS</H2>
19 Aug 1993<PRE>     Insofar as I know, Walker is mainly features PR and some network PR;
we fall under the PTEN jurisdiction, so I don't think he's involved.  I
don't yet know how much promotional material will be made available; it's
a long ways until we go on the air, so there's time for that to get put
together.
 
     For those who want to send mail to B5, best to use this address:
14431 Ventura Boulevard, Suite 260, Sherman Oaks, CA 91423.  My name or
B5 will suffice.
