<H2>Re: A little scenario</H2>
27 Aug 1993<PRE>     Excuse me for being blunt, but since you're being blunt, you
shouldn't mind a blunt observation in return.
 
     You are an idiot.
 
     I have no problem with someone finding genuine faults with a show,
mine or otherwise...but it's something else again to *manufacture* faults,
and then make them into errors.  I feel a little like Woody Allen in
MANHATTAN, listening to the fellow behind him in line mouthing on and on
about Marshall McCluhan's work, all of it absolutely wrong, until finally
Allen drags Marshall out from behind the nearest wall to say to him, in
essence, "You are an idiot."
 
     You say, taking this as your premise, "it's pretty clear that a
Vorlon is the standard 'shimmering-electric-blue energy creature that just
happens to be humanoid.'"  No, it's not.  I don't care what you think,
that is most definitely NOT what Kosh is.  So all of your error-finding
based on that assumption is strictly nonsense.  I'm just amazed that you
can sit there and say, "Oh, yes, this is what it is," when it's not, and
at this moment only three people in the WORLD know what a Vorlon is.
 
     You say that the Minbari "of course...should have had NO contact
with them."  That's your assumption.  Your assumption is deadass wrong.
Note how Delenn comes forth and bows to the Vorlon.  There is some
familiarity there.  We will be finding out just HOW much familiarity there
is down the road.  That's what we have the series for.  To develop these
kinds of things.
 
     You complain about things you think are obvious (and by the way,
you're wrong in THAT message as well), but things that are subtle seem to
rocket over your head at something just short of lightspeed.
 
     And that background of familiarity DOES explain how the assassin would
know how to hurt a Vorlon.
 
     You have to understand that, despite being on televison, this is a
BOOK.  It is a novel.  You have seen only the prologue to the novel at
this juncture.  To conclude everything that will happen based strictly on
that prologue is absurd.  (And please don't throw "Well, that's all we've
HAD for a year" at me...it wasn't designed that way.  It was designed to
go immediately into series, and begin both posing and answering some of
the questions raised, so that at this moment, we wouldn't be HAVING this
discussion.  You can't blame us for a corporate decision.)
 
     So in any event, your entire 1-2-3 progression, based as it is on
completely erroneous and presumptuous assumptions is totally wrong.  You
will simply have to wait and see how it ends, as with any story.  If you
don't, if this message has pissed you off, that's life.
 
     In future, comment on *actual aspects of the production* all you
like...but try to refrain from cooking up some weird scenario in your own
mind, slapping it as an overlay onto my show, and somehow twisting things
around to make it look like we're doing something dumb, when in fact your
message doesn't touch reality at any two contiguous points.
 
     How's THAT for a review?
 
     (Oh, and a P.S. to those who parroted the comments of Jeff Jarvis at
TV Guide about the "cheesy" special effects/CGI in the B5 pilot: we just
received word that we've won an Emmy for Best Special Effects in a TV
Movie.)
