<H2>Re: A little scenario</H2>
28 Aug 1993<PRE>     What you propose in your scenario is not it...but it does show that
you're thinking along similar lines to what we're going to be doing.  That
kind of thing, and the inner workings you describe, are very close to the
surface of our story, and what we have in mind.  Or, said more succinctly:
yes, you get it.
