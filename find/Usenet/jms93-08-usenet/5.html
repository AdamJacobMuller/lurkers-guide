<H2>Wanted: Hardend Characters</H2>
5 Aug 1993<PRE>     We'll definitely be dealing with the aspects of how fighting in a war
can affect you.  And this isn't just a vague promise: watch the end of the
third (currently) scheduled episode, "Infection," for a scene between
Sinclair and Garibaldi that really deals very straightforwardly with this
issue.  It's a conversation you wouldn't expect to see in a show like this.
