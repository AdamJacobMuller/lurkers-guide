27 Aug 1993<PRE>     "Another one of those 'all alien men want Earth women' type things,
if you'll disregard the psi-stuff for now."
 
     In other words, disregard what is going to be probably one of the
most dominant themes that will emerge in the entire series.  Disregard
what you WANT to disregard in order to make a critical comment.
 
     I look forward to embarrassing the hell out of you by about this time
next year....
