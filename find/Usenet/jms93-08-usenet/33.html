<H2>Re: Babylon 5 Computer</H2>
29 Aug 1993<PRE>     What Kyle suggests...is closer to the truth than might otherwise be
suspected.  We had filmed a scene -- which never made it into the finished
pilot -- where Garibaldi, growing suspicious of his boss -- confronts
Sinclair in the core shuttle.  One of the alibis he checked out doesn't
hold up: Sinclair's.  The transport tube computer records don't indicate
any delay.  Sinclair suggests that there's either a problem with the
system, or it's been deliberately altered to remove that information.
 
     It was, of course, the latter.
 
     Now...stop and think about this for a moment.
 
     The Observation Dome has equipment to detect approaching ships.  The
spider transport approaches without being noticed.  The surface of the
station would likely have sensors to detect something attaching itself to
the hull.  Somehow these were over-ridden.  The only time that anyone
notices, up in the Dome, is later, when Laurel isn't there, interestingly
enough.  Someone deliberately programmed the transport tube to delay
Sinclair.  The assassin would have to know this in advance.
 
     We saw Londo with the assassin.  We also saw Garibaldi, Lyta,
Dr. Kyle and -- later -- Sinclair with the assassin, each relating to him
in different ways.  Who was the one person we never saw with the assassin,
whose reactions might have told us something?  Who was the one put in
charge of the station when Sinclair was pulled out of circulation?
 
     Laurel.
 
     We had some...interesting things in mind for this character.  Now
that another character has come in, some things will be modified, but
other elements will come in to replace them.
