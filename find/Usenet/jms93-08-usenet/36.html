<H2>Homosexuality in Space!</H2>
30 Aug 1993<PRE>     My feeling is that the best way of handling this question is to have
a character, someone we see more than once, who we eventually learn is
bi or gay.  This seems to me a much more intrinsically powerful statement
than doing a "gay" story.  So that's what we're going to do.
