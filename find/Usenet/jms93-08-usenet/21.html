20 Aug 1993<PRE>     Re: the skin tab/Kosh's hand/encounter suit question...one of the
reasons I can't wait for the series to get on the air is so that we can
make one thing clear, once and for all: it is NOT an error, not a plot
hole, it is a plot POINT.  It is a question that our *characters* will
be asking each other.  How can this be?  This will come up more than once,
starting with "The Parliament of Dreams" episode.
