<H2>The Known Galaxy -- How much i</H2>
15 Aug 1993<PRE>     I'm still mapping that aspect out.  We do make a distinction in the
series between space in general and "known space."  In "Infection," one
character comments that he's come "halfway across known space" to see
someone.  But the details of that are still being worked out.
