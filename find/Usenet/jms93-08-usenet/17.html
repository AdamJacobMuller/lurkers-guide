<H2>So who's Catherine Sakai?</H2>
15 Aug 1993<PRE>     Catherine Sakai is played by Julie Nickson Soul, an asian-american
actor who's done quite a bit of work in high-profile films.  Her
character is never Cathy, only Catherine (occasionally Cath to Sinclair,
but *only* occasionally).  She's a planetary surveyer, working for one
of the Earth corporations, looking for uninhabited worlds and asteroids
for exploitation.
