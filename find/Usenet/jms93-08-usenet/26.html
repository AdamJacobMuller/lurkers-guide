<H2>Confirmation requested... Koen</H2>
27 Aug 1993<PRE>     Whoever posted the note re: Walter Koenig is baldfacedly lying.
Walter was in my office just this afternoon, in fact.  He's doing well,
exercising, walking around, and looks great...a hell of a lot better than
I would look under those conditions, that's for sure.
