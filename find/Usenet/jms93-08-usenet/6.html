<H2>Wanted:  just a bit more reali</H2>
7 Aug 1993<PRE>     The main line I've been stressing with our writers and others who
we're working with is the goal of making our humans more human, and our
aliens more alien.  Much of our life is focused around things that don't
generally show up in SF television...we cut ourselves shaving, we have to
find a bathroom, our shoes don't fit...and these are the elements that
help make a character more real somehow.  So yes, we're very definitely
going for that aspect.
