<H2>Where can I find ???????</H2>
17 Aug 1993<PRE>     Beats me, but if you find an uncut version of B5, lemme know, because
I'D like one.
 
     The problem is that, unlike a motion picture, where you produce a
cut on film, which you then trim down, we're editing on computerized image
files.  We don't get around to finally cutting the film until we've made
our final edits.  So no complete version ever existed on film.  The most
that could be done is get those 25 minutes and *build* a new version with
that footage...which would require additional scoring, editing, and other
stuff.
 
     BTW...just to put the word out: someone stole a painstakingly painted
plaster cast of G'Kar -- full-size, head and neck -- from the B5 offices.
If *anyone* should offer this for sale anywhere, please be advised that
this stolen merchandise and should be reported.
