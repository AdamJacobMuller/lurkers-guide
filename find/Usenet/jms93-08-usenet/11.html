<H2>Upcoming Conventions?</H2>
13 Aug 1993<PRE>     I'll be at both WorldCon in San Francisco the first part of
September, and at Comic Con in a week or so.  I'll be bringing the same
basic material to both places, so you don't have to do both.  But I can
promise you'll find it interesting.  At this point, in addition, it looks
like Michael O'Hare, Jerry Doyle, and Harlan Ellison will also be doing
the SDCC B5 presentation as well.
