<H2>Various Topics</H2>
13 Aug 1993<PRE>     1) Language.  We don't have a universal translator.  You either have
to speak English, Interlac, or Centauri, the three dominant languages.  If
not, then you have to use a mechanical translator, which isn't set up for
every brand new language they encounter.  I'd like to showcase at least
one episode in which communication is really a problem.
 
     2) Yes, for the most part, we're looking at humanoids...but not in
all cases.  Look for one character in particular, n'grath, who will make
his/its first appearance in the second episode.  This thing definately
ain't human.
 
     3) We have some interesting ideas for what can happen to the energy
question.
 
     4) Our crew members do what they're assigned to do, what their rank
and designation specifies they should do.
