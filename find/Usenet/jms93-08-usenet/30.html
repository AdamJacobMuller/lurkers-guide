<H2>Re: A little scenario</H2>
28 Aug 1993<PRE>     Actually, it's Kosh's ship that comes out of the jump gate backward,
engines forward to assist with deceleration.  The fighters don't want to
be slow-moving targets, so it stands to reason they wouldn't be
configured for rapid deceleration.  They want to get into position as fast
as possible.
