<H2>Re: inconsistancy in pilot</H2>
28 Aug 1993<PRE>     There was a reason we gave Londo the pilot opening monologue, yes.
And another reason why we're giving Sinclair the opening monologue over
credits of the first season, though with some differences.  We're also
considering rotating any such opening between other cast members as well,
but *always* in the past-tense, "Babylon 5 *was*...."  We're dealing in
future history here, and we plan to do some interesting things with that
aspect.
