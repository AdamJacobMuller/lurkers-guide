<H2>ATTN JMS: Loose threads...</H2>
30 Dec 1994<PRE>     1) The first B5 novel is due out from Dell in January, from John
Vornholt.

     2) The Grimjack movie is awaiting final negotiations between the
various parties, and for me to clear out some room on my desk to be able
to do the script justice.

     3) I'm finishing the first draft of one SF series pilot movie over
the brief Christmas break, due for one of the major cable networks; another
project is awaiting some executive decisions.  (These things take time;
B5 took five years.)

     4) I'm hoping we'll see videotapes of B5 out by spring for the first
season, laserdisks to follow maybe summer or fall.
