28 Dec 1994<PRE>     If you like those kinds of character flips, you're gonna love the
next batch of episodes....

     There are some real surprises in there, some relating back to first
season stuff, and characters.

     It's easiest to flip a character when the story elsewhere is fairly
straightforward, so you lull the audience in with a sense of "okay, this
is the story, nothing major, shouldn't change anything," then you whap
them hard when they're not looking.  So whenever you see a jms script,
and there doesn't seem like there's that much to it...be careful.  The
simpler the premise -- just a visit by someone to the station, someone
taken prisoner and trying to escape -- the more you're being set up.

     It's kinda like the nak'a'leen feeder...as long as you can hear it,
you're safe...but the moment you hear nothing....
