<H2>JMS:Who watchers the watchmen?</H2>
16 Dec 1994<PRE>     "Who watches the watchmen" is an old Latin phrase, sometimes
translated as "who guards the guards?"  Given sufficient time I could
probably dig up the origin of the phrase; it's fairly common.

     And thanks re: Ivanova...she's a hoot.  (And btw, Claudia and I are
tentatively set to do a Horizons convention in England around Apilr or
(er, make that April or) May.

                                                                jms
