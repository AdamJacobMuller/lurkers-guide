<H2>ATTN JMS:  renewal notice when</H2>
7 Dec 1994<PRE>     If we bombed in November, we'd get NO.  If we did good, we'd get
Maybe.  So far, we're still (happily) in Maybe.  We likely won't know
for sure though until March/April.

                                                                   jms
