<H2>B5 CD Booklet: Why stiff O'Har</H2>
20 Dec 1994<PRE>      I was actually kinda surprised by the omission myself; I do believe
there's a photo of Michael in there (him and Jerry standing in front of
the big fan set)...I can only assume that it was done under the current
licensing, and that department sent him what was to be on there.

                                                                       jms
