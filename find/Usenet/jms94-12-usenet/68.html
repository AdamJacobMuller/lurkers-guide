<H2>Is JMS a Vorlon?</H2>
14 Dec 1994<PRE>     Yeah, a lot of my posts are dated in the wee hours, 1-3 a.m. or
thereabouts; sometimes later.  (Though a few, like this one, are a bit
more ordinary.)  You have to understand the schedule: I get to the
studio early, I try to be on stage for filming as much as I can, then
there's casting, meetings, editing, mixing, tone discussions with
directors, on and on and on...then I come home around 8 p.m. or so, grab
a fast bite, go into my office, write scripts until around midnight or
one (occasionally blipping onto the modem while the dinosaur part of my
brain tries to work out a story point), then do the bulk of my modeming
live and on-line from then through the wee hours.  Then I crash and do it
all over again the next day.  (I can use Tapcis for some off-line
composing, but all my GEnie stuff and Internet stuff is written on-line,
since the GEnie gateway can't handle offline stuff; once I've read a
message here, it vanishes from my mailbox.)
