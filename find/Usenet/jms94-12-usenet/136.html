<H2>Peter David does it again.</H2>
26 Dec 1994<PRE>     You mean like showing two of our command staff in the men's room
taking a whiz?  (Oops, sorry, we already did that one.)  Maybe having the
command staff talk about their zippers.  (Oops, did that one, too.)

      Just thought of several others, but we've done those, too.

      This show is about *people*, not statues or icons.  And it's in the
little details, hassles, and physicality that we are reminded of their
frailities and humanity...and see a little of ourselves in the process.
