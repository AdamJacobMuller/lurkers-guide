<H2>Moving Stars (One More Time...</H2>
13 Dec 1994<PRE>     Because the window is so large, making a revolving cyclorama with
fiber-optic stars is physically impossible.  Doing matte composites for
the lengthy shots which generally take place in C&amp;C is also impossible;
we could spend time rendering all those shots, but then wouldn't have
time to render any OTHER CGI for the show.  We're still looking for a
better solution, but for now, it is what it is.

                                                                    jms
