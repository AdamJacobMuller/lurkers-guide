<H2>Thanks, JMS, for your guest st</H2>
13 Dec 1994<PRE>     McCallum was *very* pleasant to work with, very unassuming and
quiet.  We've been very lucky with our guest stars; they have a strong
respect for the text, and don't stray.  And they bring a lot to each
performance.  On the subject of genre actors...they often created great
characters, so memorable that they got typecast, and couldn't find work.
This to me is a crime, and if we can cast them in ways totally opposite
what they've done before (Koenig as Bester), and show the real range and
skill these actors possess, we pay back a little of what they've given
us, which we kinda owe them, I think.  It's simply a gesture of respect.


     (Our first season, when Walter did his episode, when he would come
to the lunch table -- all writers, producers, crew and actors eat
together at the stage every day -- all the other cast members used to
stand until he'd sat...tradition for a senior officer.)

                                                                        jms
