<H2>Hey, Joe-TV38 is moving B5 all</H2>
27 Dec 1994<PRE>     The ratings are strong, but the ratings are also a function of when
the show is aired.  Move the show around a lot, and the ratings will fall
on any show, because folks can't find it.  Sometimes it's accidental,
sometimes not.  "It is *life*" -- Zathras.
