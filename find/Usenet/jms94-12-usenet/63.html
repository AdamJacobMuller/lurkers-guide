<H2>Re: What about the new viewers</H2>
14 Dec 1994<PRE>     One of the focus groups done by Warners had the same reaction from
one of the people; that B5 was too much a drama, too much character stuff,
and not enough of what SF is.  So he was asked what he considered SF to
be.  He lit right up and said, "Power Rangers."

     I almost went for him, right through the two-way glass....
