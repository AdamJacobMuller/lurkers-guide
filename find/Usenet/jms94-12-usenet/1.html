<H2>Ship Names (minor ADS spoiler)</H2>
1 Dec 1994<PRE>     So tell me, Ligia, if Cortez had NOT landed in northern Mexico, do
you think it would have remained undiscovered until now?

     Fact #1: somebody was bound to discover the Americas.

     Fact #2: any sufficiently advanced civilization or culture will
inevitably attempt to exploit any civilization or culture not sufficiently
advanced to fight back on a level playing field.

     Blaming explorers for exploring has always seemed to me really kind
of silly; do people *really* think that if Columbus hadn't landed here,
it'd be 1994 and we still wouldn't know the world was round and that
this continent was here?  It doesn't matter who discovered it, the same
result would've come.  Somebody had to discover it sooner or later.

                                                                          jms
