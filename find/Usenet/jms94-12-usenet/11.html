<H2>Is B5 really the "best hope fo</H2>
7 Dec 1994<PRE>     This is, of course, one of the great ironies of any free society,
that in order to BE a free society you have to create the very conditions
that could turn right around and destroy that freedom.  You have to
allow things you don't like in the hope that there are enough checks and
balances, and enough attractions to the current system to encourage
folks not to change over.  (I think it was Che Guevara who said that
every nation is three meals short of revolution.)

     I keep playing with the notion of an opening narration a year or two
down the road that says, "the Babylon Project was our last, best hope for
peace.  It failed."

                                                                       jms
