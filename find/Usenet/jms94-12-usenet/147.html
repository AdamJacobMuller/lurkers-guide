<H2>B-5 Comic Sold Out?</H2>
27 Dec 1994<PRE>     You were told wrong.  The book has sold very well, and DC is
committed to further improving the project, both in terms of artwork, and
quality in general (such as going to a better stock of paper in another
issue or two, which won't bleed the color so much).
