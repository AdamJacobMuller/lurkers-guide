<H2>Re: Universal Moral code and G</H2>
18 Dec 1994<PRE>     The idea of getting all sentient life forms, human and alien alike,
to agree on a UNIVERSAL MORAL CODE is utterly impossible.  Hell, get 15
people together and have them decide on where to go for LUNCH can take
you *days*.  The UN brought forth a Universal Bill of Human Rights, and
there are STILL nations that haven't signed it, don't agree with it.  Can
you imagine the GREATER differences of opinion when you start bringing
non-humans into the equation?
