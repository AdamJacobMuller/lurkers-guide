<H2>JMS: What does Harlan do?</H2>
10 Dec 1994<PRE>     Harlan does on the show whatever he *wants* to do on the show.  He
helped create the Ombuds character, added to the narration, does the
final VO on the credits, sometimes talks with other writers about the
show...he's our own personal free-floating agent of chaos....
