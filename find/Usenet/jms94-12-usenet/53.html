<H2>Attn JMS (was Re: Is B5 really</H2>
13 Dec 1994<PRE>     And in my more evil moments, in light of the analysis of "it was the
dawn of the third age of mankind," I'm constantly fighting the temptation
to have someone show up at the station with his young daughter in tow and
say, "This is Dawn.  She's three."

     Just to watch everyone's antennae explode....

     (This to Dawn Sharon, who reminded me of it.)
