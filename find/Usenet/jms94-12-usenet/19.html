<H2>"The Long Dark" Review -- Spoi</H2>
7 Dec 1994<PRE>     RE: Londo looking "more wicked," we're doing some very small,
subtle things to his appearance, his wardrobe, pulling him into a
darker range of fabrics.  (Honest to god, you wouldn't believe how
careful and detailed we are in setting this stuff up.)  He'll even be
getting a new, slightly darker coat, straighter lines, closer in style
to Refa's, before the season's out.  It's really interesting when you
know where you're going....
