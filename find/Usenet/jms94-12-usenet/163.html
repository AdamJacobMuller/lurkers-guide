29 Dec 1994<PRE>     What gets posted on the B5 Buzzboard is mainly reactions to specific
episodes, analyses of where the story may be going...understand that
making TV is like yelling into a vacuum; there's no feedback other than
the ratings, so folks take any chance they can to see how viewers react.
