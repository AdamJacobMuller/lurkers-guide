<H2>JMS: the original concept for</H2>
22 Dec 1994<PRE>     Yes, since you've sussed it...the plan was to turn Delenn from
male to female in "Chrysalis," in my original plans, as well as making
her half-human.  And yes, it would've had one hell of an impact...but my
concern when I made that decision not do do this back in the pilot was
based on the reality that we couldn't do it well.  The "male" voice,
altered by computer-enhancement, just sounded REAL bogus; we couldn't
get it right, and I had to decide between dropping it, and doing something
the people would rightly describe as lame all season, just for one big
payoff.  It was a tough call, but it had to be made.
