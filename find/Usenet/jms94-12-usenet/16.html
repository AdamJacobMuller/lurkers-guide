<H2>Sinclair Who? or The Long Dark</H2>
7 Dec 1994<PRE>     Re: Sheridan...thanks, and I think you'll continue to like him more
the deeper we get into the season and we discover what's *really* going
on with him.  Last season, "Chrysalis" was the episode at season's end
that kind of turned the show on its head; this season it starts a LOT
sooner than that...there are several episodes mid-season that whop the
series upside the head and send it spinning in a very different direction,
and they mainly involve Sheridan.  In particular, watch for "A Race
Through Dark Places," "The Coming of Shadows," "All Alone in the Night"
(which is a biggie, though it's designed NOT to look like that for most
of the episode), "Acts of Sacrifice" and "Hunter, Prey."  With one or
two exceptions, they run in a block come February.
