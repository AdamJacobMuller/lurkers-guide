14 Dec 1994<PRE>     I hear they're going to print a slightly edited (minus the more
inflammatory stuff, I was in a bad mood at the time) version of my letter
in their magazine, with a note from the editor to the effect that he will
maybe give B5 "another chance."

                                                                         jms
