<H2>JMS - Are Most T.V. Writers Ti</H2>
9 Dec 1994<PRE>     Television writers do, and risk, as much as the industry will allow
them to.  The television business inclines one toward timidity, toward
not making trouble, to the lowest common denominator.  The few that rise
above that are those willing to take a stand and risk losing everything
if they mess up (Bochco, Kelley, others).
