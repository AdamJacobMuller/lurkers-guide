<H2>JMS: Other comic stories</H2>
14 Dec 1994<PRE>     Part of me wants to follow the other characters from the pilot, but
another part of me knows that only a relatively small portion of B5
viewers have actually *seen* the pilot, and it might kinda lose them.  I
dunno, still considering it.

                                                                       jms
