<H2>ATTN JMS: ? Re: Futurequest PB</H2>
20 Dec 1994<PRE>     Yep, the folks at Futurequest asked if we could donate our stages
for their use when we weren't using them, and we said yes.  (So far I've
seen part of our central corridor, and the dome tech's pit in C&amp;C.)

                                                                        jms
