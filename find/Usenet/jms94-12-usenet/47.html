<H2>JMS: your faves</H2>
13 Dec 1994<PRE>     So far the best episodes of this year (in my view) are those in the
next batch, starting January/February.  (My favorite from the first
group is "Geometry.")  I think "The Coming of Shadows" may be the best
(or at least my favorite) from the entire series to date.  I'd also put
"Chrysalis," "Babylon Squared," "A Race Through Dark Places" and
"Revelations" toward the top.  I suspect that "All Alone in the Night"
will be up there, but I just today got the director's cut, and haven't
seen it yet, though the dailies were terrific.

                                                                   jms
