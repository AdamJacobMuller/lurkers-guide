<H2>Boxleitner, the new William Sh</H2>
7 Dec 1994<PRE>     First people complained that Sinclair wasn't expressive enough; now
they complain that Sheridan's TOO expressive...Sinclair smiled too much,
then he was too serious...now Sheridan smiles too much....

     The Canadian TV Guide said Sheridan was as "wooden" as Shatner; now
he's called as overly expressive as Shatner....

     I dunno...maybe the hangup some people have with Shatner is the
problem...and maybe they ought to get over it.

                                                                        jms
