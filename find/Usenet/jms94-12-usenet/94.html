<H2>UK:Channel 4 latest</H2>
20 Dec 1994<PRE>     I'm piggy-backing this note to a UK letter in order to reach our
friends across the pond.

     Hullo!

     I have a question/favor to ask.

     There's a puppet kid's show that aired in the US around the early
1960s that was made in England.  There it was called "Space Patrol," but
here it was called "Planet Patrol" to distinguish it from another show
called "Space Patrol."  I've been looking for copies of this show for
literally decades; I've only found one.  I would be willing to make
whatever arrangements necessary to get additional copies of this show.

     (Hey, it was my fave show as a kid, what can I say...?)

	                                                                    jms
