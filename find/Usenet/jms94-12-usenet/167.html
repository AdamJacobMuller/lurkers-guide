<H2>ATTN JMS: Psi Corps Question</H2>
30 Dec 1994<PRE>     There are genetic tests that check for the gene, which can be present
or recessive; also, there's a network by which people who think they are
telepathic, and thus troubled, can contact the Corps for help.  The
vast majority of PC members come to them in very early childhood.
