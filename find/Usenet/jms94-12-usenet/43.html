11 Dec 1994<PRE>     Yes, Conaway will be seen from time to time in the show.

     We get a *very* good selection of name actors, many of whom don't
generally do syndication (not at what we can afford to pay, much less
than ST has), but they're generally drawn by the material.  At least
that's what they tell me, and out of convenience and hubris I have come
to accept it as true.

                                                                     jms
