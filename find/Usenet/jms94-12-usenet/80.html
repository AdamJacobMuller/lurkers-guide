<H2>Attn. JMS:  JMS as Father Chri</H2>
17 Dec 1994<PRE>     Okay, let's see, what can I tell you to tide you over...the next
six new episodes that'll run are, in order, "A Race Through Dark Places,"
"The Coming of Shadows," "GROPOS," "All Alone in the Night," and "Acts of
Sacrifice," with "Hunter, Prey" being the final new one in that cycle.

     I can say that all of those episodes (with the nominal exception of
"GROPOS," which though it is a solid arc episode doesn't change the
overall direction of the series) are stories that have major and
substantial effects on the show's direction. In season one, we built all
season to maybe three major WHAM episodes.  ("Sky," "Signs," "Chrysalis.")
This year we have double that number at minimum, and with greater impact.

     All of our major characters will start going through major
upheavals in their lives during this period.  It's a *very* intense six
weeks.  Several characters make decisions that completely change the
direction of the show, and the way their character fits in with the
series.  One episode will look very much unconnected to the arc until the
last five minutes, at which point there's a revelation that will likely
astonish some and confirm suspcions for some other viewers.

     Simply put, by the end of those six episodes, in many ways the show
you're used to isn't the same anymore, and the relationships between
several major characters simply aren't the same anymore.  And most
interesting for me is that we get to push some of the characters'
emotions to the very edge...and snap them.

     These six represent some of the strongest episodes we've ever done;
I consider "Coming" to be probably the best episode to date.  In "GROPOS"
we're going for broke and are doing some *amazing* CGI stuff.

     How's that for a start?

                                                                         jms
