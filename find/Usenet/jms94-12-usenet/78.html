<H2>ATTN JMS:  Is B5 doomed?</H2>
16 Dec 1994<PRE>     You're mixing apples and oranges; it may be tied for 20 with ALL
show, but you're including talk shows, and game shows, and Entertainment
Tonight.  In the ratings, you break out categories; and we're the third
rated dramatic series, #3 out of 16 or 17.  And our demographics are
stellar.  So things are looking very good right now.

     Seeing numbers is one thing, but you have to know how they are
interpreted by ad agencies and networks for it to count.

                                                                  jms
