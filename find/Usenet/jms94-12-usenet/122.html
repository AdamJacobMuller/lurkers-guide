22 Dec 1994<PRE>     Re: repeat performances (or is that re: peat performance)...I said
just about all I could think of to say.  The show really has to speak for
itself, and most of anything I'd have to say should be said there.  I
don't tend to do a lot of interviews; I generally okay about one out of
every twenty or so requests.  Don' wanna be no star.  The story is the
star, and the actors are the stars.

     To quote Meatloaf, "I ain't in it for the power, And I ain't in it
for my health, I ain't in it for the glory of anything at all, And I sure
ain't in it for the wealth."
