<H2>JMS: Pronouncing "Ivanova"</H2>
28 Dec 1994<PRE>     I've known Russians who've used the same kind of pronunciation we
have given Ivanova.  It does vary.  Heck, my name is pronounced
STRUH-ZIN-SKI, when it *should* be correctly pronounced STRA-CHIN-SKI.
Both are acceptable.  And you get different pronunciations in central
Russia from places like byelorussia or the more Eastern provinces.
