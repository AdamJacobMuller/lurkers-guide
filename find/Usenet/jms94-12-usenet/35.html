<H2>Theron: WE WANT PROOF. OR, SHA</H2>
10 Dec 1994<PRE>     I hate to be the one to point this out, but B5's ratings have been
steadily on the rise now for weeks; in fact, the President of WB/PTEN
distribution came here to the stage this week to congratulate everyone
involved with the show.  We're the 3rd rated dramatic series overall,
in both ratings and demographics, and the demos are *killer*.  Our last
rating for "Long Dark" gave us a 5.2, which will definitely put us in
the top 18 or even 15 of ALL syndicated shows.

                                                                        jms
