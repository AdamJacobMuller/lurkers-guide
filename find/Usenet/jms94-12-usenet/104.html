<H2>JMS-Demon Night</H2>
20 Dec 1994<PRE>     Thanks.  For a first novel, DEMON NIGHT is okay; learned a lot
doing it.  Mainly just wrote it for myself, when I couldn't find the sort
of book I wanted to read, then when finished, shoved it in the closet and
left it there for about 2 years, when my agent said I should really write
a book someday.  I said that I had, just for myself.  She asked to read
it, loved it, sent it to an agent affiliate of hers, the agent in NY sent
it to an editor, and the first one who read it, bought it.  Go figure....
