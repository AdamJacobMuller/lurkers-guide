<H2>JMS: Exercise on B5?</H2>
23 Dec 1994<PRE>     Actually, bear in mind that while C&amp;C is one-third G, the rest of
the station is not, and the closer you get to the hull, the greater the
gravity.  If Ivanova wants to experience one-g, she doesn't have to use
exercise machines, she just has to go down to the right level.

     Not entirely unrelated, though, we're figuring on gradually working
our way to showing exercise, sports and sporting events on B5; just want
to be sure that when we do it, it looks right.
