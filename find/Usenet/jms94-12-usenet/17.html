<H2>JMS: This show of yours, "Baby</H2>
7 Dec 1994<PRE>     Well, it's good to know all those electives in college came in
handy SOMEWHERE....

     (I think I racked up enough electives in philosophy to come close
to a major; as it was I minored in philosophy and literature in my first
two degrees.)

     There's a vast wealth of literature, poety, ideas, philosophy, that
people -- average viewers -- know nothing about, because they may have
been led to think it's dry,and dusty, and irrelevent, and less than
interesting.  So if I can slip that in, and make it interesting, and
encourage them to seek out this stuff (I can't tell you how many folks
have written me to mention they checked out  Yeats and Tennyson based on
seeing it in this show), then we're doing something worthwhile.

                                                                jms
