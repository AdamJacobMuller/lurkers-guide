<H2>Church of Chris Carter  WAS:</H2>
31 Dec 1994<PRE>     Waitaminnit...just wait one friggin' minute...is or is not the Chris
Carter of teleport.com who logs on here, to whom I've communicated on
numerous occasions, THE Chris Carter of X-Files, or another?  If the
answer is "another," that's a *terrible* thing to do to me; if the answer
is yes....

     Yo!  Chris!  (waving arms)  There are maybe two or three shows each
week that I endeavor to catch; yours is one of them.  Absolutely terrific.
 Terrific writing and performances, and some *very* nice cinematography
and direction.  Probably one of the best shows around.  It's one of the
few shows that, if we miss it, we'll call around to all our friends (both
of them) and see if they taped X-Files.

     Good to see somebody else doing it *right* out there.
