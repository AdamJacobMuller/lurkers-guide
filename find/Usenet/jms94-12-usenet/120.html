<H2>Re: Symbolism vs. Functionalit</H2>
22 Dec 1994<PRE>     To the notion that there's no symbolism or ritual in the ways humans
do things like cleansing oneself (unless, of course, you're from India,
where there is a very real sense of ritual to these things), such
symbolism can always be *introduced* into the routine.

     Say, by showering with a chicken.

     Works for me.

                                                                                jms
