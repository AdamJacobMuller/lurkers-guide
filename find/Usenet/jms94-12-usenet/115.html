<H2>JMS: Language in the comic?</H2>
21 Dec 1994<PRE>     The word "bastards" was in the script I turned in to DC.  It got
changed to "demons" by the editor.  That change was made at the last
minute; all the inked and penciled versions I'd seen before had the right
word in it.  I'm considerably less than thrilled about it.

                                                                           jms
