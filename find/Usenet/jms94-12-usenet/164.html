<H2>JMS: Cost of production CAPT P</H2>
30 Dec 1994<PRE>     The cost of an average POWER episode was supposed to be about
$500,000 (for a half-hour show), but often ranged into $650,000 per half
hour, which puts it WAY above B5 today on a per-hour basis.  It was such
out-of-control costs that led me to wonder if one could design an SF show
so that it could be done SENSIBLY....
