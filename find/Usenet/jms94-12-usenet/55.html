<H2>ATTN JMS: Tom McDevitt tribute</H2>
14 Dec 1994<PRE>     Actually, it was caused by a charity SFWA auction; I bought the
rights to have a ship named after me in Tom's new book (at that time).
Ed Bryant was the auctioneer, who snared me into a bidding war with a
woman with an even longer name than mine, finally provoking me with, "If
you were a REAL man you'd jump another hundred dollars and shut her down."

     I'm such a stooge....
