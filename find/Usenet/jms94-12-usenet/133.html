<H2>ATTN JMS:  Where did episode #</H2>
25 Dec 1994<PRE>     207 is "A Race Through Dark Places," guest-starring Walter Koenig.
Because 207 required extra post-production work, and we wanted to bang
in with a good name guest star at the top of our next batch of new eps,
we moved 208 "Soul Mates" down one, as the last of the batch just aired.
Everyone at PTEN was notified of this, but somehow somebody didn't get
the word, and misinformation got out.  So for the week of January 23rd,
that'll be "Race," followed by the rest pretty much in production
sequence.
