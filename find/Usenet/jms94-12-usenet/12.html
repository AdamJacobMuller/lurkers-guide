<H2>Spider in the Web CC fiasco no</H2>
7 Dec 1994<PRE>     Apparently there was a mixup on PTEN's side as to the order of
episodes, and there wasn't time to get this one CC'd for the first
airing, though it *will* be close-captioned for the rebroadcast.

                                                                 jms
