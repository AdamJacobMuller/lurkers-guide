21 Dec 1994<PRE>     I seem to vaguely recall someone mentioning to me about maybe
wanting to be interviewed on FutureQuest; I just wasn't sure what I would
have to say that would be the least interest to anyone.  All of the really
interesting stuff comes out of my characters' mouths.  You gotta
understand, the overwhelming reaction upon meeting me is that there's
less here than meets the eye.  Stick a camera in front of my face and I
end up just standing there, finger in ear, going bibble-bibble-bibble
until it's over.

                                                                    jms
