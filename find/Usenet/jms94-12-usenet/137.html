<H2>More concerns regarding the se</H2>
27 Dec 1994<PRE>     ...sigh....

     Nobody at the network has been messing with the show.  My general
feeling is that at the start of a new season, you're going to get a lot
of new people to the show, sampling it, and you want to bring them in
gradually.  (And as it is, there's been a LOT about the shadows in the
first batch of episodes, in "Revelations," in "The Long Dark," and in
other episodes.)

     The first seven episodes were mainly to introduce Sheridan, and to
ease in the new folks.  The next six new ones are *extremely* intense, and
get into ALL the areas you said you wanted to see, from Santiago to the
Psi Corps to the Shadow, you name it.

     I don't think a show like this can be rushed; people tend to get
impatient, which is understandable.  This show will get where it's going,
but it'll have to do so at its own pace.
