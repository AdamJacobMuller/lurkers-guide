<H2>Re: Favorite B5 lines</H2>
31 Dec 1994<PRE>     One of my favorite exchanges, which never seems to show up, is from
PoD v.1, when G'Kar says to Tu'Pari, who has come looking for Ambassador
G'Kar, "This is Ambassador G'Kar's quarters.  This is Ambassador G'Kar's
table.  This is Ambassador G'Kar's dinner.  What part of this progression
escapes you?"

     Favorite line in the next new episode, from Sheridan: "I'm not saying
what I'm saying.  I'm not saying what I'm *thinking*.  For that matter,
I'm not even *thinking* what I'm thinking."
