<H2>Re: Universal Moral code and G</H2>
21 Dec 1994<PRE>     Eric: I will now collapse your 114 line message into what you were
trying to say behind the fog of words: you want YOUR belief system
to be the primary one portrayed, because yours is the truth, and the rest
are, as you say, "bullshit."

     So get your own damned show...aside, of course, from the hundreds of
hours of religious programming *already* filling the airwaves and cable
systems every day of the year.

     Sorry, but I'm under no obligation whatsoever to reinforce your or
anyone else's particular idea of what the Truth is.  And your particular
breed of intolerance is on of the uglier aspects of modern christianity.

                                                                         jms
