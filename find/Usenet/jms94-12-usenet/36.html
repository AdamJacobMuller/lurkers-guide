10 Dec 1994<PRE>     Excuse me, but has *anyone* here considered that Sheridan just might
still be talking to the same tech he was speaking to not *five seconds
earlier*?  He wasn't talking to himself, so much, or the audience, though
the push-in (the only shot we had) worked against that.  He *was* talking
to the tech.  Honest.

                                                                        jms
