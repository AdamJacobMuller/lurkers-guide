<H2>What repercussions ? Opinions</H2>
27 Dec 1994<PRE>     And here the same, as just noted earlier.

     We're only seven episodes into the new season; you have to build up
to some of this stuff.  Episodes 8 - 13 should satisfy just about all of
your requests.  And then some.  B5 is a novel, and like any novel you have
to  have little diversions and asides along the way to continue to bulid
(build) the universe and your characters.  The deeper you get into it, the
fewer of those you get.  But we ain't nearly that deep yet.
