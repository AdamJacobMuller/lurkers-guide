<H2>jms:interaction on net?</H2>
7 Dec 1994<PRE>     I appreciate the thought, Roxanna; I guess my main concern isn't
so much nitpicking, that's part of the game going in; it's just whether
or not my presence in an unregulated environment brings in so many
poison darts from trollers and those out to make a hassle that it ruins
it for others.
