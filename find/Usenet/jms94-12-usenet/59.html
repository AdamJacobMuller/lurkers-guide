<H2>JMS: save $$ on CC? (was: Spid</H2>
14 Dec 1994<PRE>     Unfortunately, the CC company isn't set up to handle those kinds of
files.  (And btw, we don't handle that directly; WB/PTEN makes the deal
with the CC company.)  Generally, on the rare occasions when it isn't on
first-run, it IS cc'd on the second run.

                                                                          jms
