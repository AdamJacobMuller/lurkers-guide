<H2>JMS: What about Projectile Wea</H2>
21 Dec 1994<PRE>     I have no objection to showing mass drivers, and the main problem
with projectile weapons inside the station is that they have a nasty
tendency to breach the hull, eliminating both parties.  Though you will
see some projectile-type weapons used elsewhere around the first part of
February.
