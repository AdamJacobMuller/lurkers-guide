30 Dec 1994<PRE>     On the whole Trek/B5 thing, here's something to ponder....

     Over the Christmas break, my associate, Doug Netter (also an exec
producer on the show) was staying at a hotel in New York.  One day, as he
was going up in the elevator from the garage below, who gets in at the
first floor but....Patrick Stewart.  Doug introduces himself.  Patrick
is pleased to meet him, and mentions that he likes Babylon 5 quite a bit;
that he thinks it has great promise, is constantly improving, and wishes
it only good fortune.  He even invited Doug to tea, but Doug had family
engagements, and had to pass.

     Passed along for whatever use that piece of information may be....
