27 Dec 1994<PRE>     P.S.  It occurs to me to correct what may be perceived as the tone
of my reply, sent seconds ago.  I just answered the same question on
another system (though that one was phrased rather...aggressively), and
upon seeing it not fifteen minutes later, I just sorta sighed at it.
It's a valid question, and I hope my tone didn't imply otherwise.
