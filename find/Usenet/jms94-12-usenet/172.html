<H2>JMS: B-5 in chicago?</H2>
31 Dec 1994<PRE>     WPWR is becoming a Paramount station, yes; I believe, though, that
B5 is being moved to another day, so should still be there.

     (Just because I'm curious by nature...noting that your sig line
indicates sysop of the National Islamic BBS...is there much notice of B5
among the Islamic community?  I'm told that in some areas in Iraq and
Iran, where some are able to pick up B5 off the satellite link, the show
is known and responded to well, particularly since this is a Western show
which is set in Babylon, which makes it a positive place.  [I believe,
but am willing to be corrected, that both Iran and Iraq tend to claim
Babylon for their own, though those who live there tend to feel very
independent of both sides.]  Is there much awareness of the program among
the American Islamic community, which you're probably more plugged-into,
given the nature of your BBS?  I've had several letters from people
noting, accurately, that Minbari comes from the word minbar, the pulpit
in a mosque.  Anyway, just curious....)
