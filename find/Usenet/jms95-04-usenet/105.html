<H2>There All The Honor Lies -- SP</H2>
22 Apr 1995<PRE>     So after I'd read Peter's script, and decided to go with it, he
asked about Ivanova's line, "This isn't some kind of Deep Space franchise,
this place is ABOUT something."
 
     "Are you really going to use that?" he asked.
 
     "Absolutely," I said.  "It's fall-down funny."
 
     Long pause.  "You people really ARE dangerous over there, aren't you?"
 
                                                                      jms
