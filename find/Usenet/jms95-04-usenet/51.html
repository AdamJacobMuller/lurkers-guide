<H2>Station slot changes - one man</H2>
16 Apr 1995<PRE>     There are no guarantees this side of the grave.  But the end of this
story will be told, no matter what.  At this moment, things look very good
for year three, and we'll know by month's end.  If we continue to add
viewers, as we're doing, there shouldn't be a problem seeing it through.
