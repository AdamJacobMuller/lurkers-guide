<H2>Re: What's up with Babcom 95 ?</H2>
11 Apr 1995<PRE>     As it happens, I've had occasion to have several long talks with the
Babcom organizers, and have nudged them more in the direction of doing more
of the things one might expect at a fan-con: more interaction, more
personalization, breaking down the walls a bit.  Some of the things now
under discussion: a more relaxed social situation, close to an ice cream
social sort of thing, so it isn't all just a presentation; a personal
Q&amp;A session about breaking into TV; Peter has spoken to them about letting
folks watch as the Optic Nerve people make him up into Londo; and others.
Again, these are still in the conversation stage, but my sense to try and
encourage them toward a more personalized and fan-responsive format.
