<H2>From JMS re: Poster Request</H2>
5 Apr 1995<PRE>     As has been noted, a number of items were sold at Vulkon in Cleveland
that should not have been sold.  We're trying to acquire some of the
posters that were being sold at the Big Bang table, specifically the ones
marked that they were to benefit Project Starfury.  If you have one, and
would like to let it go, we'll trade you either an official B5 crew cap,
or an autographed copy of our very first script for the B5 series,
"Midnight on the Firing Line."  If you're so inclined, drop me a note in
email and I'll get you the address.  Thanks.
