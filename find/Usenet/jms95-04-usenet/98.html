<H2>ATTN JMS: Kosh CGI Question</H2>
21 Apr 1995<PRE>     What we have in mind for Kosh is going to tax our capabilities to the
limit.  It will be a mix of prosthetics, CGI, compositing, wardrobe, an
unusual kind of matte, different exposure techniques, on and on and on;
the visual effects meeting on just this one sequence was the biggest one
we've ever had, drawing in every department (also practical effects,
visual effects, rotoscope, and others).  The sequence exists in lots of
different pieces which will take us months to assemble, so I haven't seen
the final product yet, but if we've done this right, it should be a real
doozy.
