24 Apr 1995<PRE>     Everything featured in the Babylon Emporium was just made up by us.
Insofar as I know, none of it is real merchandise.  (Everyone, including
the crew, are so starved for B5 stuff that when we finished filming the
ep, we sold off the stuff, at cost, to those in the crew who wanted them.
Two guesses who wound up with the Londo and G'Kar dolls....)
