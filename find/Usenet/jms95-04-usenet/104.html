<H2>ATTN JMS: "Watch it cold"</H2>
22 Apr 1995<PRE>     If there were three episodes I'd say should be watched as cold as
possible, I'd say..."In the Shadow of Z'ha'dum," "The Fall of Night,"
and "The Long, Twilight Struggle."  (To some extent, I'd also inclulde
[include] "Confessions and Lamentations," and "Divided Loyalties.")
 
     Unfortunately, that's the bulk of the remaining episodes, as opposed
to CoS, which was a one-off situation.  Hell, in some ways, when compared
with "Struggle," "The Coming of Shadows" is a light comedy in which nothing
much happens.
 
     Remember, the deeper we go into the story, the more we're going to
start cranking things.  Each new batch starts off with a lighter, "let's
get acquainted" episode, but they turn fast.  So I don't know what can
really be done about spoilers and stuff, except to hope for the best.
 
     "Confessions" isn't per se a wham episode, for instance, but it does
have some very sharp turns, and it's an extremely intense episode on a
par with "Believers."  It makes no compromises and takes no prisoners, and
I imagine it'll stir up about as much debate as did "Believers," if not
more.  When we did playback after doing the audio mix a few days ago,
there wasn't a dry eye in the house.
 
     So while it isn't a whammer, it's an *emotional* episode, and you
should come to it as unprepared as possible.
