<H2>Re: What's up with Babcom 95 ?</H2>
11 Apr 1995<PRE>     The problem, of course, is that fan cons usually operate very close
to the financial edge, because they're *not* about making money.  Which is
good on one level, on several actually...but the problem you run into is
when you then have to bring in guests from overseas.  Traveling from the
US to the UK costs a LOT of money, plus hotel, food, on and on.  Most of
the smaller fan-run cons can't afford to do that in general, or for only
one person; a profit con really represents the only chance most people will
ever have to see several people from a given show, though Wolf 359 is doing
a bit more in that area.
