20 Apr 1995<PRE>     Neil: on actors getting a piece of their merchandise...roll this one
around for a bit...the majority of ST actors (excluding Nimoy, Kelley and
Shatner) have each gotten, roughly, $16,000 as their share of profit
sharing/merchandising over the 25 years of ST history.  Ain't life funny?
