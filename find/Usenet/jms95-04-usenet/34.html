<H2>ATTN JMS: Re: Atheism (was "Ne</H2>
13 Apr 1995<PRE>     If I say to you, "Did you lock the car door when you parked it?" and
you say, "I believe so," is that a belief that is equal to, say, the
tenets of Judaism?  Is that equal to the theses Martin Luther nailed to
the church door?  Are you now a believer in Locked-Doorism?
 
     If you define any belief as reliion, then you diminish and
trivialize religion.  (Oops, typo above.)  Words mean what they mean, not
what we want them to mean when it is convenient for us.  The Oxford
American Dictionary defines religion as "belief in the existence of a
superhuman power, especially of gods or gods, usually expressed in
worship; a particular system of faith and worship."
 
     "Belief" is not the key word in the preceding sentence; it's the
phrase "belief IN the EXISTENCE of a superhuman power."  It's what the
belief is IN.  If it does not contain the belief IN the existence of a
superhuman power/god, then it is NOT religion.  Period.
 
     This is just one more offshoot of the whole (and boy, do I hate to
even mention this) evolution/creation thing, where schools said, "No, we
cannot teach creation, we teach science, not religion."  So the
creationists decided to come back with "Oh, but evolution IS a religion,
so why them and not us, huh?  Huh?"  It's an attempt to redefine terms
for advantage.
 
     Me, I stick with the Oxford Dictionary.
