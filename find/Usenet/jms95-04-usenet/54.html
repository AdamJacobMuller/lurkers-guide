<H2>Why B5 races are at the same l</H2>
16 Apr 1995<PRE>     Except, of course, they're *not* all at the same level.  The Minbari
are well ahead of Earth and the Centauri and the Narns; the Narns are
slightly ahead of Earth, and the Centauri are ahead of both; the Vorlons
and the Shadows are both head and shoulders above all the rest; the Drazi
are probably a bit less than Earth.
