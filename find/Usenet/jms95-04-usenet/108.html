<H2>ATTN JMS: SitW SD CGI??</H2>
23 Apr 1995<PRE>     The San Diego shots are models.  We're trying, in different episodes,
models vs. CGI.  Next season, PTEN willing, we're going to try some new
stuff in planetary models interlocked with CGI for cities and stuff, to
help us further broaden out the series.
