<H2>B5 MicroMachine news (maybe)</H2>
12 Apr 1995<PRE>     The MicroMachines *are* out, they *have* been purchased, and more are
being commissioned.  (Several new prototypes came through my office for
approval last week, including a Narn heavy cruiser and Earthforce 1.)  I
can only conclude that some dealers, who didn't know or think to orde
them, are saying they're not coming out just to cover their own butts.
