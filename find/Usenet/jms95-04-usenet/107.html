23 Apr 1995<PRE>     For track 12, Christopher did a much longer, full-length version of
The Battle of the Line sequence, adding a lot of depth and letting it play
out fully.  So yes, parts of it echo what's on the disk earlier, but in a
better, extended-play version.  For me, it's one of the best tracks on the
disk (though I somewhat prefer the American version over the European
version, due to the strings).
