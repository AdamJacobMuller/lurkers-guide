<H2>ATTN: JMS INCOME=DEBTS?</H2>
21 Apr 1995<PRE>     I do not hold the copyright for B5.  The copyright for ALL shows is
in the hands of the studios.  Roddenberry, for instance, did not own (and
his estate does not own) Star Trek.  Paramount does.  Look at any of the
ST merchandise: (c) (year) Paramount Television.  Warner Bros./PTEN holds
the copyright for B5.
 
     Thus, if they license it to a comics company, it's between the company
and the "creator" for legal purposes...Warner Bros.  Ditto for the novels.
Why do I thus get involved anyway?  Because they're based on my show, and
I have a personal interest in making sure they're done right.
 
     And as stated, the goal is to keep income below debits *on paper*,
not in reality.
 
     Because all studios know that if they can show no net income, they
never have to pay profit participation.
 
                                                                     jms
