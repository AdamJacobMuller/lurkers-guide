<H2>Re: B5 CD</H2>
20 Apr 1995<PRE>     Actually, to correct this, the last track in the European version
has more *perussion* and fewer strings, whereas the American version has
more strings and less percussion (this in the longer, reorchestrated
suite of the Requiem for the Line).  This was because Chris sent me the
tape with the last track for my approval.  I listened to it, and thought
it was great...but for me, what really makes the RftL theme so beautiful
and moving and tragic and powerful are the strings in counterpoint to the
rest of the rhythm.  Here they were missing.  So I called, and said, "It
really needs the strings."  By this point they were already pressing the
European edition, and it was too late to do anything about it.  It was
subsequently revised for the American release.  So now there are two
versions floating around out there; the percussive version is nice for
the driving aspect of it, it hits you hard in the gut; the string version
hits you in the heart and breaks it.
