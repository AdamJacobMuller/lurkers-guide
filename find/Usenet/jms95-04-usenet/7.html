<H2>Attn: JMS - "Only decent SF on</H2>
3 Apr 1995<PRE>     I slipped the reference to B5 into OtherSyde to see if it would become
a self-fulfilling prophecy or just a fictional reference.  Just for fun.
 
     My books are out of print because I guess I haven't actively pursued
keeping them IN print.  When I finish my next novel, I'll probably be able
to get them back into print, but that won't be until B5 is done, since the
next book -- a contemporary dark fantasy -- is targeted at about 1,000
manuscript pages, and I won't really be able to get into it until then.
 
                                                                  jms
