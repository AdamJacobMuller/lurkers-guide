<H2>Re: JMS: Why no action figures</H2>
26 Apr 1995<PRE>     Captain Power was, certainly, an extreme case, and yes, I walked off
that show after the first season because I felt the merchandising was
starting to drive the show, and determine where the stories were going to
go.  That won't happen on this show because I won't *let* it.  If that
makes me a little leery on this stuff...well, that's better than being too
eager, I suppose.
