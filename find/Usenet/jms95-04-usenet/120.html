<H2>JMS: Cheers and boos on the la</H2>
24 Apr 1995<PRE>     "I presume they are selling Londo dolls and the ones used in the show
were samples."
 
     Nope.  There are no Londo dolls.  No G'Kar dolls.  No dolls of any
kind.  No B5 clocks or starfuries (minus the MicroMachines) or frisbees or
postcards or the like.  There's *very* little out there.
 
     Which is how we like it.
