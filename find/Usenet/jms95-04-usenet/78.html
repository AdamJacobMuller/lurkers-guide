<H2>ATTN JMS: Life expectancy</H2>
20 Apr 1995<PRE>     In "Soul Hunter," Franklin notes that the average human life span is
now about a hundred years.  It's quite a bit longer for the other races;
G'Kar is about 70 or more, but is considered mid-range, equal to a human
in early 40s, among Narns.  Delenn is in about the same position, equal to
30s-40s in her terms, but in years a bit older.  They are a pretty long
lived people.  Centauri aren't quite as long-lived, but they do a bit
better than the Narns.  The Vorlons......are.
