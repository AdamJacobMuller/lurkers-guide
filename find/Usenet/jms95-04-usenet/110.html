23 Apr 1995<PRE>     Yeah, maybe it wasn't a direct shot this time, but you have to
understand how Theron works.  It works something like this....
 
     T: "That's a nice haircut."
 
     S: "Thank you."
 
     "It shows your profile to best effect."
 
     "Thank you."
 
     "Good sculpting on the back."
 
     "Umm, hmm."
 
     "So overall, it's a very nice haircut."
 
     "Thank you."
 
     "Well, for an axe murderer...."
 
     After a while, y'know...why wait?
