14 Apr 1995<PRE>     "Religion is the belief ABOUT the existence of a superhuman power."
 (As opposed to IN the existence of a superhuman power.)
 
     No, it's not.  By your definition, if I'm a Protestant, and I don't
believe in Thor, by virtue of that belief about Thor, now I'm a beliegver
(believer) in Norse mythology.  That's simply silly.
 
     There is a difference between saying, "I believe there is no god,"
and "I do not have within me the belief in the existence of a god."  The
latter is not a belief in, or about, any kind of power; it is the total
absence of belief.  You cannot turn that into a religion, no matter how
many times you repeat your thesis.
