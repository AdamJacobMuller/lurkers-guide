<H2>JMS: "And Now For a Word" Infl</H2>
20 Apr 1995<PRE>     Where it came from, in part, was oddly enough, a theatrical
exercise.
 
     There's a thing you do in theater training where you're told to talk
about a subject, never use the word "I" ...but in the end wind up telling
us more about *you* than the subject you're speaking about.  So I began
to wonder if I could apply this exercise, in a limited way, to an episode
of the show.  I can't say more than that without spoiling things, but
suffice to say you learn a lot about all kinds of people, and the way you
learn it says a lot about those involved.  It's a *very* subversive and
tricky episode, and I *very* much suggest taping it, so you can go back
and check something out later.  You'll know what.  If you don't, you'll
kick yourself later.
