<H2>ATTN JMS: How Much Surround?</H2>
6 Apr 1995<PRE>     The amount of surround that goes into a show depends on the nature
of the show.  For instance, there was some very good use of surround in
"A Race Through Dark Places," "And the Sky Full of Stars," "Mind War"
and "The Long Dark."  If it's just a casual Zocalo scene, there ain't
much you can do with it.
