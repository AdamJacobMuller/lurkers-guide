<H2>JMS: What would you have done</H2>
20 Apr 1995<PRE>     If we'd only had models to work with, then we would've found some way
to make the models work.  I think a lot of the difficulty with TV EFX is
just not thinking things through, and doing everything last-minute.  We
don't generally have that problem.
 
     One of the options we discussed at the time was shooting model EFX
sequences in a slightly different way.  Because I know the story for each
year ahead of time, we could've ganged all the EFX shots together.  I.e.,
you know you're going to have battle scenes in episodes 3 and 7 between
the same two races, same kinds of ships.  So you double up your cameras
for different angles, and basically shoot both at once, then isolate the
different pieces for either of the two episodes.  We also would've had a
second unit shooting 2 days per week as a visual EFX unit.
 
     Either way, it would've been done.  We're quite happy that CGI came
along when it did, but we would've found some way to do it regardless.
The history of this series is that of determination despite whatever
obstacles are thrown at us.  Once we set our minds to the course, nothing
stops us.
 
     Patience, determination, direction and strength.
