<H2>ATTN JMS: Kosh CGI Question</H2>
21 Apr 1995<PRE>     PS...as an aside on EFX...we constantly slip EFX in and a lot of
folks don't even notice it, because we don't point to it or make a big
deal out of it.  It's just *there*.  One example of this I mentioned was
the sanctuary in "Coming of Shadows," a virtual set that doesn't exist
in reality.
 
     Here's another one.
 
     In "Soul Mates," and in the main title, you'll see the shot of the
bazaar.  It's a wide shot, showing the two levels of the bazaar, with
people walking on either side of the second floor, looking down into the
main area.
 
     Secret revealed: there IS no second floor.  Doesn't exist.  We made
the second level digitally.  To the best of my knowledge (though I might
have missed something), I don't think anyone noticed this as being a CGI/
composite effect.  It's just there.
 
                                                                   jms
