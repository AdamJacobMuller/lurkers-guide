<H2>ATTN JMS:Does Sheridan wear al</H2>
18 Apr 1995<PRE>      Yes, Sheridan wears all his medals (absent those too big or showy for
chest-display).  As for Andreas, we're putting him up for an Emmy for his
work (also other cast members), and can only hope the Academy recognizes
the fine work he's done.  Beyond that, there's nothing the fans can do but
hope....
