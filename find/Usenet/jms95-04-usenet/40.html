14 Apr 1995<PRE>     Sorry, Kristin, I won't be put into your box.  You say some
comparative religion studies include Dianetics.  A professor can choose
to include or exclude anything he or she wants.  What's it to me?  And
yes, parts of Shinto don't involve god, but parts do.
 
     Most significantly, howver, ALL the examples you cite to me DO
believe in a superhuman power...specifically, a soul, which is reborn in
one way or another in all the beliefs you named.  So the definition still
applies.
