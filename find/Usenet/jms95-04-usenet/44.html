<H2>ATTN JMS: Link question</H2>
15 Apr 1995<PRE>     The Links are individually coded; when someone says, "Garibaldi to
Sheridan," the Link system (tied into the B5 central computer, which can
also provide research and other data) dials up the code for Sheridan's
link, and breeps.  The transmitters are *very* powerful, and are usually
boosted by systems inside B5.  If a Link were stolen, it could be
detected instantly upon being used.
