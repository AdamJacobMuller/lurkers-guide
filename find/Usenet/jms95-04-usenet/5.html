<H2>JMS: UK C4 ratings</H2>
3 Apr 1995<PRE>     Yeah, I'd love to see the C4 ratings; if you think it'd be better
email, that's fine, or public, either way.  I understand we're doing VERY
well at C4, one of their higher-rated American shows, but I haven't been
given the hard-and-crunchies by WB International.
