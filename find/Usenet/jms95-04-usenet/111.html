<H2>ATTN JMS: Pak'Ma'Ra ! RA! RA!</H2>
23 Apr 1995<PRE>     The pak'ma'ra are indeed tech scavengers; the tentacles move (we do
this via remote control), and are used in securing their food and moving
it into the mouth cavity; their "teeth" are more like beaks in structure;
their whole culture is based on the notion that they're basically
superior to everyone else, which is why they eat carrion in part, to
demonstrate their superiority over all others (they don't eat their own
kind); they do breathe oxygen, but because of the shape of their mouths,
cannot form human words, and thus rely on translation devices.
