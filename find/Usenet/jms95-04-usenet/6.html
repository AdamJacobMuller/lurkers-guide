<H2>ATTN JMS: Point about bloopers</H2>
3 Apr 1995<PRE>     Bloopers still use the likenesses of the actors, ARE the actors, shot
on our sets, using our costumes...one can't take that and sell it around
town without giving something back to the actors, I think.  If we should
end up ever selling the blooper, or scripts, we would find some formula to
give back to those involved.
 
     I'd expect to hear more on the CD Rom after the 3rd year pickup.
 
     Valen willing.
