<H2>JMS in the UK this weekend</H2>
27 Apr 1995<PRE>     For those in the UK, Claudia Christian, Peter Jurasik and I will be
swooping in for Babcom 95, held this weekend (the 29th and 30th) in
Birmingham at the National Exhibition Center.  This will be a more fan
friendly convention than is usually the case at event-style conventions.
 
     We hear tickets are going fast, so if you're doing to go, best to
look into it.
