<H2>JMS: Why no action figures?</H2>
24 Apr 1995<PRE>     I'm not *entirely* opposed to the idea of action figures, but let's
a) do that a bit down the road, and b) make sure it's done *right*.  The
last thing anyone wants is for this stuff to look crummy.  So while we've
had some inquiries, my sense is to wait for the right time and company,
rather than just rush out and do this stuff.
