<H2>ATTN JMS: Significance of "twi</H2>
23 Apr 1995<PRE>     Yes; work it out as you have, but take it further...we start with a
point of departure...then after some revelations, examine the geometry of
shadows, then begin to more forward, a race through dark plces.  We come
toward the long dark, our past a distant star.  We carry the motif of a
world getting dark.  The coming of shadows that darkens into the long
twilight struggle, the last period between day and night...and we end the
season on...the fall of night.
