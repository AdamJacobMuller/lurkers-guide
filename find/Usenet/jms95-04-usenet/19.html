<H2>B5-Micromachines observation</H2>
8 Apr 1995<PRE>      As it happens, I just had some new prototypes of MicroMacs from B5
come through my office for approval.  Some nifty stuff, including the
atmospheric shuttle, a Narn heavy cruiser, the awful purple Centauri
liner, and the President's Earthforce One, which is REALLY nifty....
