<H2>&gt; Attn: JMS - Who is Douglas N</H2>
8 Apr 1995<PRE>     Doug Netter is my business partner in Babylon 5, and co-owner of
Babylonian Productions, along with me.  A lot of what he does is the
behind the scenes business stuff, sometimes liaisoning (?) with Warner
Bros. on those conversations when it's considered too dangerous to let
me talk to them directly, and sitting in on casting, that sort of thing.
A lot of what he does is mollifying execs when I make them nuts; he tends
to get a lot of phone calls that begin with, "Do you KNOW what he's done
NOW?"
