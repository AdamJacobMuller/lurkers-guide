<H2>ATTN: JMS BIG BANG CON!</H2>
20 Apr 1995<PRE>     Some of our cast members have decided to risk what all believe is a
potentially troublesome situation and go to Big Bang, despite the problems
we've had with them, because it was learned subsequent to the initial
decision not to take part in it that many folks had bought non-refundable
airline tickets, and may not get ticket refunds.  They're determined not
to see the fans burned by this.  Babylonian Productions, Warners nor I can
endorse or support the con in any way; we've been burned enough.  Thus I
can't go.  But I must commend our cast for rising above the problems
presented to us at the other end, and risking more problems by taking part.
 
     For their sake, and the fans, it is my hope that this somehow comes
out okay.  Suffice to say we're going to be watching *very* carefully.
