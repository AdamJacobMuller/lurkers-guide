<H2>JMS: What does it take?</H2>
18 Apr 1995<PRE>     A lot of notes are amusing, or interesting, but don't seem to
require a direct response.  I have to be fairly stringent in determining
the extent of replying, or I'd be doing nothing else.  Basically, if a
thread seems to meander after a while, I'll generally bail out after a
few days.
