<H2>favorite scene so far...</H2>
6 Apr 1995<PRE>     Re: the shadow vessels flying overhead as Londo looks up...that was
me.  If my name's on a script, and you see something there as a story
point, it was in the script.
 
     That particular image is very striking, and I think part of that comes
from its origins: I've had dreams with just that sort of image.  There's
something that just *gets* to you on a very subconscious, almost cellular
level, when you see that scene...I don't know why, but it does.
