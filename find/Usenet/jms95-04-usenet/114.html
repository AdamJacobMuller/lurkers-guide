<H2>Attn JMS: Minbari Questions</H2>
23 Apr 1995<PRE>     The Minbari do have magneto-gravitational control in limited ways.
The ships are mainly cool shapes they came up with, in line with their
particular aesthetic.  The Minbari mainly dislike Sheridan for HOW he won
his battle, as well as for the fact that he did it at all.  You'll get
more on this in the next ep.
