<H2>ATTN JMS: Re: So JMS won't spe</H2>
18 Apr 1995<PRE>     Yes, what I said was what I intended.  Do the studios profit from
their series/movies?  Of course.  But many of the contracts with their
people -- actors, writers, producers, directors -- stipulate that they get
a piece of any net profit.  Consequently, the studios do all they can to
make sure that *on paper* it looks as if they've never had a profit.
 
     There have been many cases of stars who, twenty years after their
shows entered syndication, asked where the heck their profit is, and were
told that the show is still in the red.  Does anyone believe this?  Of
course not.  But getting into their books for audits is hard; ask Art
Buchwald.
