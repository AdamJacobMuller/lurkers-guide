<H2>Big Bang: ATTN JMS</H2>
13 Apr 1995<PRE>     Faramarz: after I went to Chicago to check out how the con was going
to be run (before this we only had what we'd been told over the phone), I
came away with the terrible belief that this convention was not going to
be run properly, was incapable of being fixed (after providing several
chances for the organizers to show they could do so), and had to make a
hard decision: back away, or endorse a convention that I don't believe in,
which I believed was systemically flawed, and the hell with the fans who
get burned.  It's a crummy decision to have to make, and I didn't like
having to make it.  But there *is* no middle ground on this.
 
     If you want to book passage on the Titanic, and I keep suggesting
that maybe that might not be a good idea...am I being unfair to the
passengers?
