<H2>Shelved/Unused scripts</H2>
18 Apr 1995<PRE>     Insofar as I can recall, there are no unusued *scripts*.  There were
a few abandoned outlines, and some stories that I wanted to get around to
writing, which I decided to shelve for one reason or another long before
they were written down in any form.
