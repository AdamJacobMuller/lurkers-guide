<H2>ATTN JMS: Speculation vs Story</H2>
13 Apr 1995<PRE>     I didn't read much of that thread (since I already know who jms is
going to kill next), but nothing of what I saw crossed any lines into
story ideas.  It's when new scenarios are painted in detail ("And then
Sheridan met the great cosmic space moose, who gave him the Golden Wazoo
of the Minbari, which was actually the alien healing device with a
mustache")...that any trouble emerges.
