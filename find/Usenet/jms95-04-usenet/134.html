<H2>Re: Thaxton's Return</H2>
26 Apr 1995<PRE>     1) There is no requirement to the stations that they take B5 to get
Kung Fu.  This is, quite simply, a lie.
 
     2) I have posted the ratings before.  They have continued to grow
during new episodes, and fall back during reruns, as do all shows.  The
statement that the ratings are going down is, quite simply, a lie.
 
     But that's what Ford does.
 
     So what else is new?
