<H2>ATTN JMS: Question about "Accu</H2>
15 Apr 1995<PRE>     The books are canon in broad terms, in that the events generally did
happen, but the details can vary given that you've got diverse hands doing
the work (including the comics).  I try to work with them both in as much
detail as I can...I read the novel manuscripts preperatory to being
typeset, and same for the comics, making suggestions and changes as
necessary.  (In one comic issue I added a change to one panel that should
send some shockwaves out here and there...just two words that might raise
some neck-hairs.)
