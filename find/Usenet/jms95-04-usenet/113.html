     Actually, that picture is of Horatio P. Farquar, an explorer who was
lost while pursuing stories of the Yeti far in the Himalayan mountains,
and whose picture I used shamelessly for my own purposes.  In truth, I am
two-headed (the other one only goes by the name Bob) and am frequently
trotted out for the annual Cat Frightening Festival in La Mesa.
