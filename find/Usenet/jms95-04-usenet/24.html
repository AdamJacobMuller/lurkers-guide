<H2>Ship designs reflect on '2010'</H2>
11 Apr 1995<PRE>     The ships on 2010 and Babylon 5 operate out of the necessity of
traveling without standard SF artificial gravity.  These designs have been
discussed among scientists (in general) for ages; so there's no intention
to be close to 2010, but when both are based upon the same scientific
principles, there will be echoes.  Form follows function.
