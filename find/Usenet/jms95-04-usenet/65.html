<H2>Ivanova's sex scene</H2>
18 Apr 1995<PRE>     Judelon: bingo.  When I scripted that scene, that's exactly what was
intended; it goes from the pickup line "come here often?  yes, I do" to
"dinner, drinks, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss GRAB!" then asking how
it is for the other person, then "I slept with you the other night, you
didn't call, you didn't write, I think you do it just for spite!"
 
     In a way, the way it's written, it IS sex human style, in that it has
all the elements in, say, about 30 seconds (which is also about right in
some cases).  From meeting through bed to breakup....
