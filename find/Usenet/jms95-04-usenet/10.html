<H2>What's up with Mojo???</H2>
6 Apr 1995<PRE>     The Lightwave software is being exported to DOS platforms, so that's
the reason for the change-over.
 
     BTW, Ron's gotten in some *very* nifty new software, and has come
up with some new tricks that I hope we can incorporate before the end of
this season, all again blurring the line between physical models, CGI and
Real Stuff.
