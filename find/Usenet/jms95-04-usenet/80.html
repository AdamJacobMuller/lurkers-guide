20 Apr 1995<PRE>     Kevin: I'm paid a salary per episode produced, a creator's royalty
of a few hundred bucks per ep, and the script fee for any script I write.
By conventional standards, as compared to truly worthwhile jobs, like
teaching, it's a good chunk of change; compared to what you get on a
network show, it's basically chump-change.  But I ain't really in this
to make a gazillion bucks; I want to tell this story.
