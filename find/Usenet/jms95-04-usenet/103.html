<H2>regarding Babylon 5's ratings</H2>
21 Apr 1995<PRE>     Bear in mind you're comparing apples and oranges.  The top 20 shows
in syndication include mainly game shows and talk shows.  You have to do
what the studios do, and separate out the dramas from the rest of the
pack.  And among dramas we do *very* well, particularly in our
demographics.
