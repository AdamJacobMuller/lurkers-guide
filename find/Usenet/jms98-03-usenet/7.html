&gt;How did you (or do you) approach a regular on the show and tell them
&gt;that you want them to do a really intense scene the likes that has not
&gt;been done on the show before (ie Byron/Lyta)?  I had only seen stuff
&gt;like that on NYPD Blue, but people on that show know what they are
&gt;getting into.  Just curious.

I talked to both actors involved, made sure they were okay with it, and then
scripted it out in very detailed form, and shot with a closed set, just
necessary crew, nobody else.  

(Funny item: in the script, I'm right in the middle of describing the sex
scene, and in the narrative description, I write, without even thinking about
it, "I wonder which is more embarrassing, reading this or writing it?"  It goes
out that way.)
