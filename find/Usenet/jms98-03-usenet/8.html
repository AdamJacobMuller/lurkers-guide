6 Mar 1998<PRE>We suggested moving up DotD because the NBA playoffs will hit after #12, and
better to have 3-4 intense episodes in a row, culminating in 12, than to break
up the middle, which would've been okay as a respite if there wasn't going to
be a break, but since there is a break now, I want to slam the last few before
it hits for more impact.
