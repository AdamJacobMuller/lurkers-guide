&gt;What's left is everyone (the member races, the
&gt;Centauri, the Narn, the telepaths) trying to work out who's lying, who's
&gt;breaking the rules, and what to do about it.  Basically, group dynamics.  No
&gt;great enemies.  No ancient forces.  Just people.

After any big war, that's the big battle that still awaits...how do we work out
living together?  Do we fall apart, or stay together?  Wars of revolution have
traditionally been followed by civil wars because the new dynamics are changing
and people take a while to adjust.  And this show has always been about
process: before, during and after.
