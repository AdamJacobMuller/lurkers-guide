<H2>Re: We're Missing out on some of the Arc!</H2>
18 Mar 1998<PRE>&gt;But out of the first 8 episodes in season 5, only
&gt;two were arc episodes. 

That's an assumption; it's not a correct one.  

&gt;That means that the
&gt;greatest number of arc episodes season 5 can
&gt;have is 16. From the plot summaries, it seems
&gt;that there are two or three more non-arc
&gt;episodes later this season, so this makes 13-14
&gt;arc episodes for season 5.

No, there's now only one stand-alone left in the balance of S5.  And, again,
you've got arc material in the first batch, whether you choose to recognize it
now or not.

&gt;So the total number of
&gt;arc episodes in the series will only be 56 or so.
&gt;We'll be missing out on 5-8 episodes, which is
&gt;a good 10% of the arc.
&gt;
&gt;So what happened? Where do you think the
&gt;material was cut from?

Nowhere.  You can't apply math to a creative situation, and in an ongoing
process solidify everything so much in stone in season 1 that you can't adjust.
 

It's going where it was meant to go.
