3 Mar 1998<PRE>&gt;Do you believe in telepathy and other such talents?

I think there are certain non-supernatural phenomenon that are currently beyond
adequate description, but which can sometimes be observed and will one day be
classified...a lot of it to do with synchronicity....

But if you ask me point blank, do I believe in mind readers...no.
