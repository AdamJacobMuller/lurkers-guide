<H2>Re: Attn JMS:  Witness for the Defense?</H2>
10 Mar 1998<PRE>&gt; Oftentimes when people criticize the show, or a character or
&gt;whatever, you rise to its defense.  I could understand you answering
&gt;questions people have about different aspects of the story - that helps
&gt;us all.  But rebutting people who don't like X or Y or whatever?
&gt;
&gt;Your work is your work.  There is no need to defend it or its quality.
&gt;
&gt;So, why do you do this?
&gt;
Usually, I don't...if someone doesn't like something, he doesn't like
something, that's fine and to be expected.  It's when someone deliberately
distorts something that I tend to get into it.

Why?

Because I'm an idiot, that's why.
