22 Mar 1998<PRE>&gt;How intense were your feelings that day? At the chat room we were being
&gt;informed of what went on over there, but how much more things were in
&gt;your head?

Everything...all of them...every possible emotion was going through me from one
second to the next.  People were in tears.  It was hard.
