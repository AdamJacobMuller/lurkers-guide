<H2>Re: Budgets for Season 5</H2>
18 Mar 1998<PRE>&gt;With the move to TNT, one assumes that dollars spent per episode have
&gt;shrunk.  Is it just me, or do the shows seem to have a lot less CGI in
&gt;them this season?

Yes and no and yes....

Someone online did a recent breakdown, and actually the amount of CGI in the
first batch of S5 episodes is slightly higher than S4, and S4 is slightly
higher than S3 at that same point.

But that said...I did keep the first batch just a *bit* on the light side in
order to have room to do the massive amount of rendering on "In the Beginning"
and "Thirdspace," the latter of which has (finally delivered) topped out at 27
minutes of CGI out of 94 minutes, which has got to be some kind of record.

And *that* said...each season we have increased the amount of CGI we've done,
both in the amount and the complexity of the shots, and this season is no
exception.  We're trying some new things, different kinds of CGI...you'll see
some of that in "The Ragged Edge," for instance.  Much more sophisticated
compositing, more difficult to shoot, but more visually interesting.
