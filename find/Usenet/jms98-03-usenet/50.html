<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Music recommendation</H2>
26 Mar 1998<PRE>I've got all three of the CDs by Cherry Poppin' Daddies, and I think two of the
three are terrific; the third (earlier) CD is kinda generic, I think they were
still trying to find their sound.

Zoot Suit Daddy is a nifty song, and it's impossible to listen to their current
album and remain sad about anything.  I love that they mix a swing/big band
sound with contemporary (and sometimes raw or edgy) lyrics.  They're just
terrific.
