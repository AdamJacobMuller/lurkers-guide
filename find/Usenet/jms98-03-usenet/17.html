<H2>Re: ATTN: JMS - Day of the Dead **Spoilers**</H2>
12 Mar 1998<PRE>&gt;My question is that as much as people
&gt;who follow a particular religion might have a crisis of faith, do
&gt;atheist ever have the same crisis where they self examine what they
&gt;believe?  Not that you would change what you would believe, but the
&gt;characters in the series constantly show the signs of self doubt.

I think you *have* to question what you believe (or don't believe, or believe
you believe or believe what you don't believe) on a regular basis, the way you
exercise any muscle.  If you leave it unattended, it gets flabby and soft and
intellectually lazy.  The peril of the unexamined life is one of the things
I've often railed about in one place or another...whether or not you come back
to your original position after a lengthy self-examination, the important thing
is that you *do* it from time to time, honestly and straightforwardly, because
you could change your position, or if you don't, at least you now have more
reasons and a better understanding of it, so that you can defend it and talk
about it rationally rather than get angry because you can't articulate why you
believe what you believe.

And I believe that may be one of the longest unbroken sentences I've yet
written....
