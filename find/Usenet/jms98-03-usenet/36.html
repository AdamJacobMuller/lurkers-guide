<H2>Re: ATTN JMS:  What now?</H2>
22 Mar 1998<PRE>&gt;In terms of what's still to be done on B5, how much is done at the
&gt;studios?  Will there still be people there for some time to come,
&gt;considering that you'll be doing the movies?

Basically, everyone's around but the camera crew...we have to do construction
and other work for the movies, so I'd say we're at 80% normal for the next 10
days, until filming on the next movie starts on the 30th.
