26 Mar 1998<PRE>I hope you're right.  I've long classified B5 not as a *moral* show, because I
don't have any morals to give anyone, but rather as an *ethical* show, posing
questions and bringing up issues as honestly as I can, to let the viewers
discuss the implications and come to decisions on their own.  If we have
succeeded in doing that, then I'm happy.
