<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Just watched SOtS</H2>
9 Mar 1998<PRE>Thanks..for all of that.  

And yeah, once this season is over, my presence on the nets will substantially
diminish...but it's been a great experience, for the most part, occasional
nutcases and bozos notwithstanding.  In the last year, I think more could've
been done in this ongoing conversation about educating people on the nature of
making TV, which was one of the reasons for doing this...but in many ways I'm
limited by the quality of the questions asked, and lately it's been more
posting of reactions (good and bad, that isn't meant to be a critical comment)
than questions related to who/how/why/what.

Right now, we're shooting 521...three more weeks total, and the Babylon 5
series is over.  Seems vaguely hard to believe.
