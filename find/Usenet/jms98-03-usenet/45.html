25 Mar 1998<PRE>&gt; I am about to graduate with a Ph.D. in sociology from the
&gt;University of Kansas, and I am curious to know where you studied
&gt;sociology. Excellent show!

Thanks.

I got my first BA in Clinical Psychology (with a minor in Philosophy) and my
second BA in Sociology (with a minor in Literature) from San Diego State
University.
