9 Mar 1998<PRE>&gt;It seems to me that things are not progressing (plotwise) as quickly as
&gt;they have in previous seasons.

Folks have repeatedly said that in the first season, they weren't aware there
WAS an arc until episode 16, "Signs and Portents."  Then, later, they would
look back and see all the setups going on.

That will be much the same situation here.
