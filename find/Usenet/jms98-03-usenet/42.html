<H2>Re: Attn JMS: What makes you laugh?</H2>
25 Mar 1998<PRE>I like humor that surprises me...unexpected twists and turns of logic on the
one hand, and just in-your-face screaming out loud humor on the other hand. 
George Carlin is a favorite.  For reasons I do not fully understand, Buddy
Hackett (of all people) leaves me absolutely breathless and on the floor.  Sam
Kinneson had a much similar effect.  Dennis Miller's black-and-white HBO
half-hour destroyed me; utterly hysterical.
