25 Mar 1998<PRE>Because we have only $3 million on which to make these movies, we have to
rotate the cast because we can't afford to have them all in any one of them. 
Bruce and Mira were in the first two, so we gave Tracy a shot and put in Jerry
as well as Corwin (his first), Zack and Franklin.

We're just looking for ways to be fair to the maximum number of cast with the
resources we have.
