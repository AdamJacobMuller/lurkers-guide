<H2>Re: ATTN JMS : C&amp;C Gravity</H2>
18 Mar 1998<PRE>&gt;#I'm just curious about how C&amp;C has normal gravity when it is located in
&gt;the center of the spinning station. In the fall of Night (And other
&gt;episodes) it is established that the middle of the station is low grav.

It isn't.  The center is the docking bay.  C&amp;C is one-third of the way below
that, so it has about 1/3rd gravity, so a 200 pound person weigs 66 pounds, not
likely to go floating around.
