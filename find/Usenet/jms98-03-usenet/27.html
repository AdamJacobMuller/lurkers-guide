<H2>new jms short story out</H2>
18 Mar 1998<PRE>So Harlan says, "Only *you* could find having a new short story published to be
as important as doing a multi-million buck TV series."  Okay, so it's true.

I recently finished a new short story (almost novelette length), "We Killed
Them In the Ratings," which has just been published in a new collection edited
by Martin Greenberg, Blowout in Little Man Flats, a mystery anthology featuring
a lot of Big Name folks.  It's kind of a fun (if dark) story about a local TV
news program that comes up with a new approach to covering murder stories.
