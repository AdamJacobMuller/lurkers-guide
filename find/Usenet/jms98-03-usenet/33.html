20 Mar 1998<PRE>&gt;While watching 'Gallery', my wife and I couldn't help but compare Mack
&gt;and Bo to the gravediggers in Hamlet.  Was that your intention,
&gt;especially in light of Byron's quote from the same act?

It did come to mind at various points, but I didn't want to make it an homage
to anything.

&gt; WGA rules prohibit a producer from soliciting anything written
&gt;from a freelancer (without paying for it) and so the oral pitch
&gt;evolved.  But I got the impression that in some cases it was acceptable
&gt;for a freelancer to prepare written treatments in lieu of a pitch if the
&gt;writer so decides and the producer agrees.

Yes, some writers hate to pitch, and prefer to leave pages (called, most
creatively "leave behinds"), which also eliminates the need to rely on the
story editor to properly convey your story to the producer.

&gt;directors can
&gt;take offense when the narrative part of the script is too detailed
&gt;because it takes away from their ability to tell the story the way that
&gt;they see it.  I got the impression that you feel that one should have
&gt;enough of a narrative to tell the story and then it's up to the
&gt;director's discretion on whether to use the narrative instructions.

Screw 'em.  Write it the way you see it.  If they don't like it, they can black
it out; if it scares them that badly that they will fall apart, they shouldn't
be directing.
