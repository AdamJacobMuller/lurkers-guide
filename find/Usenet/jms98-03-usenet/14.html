<H2>Re: ATTN.: JMS - Writing Process</H2>
11 Mar 1998<PRE>&gt;When writing the scripts for B5 (or any other show), do you "see" the
&gt;script in novel format or in teleplay format in your mind?

Neither.  I see the scene itself, as if watching a movie.  I play it over and
over...initially, it's kind of out of focus, and incomplete, I have some
pieces, not others...the more times I play it back in my head, the more it
gradually comes into focus, and the missing pieces begin ot fill in...until I
see the whole scene, end to end, in perfect focus.  Then I use whatever form
I'm writing in -- a novel or a script -- and write it in that format.
