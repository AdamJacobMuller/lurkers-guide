&gt;Why didn't JMS bring Ivanova back to B5 to be visited by Marcus Cole, her
&gt;brother, or her father?
&gt;
&gt;Why didn't JMS put Sheridan in the zone to be visited by Kosh or Anne
&gt;Sheridan?

I didn't write it.  It's Neil's script.  The characters he chose are the ones
he wanted to play with.
