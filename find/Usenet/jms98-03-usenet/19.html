<H2>Re: ATTN: JMS Reduced Net Presence</H2>
14 Mar 1998<PRE>&gt;You've mentioned that after B5, your net presence will be substantially
&gt;reduced, which I can certainly understand. But I'm curious--do you also
&gt;anticipate reading less on the net? As far as I can see, you now read
&gt;virtually every posting in several forums. Will you in future be more
&gt;like the rest of us, who only pick out the threads that interest them?
&gt;
&gt;
Yes; the only other option is to go mad after a while.

&gt;I guess what I'm trying
&gt;to say is that the sense of wonder I felt then at the idea that a show's
&gt;creator would actually interact with fans in this way has never left me.
&gt;Thank you so very much for not only creating a great TV show, but for
&gt;sharing your thoughts with us.

All things considered, it's been a pleasure.
