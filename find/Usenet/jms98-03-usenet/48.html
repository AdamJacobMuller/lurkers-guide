<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Season Intros</H2>
26 Mar 1998<PRE>&gt;I was wondering when or perhaps what gave you the idea to
&gt;make each seasons intro different. Is this something you had planed from
&gt;the beginning or something the you came up with later.

No, it was something I wanted to do from the git-go, even though it's costly to
redesign the title sequence and music every season.  Each season is one volume
in the overall story, and my theory is that in a trilogy, for instance, you
have a different cover on each book that sets the tone for that particular
volume.  If B5 is such a work, then it should have a similar to each season's
"cover."
