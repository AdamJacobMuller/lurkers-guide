<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Last Days Saying Goodbye</H2>
18 Mar 1998<PRE>&gt;have you ever had the desire to continue the stories
&gt;of the surviving characters in the years leading up to Sleeping In The
&gt;Light.  Either through novels or comics or even CD-ROM multimedia?

The planned novels are going to expand on the arc, getting into the history of
the Psi Corps and Bester, the Technomages, and Centauri Prime.  Filling in the
corners of what's established.

&gt;Do you want (or not want) to leave the world of B5?  Yes, I know
&gt;the story is almost over and there will be a new series, but it won't be
&gt;the same.  Not better or worse, just not the same. 

Yes and no.  Make no mistake: this has been a burden, the heaviest one I've
ever carried, and it's come close to ruining my health on more than one
occasion.  I'll be glad to set it down....

But it's going to be hard to set it down.  As you say, whatever follows, it
won't be the same.  Everyone on set is feeling it right now.  

It's just...it's just real hard, that's all.
