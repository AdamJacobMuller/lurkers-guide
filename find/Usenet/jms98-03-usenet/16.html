11 Mar 1998<PRE>&gt;When fans send you snail-mail, do you delegate someone else to read it, or
&gt;do you read it yourself?    How should it be addressed?
&gt;
&gt;
No, nobody else answers my mail but me...however, remember that private email
is only to be used for personal matters or confidential matters that can't be
discussed elsewhere.  That won't change even after my online participation
falls back a bit.
