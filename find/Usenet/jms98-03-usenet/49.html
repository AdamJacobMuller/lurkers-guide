<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Thanks for everything</H2>
26 Mar 1998<PRE>Thanks, Cheryl...it's been great.

(And yeah, I remember the "Murder She Wrote in Space" thing, lots of folks said
it...didn't bother me.  There's no reason anyone should believe a TeeVee
producer when saying the sorts of things I was saying, until the point could be
proven.)

And yes, you're right...whatever follows, it won't hold the same place, or have
the same impact, as B5.  It'll be its own show, and it'll be exciting, but B5
will always be a special and unique case.  I know this particular confluence of
events will certainly never come my way again...but it doesn't have to.  It did
so once.  And that's all that matters.
