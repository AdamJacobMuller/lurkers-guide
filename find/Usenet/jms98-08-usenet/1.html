1 Aug 1998<PRE>Thanks...no, I'm still writing, even with the heavy antibiotic medications. 
I'm still going into the office, but on half-day basis, which is about all I
can handle right now (and probably more than I should).  The danger with this
kind of pnumonia is that it can feel like it's getting better, and you push
it...and then it nails your ass to the wall.  (That's what nailed Jim Henson,
who had the same basic kind I have.)
