<H2>Re: How's Joe's health?</H2>
27 Aug 1998<PRE>I'm getting better.  The pneumonia definitely knocked me for a serious 3-4 week
loop.  I'm past nearly all of it now, just a bit weak at times from it all.  At
the Wrap Party, I had to go up and rest between panels and presentations, and
at same wasn't quite as energetic as I'm used to being. 

But it's all pretty much over now...and I got to shed 12 pounds I wanted to
lose in any event (didn't want to do that in 7 days, but there you are).
