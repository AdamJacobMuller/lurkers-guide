27 Aug 1998<PRE>&gt;How do you deal with cutting material?  Is it hard for you?  I notice in
&gt;Lurker's guide that sometimes you have slid things into other episodes. 
&gt;Any other way to use good material that has to be cut?  Can you suggest any
&gt;strategies for editing?

Only one thing works, and that's to pretend the stuff was written by somebody
else, so you can take a fairly objective look at it and cut whatever's dross.
