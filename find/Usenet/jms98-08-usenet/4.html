<H2>Re: B5 on laserdisc</H2>
27 Aug 1998<PRE>I spoke to the folks at Image just before leaving for the UK.  They had been
told, repeatedly, by WB that there *were* no widescreen versions of B5
available.

Well, after hearing this, I gave 'em the names of the folks in the WB high-tech
division who've been conforming the widescreen negatives, and the odds are good
that they're going to do this.
