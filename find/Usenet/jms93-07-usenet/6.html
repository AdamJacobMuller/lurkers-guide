<H2>Something I've always wanted</H2>
27 Jul 1993<PRE>     Yes, the English model is very much what we're going for in the
characters on B5.  No character is safe, and we want to play with them
in some ways not usually done on american TV.  One other difference is
the notion of a single story across X-season, as with many British
series.
