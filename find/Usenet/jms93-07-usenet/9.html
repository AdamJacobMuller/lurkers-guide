27 Jul 1993<PRE>     Alas, I wish I could say that I'm doing B5 in hopes of pleasing the
maximum number of people at all times.  Certainly there would be many
people in town relieved to hear that.  But this is something that I'm
doing because this is just the sort of series that I'd like to watch.  If
I'm lucky, others will feel the same way.  If not...well, them's the
breaks.  This show will either be a hit, or it'll go down in the biggest
fireball since Tunguska.
