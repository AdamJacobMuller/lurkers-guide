<H2>Re: Something I've always want</H2>
29 Jul 1993<PRE>     We're definitely punching up the Commander.  And you're correct; not
all problems in real life are resolved in a day, much less an hour (though
that's really kind of a misnomer; generally the "span" of a TV story may
cover 3-4 days of story time...you just see parts of that story selected
for showing in a one-hour period...sort of the highlights).
 
     We do plan to bring in some things that seem at first unimportant,
then a few episodes down, learn the significance of it.  That can be a
great deal of fun.
