27 Jul 1993<PRE>     Regarding Catherine Sakai...believe me, this ain't a consort kind of
relationship.  It will be monogamous, but difficult in many ways.  This
has been an on-again/off-again relationship between them for years, made
up of three parts passion and two parts teeth.  It will be a very fiery
relationship.  And this is a woman with her own business, her own ship,
who comes and goes as she wishes.  You have to understand that I love
writing strong female characters, and Catherine will be probably one of
the strongest.
