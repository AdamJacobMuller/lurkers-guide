2 Aug 1996<PRE>No, haven't taken that particular test, though while I was in university I
took a number of personality inventories and the like as part of my degree
plan in psychology.  Right up through the MMPI and others.  The career
evaluation inventories indicated that I should be either a clerk or in the
Air Force.
