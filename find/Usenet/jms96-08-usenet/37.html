10 Aug 1996<PRE>"In order to fully understand the message, you must understand the
messenger."


Hrrmm...yes and no.  Understanding the messenger can add a second layer of
interpretation, but the primary layer must stand on its own or it's
flawed.  I don't need to know that Joe Orton was gay to fall out of my
chair laughing at "Loot," don't need to know that Chekhov had a drinking
problem to appreciate "Uncle Vanya," don't need to know that Mark Twain
lost both his daughters tragically to appreciate "Letters from the
Earth"....

Well, okay, I'll give you Twain, as the tragedies in his life fed right
into his later work.  That's the yes part in yes and no.

It's just that I already put out a lot of info on my personal life, likely
more than I should, and the question "what price have you paid?" can only
solicit a self-indulgent and self-serving answer.
