<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Novels vs. TV -- How difficult?</H2>
25 Aug 1996<PRE>"If this is the case (which I know it is), how come there is so much out
there that is, in a simple word, terrible?  I mean, if some of these shows
are the ones that DO get through all this, I shudder to think about the
ones that don't."

Because so much of TV is formulaic, and because the networks often get
into the process too much, knocking off all the corners and edges that
make a concept interesting.  I think that's starting to change, but we'll
see how far it goes.

"Also, does this set-up mean that established writer/producers can easily
get something through that never would otherwise (Steven Bochco and "Cop
Rock" comes to mind...)"

Yes.  The networks often make long-term deals with major producers and set
aside stuff sight unseen.  The 10:00 timeslot is basically "owned" by a
very small group of producers, with the rest of the prime-time hours a bit
more up for grabs.

"On a completely different note, you've written some plays-- how much of a
Producer role did you take on some of those, and how much did you enjoy
that aspect of it-- how does theatre compare to TV?"

I had zip involvement as producer, and wouldn't have been qualified to do
so.  I enjoyed it immensely, and plan to get back into theater one of
these days.
