1 Aug 1996<PRE>"1) Will you be doing a book tour for your scriptwriting book?"

There are no plans for that at present, though I may try to coordinate
something or other when I do the occasional convention.

"2) How can we get your book signed in the event of no book tour?"

Conventions, mainly.  Problem is that the book is coming out right when
we're in the thick of production, and getting away at this time is nearly
impossible.
