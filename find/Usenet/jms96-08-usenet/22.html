4 Aug 1996<PRE>"Do you agree with the Shadows motives?"

Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't.  Motives are one thing; the means to
achieving that motive, however, are a different issue.  And those means I
do not agree with.  But on some level, their motives can make sense...as
can the Vorlons' motives....
