14 Aug 1996<PRE>Actually, just to clarify all this...the site is up, but not officially
all together yet; we're still waiting for approval from WB before putting
some stuff online, and making the full area list available.  Right now
it's basically just a shell, which we'll put things into as we go.  But we
haven't announced the site being up yet because it's still more or less in
beta stage.
