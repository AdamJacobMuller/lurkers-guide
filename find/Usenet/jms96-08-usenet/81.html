20 Aug 1996<PRE>Because Bester is on Earth or Mars, can't just drop everything and come
when beckoned, and it would take 3 days to get there, and they were in
kind of a hurry to test this.  Besides, P10s are very few and far between;
they're more likely to have lower levels as their main weapons, so best to
see what impact those will have.
