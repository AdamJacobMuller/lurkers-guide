<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Driving</H2>
4 Aug 1996<PRE>"I was really surprised to read in the TV Guide article that you don't
drive. How have you been able to live in auto-dependent Southern
California for so many years with out giving in and starting to drive? I'm
amazed that you manage to do it..."

So am I, some days.

It's a moral thing; I'm a *terrible* driver, easily distracted, my depth
perception sucks, and...I hit things.  And they frown on that.  So for the
good of the Commonweal, even though it's a monumental pain in the ass, I
stay off the road. 

So when I can't catch a ride with someone, I have an occasional (per-job)
driver, or I get cabs.  Used to ride the bus all the time.  All the time I
was working at Filmation at the start of my TV staff career I bussed it
in; took about 2-2 1/2 hours to get from Glendale to Encino, approximately
a 45 minute drive by car.

Now it's usually just a car, one way or another, but it's still a pain. 
At the same time, though, I know I could never live with myself if I ever
harmed someone else, so here we are....
