It was the same effect you would get in a massive energy burst that
"paints" shadows on the wall, which only he could see.

And no, there's nothing dangerous at all about a fleet coming out of
hyperspace or a jump point together.

The look of the new Vorlon was developed by John Vulich of Optic Nerve
based on my suggestions.  I got in after a bit and redesigned/sketched the
headpiece a bit, and recommended the colors used.  We're actually doing a
bit of fine-tuning on the new Vorlon prior to next season.
