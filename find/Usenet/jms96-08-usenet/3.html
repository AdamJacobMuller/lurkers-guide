1 Aug 1996<PRE>"How did you pick / decide upon the actors who are presently involved in
the story?  And are you planning on appearances by "named - major"
personalities in upcomming episodes?"

If by this you mean how do we cast the actors...the actor comes in and
auditions, reading dialogue for that character from a given episode.  The
one that comes in the door and is most what I saw in my head when I
created the character, gets the job.
