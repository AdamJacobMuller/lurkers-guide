<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Blow by Blow spoilers..</H2>
21 Aug 1996<PRE>I gave my reasons in a second post on CIS, and would rather have that go
through than repeat it all again at length.  In brief, I just think that
in that much detail, it removes any and all chance of surprise, of seeing
how something happens.  And the episode is held hostage to how well the
person presents the synopsis.  For instance, you could say, "in this
episode, Kosh dies."  Okay, that's a spoiler, and that's fine...the person
can know what to expect, but still not know *exactly* when it's going to
happen, and still enjoy it when it does.

Similarly, if someone does a beat-by-beat and describes something very
flatly, or poorly, it can prejudice the viewer against the episode before
it even airs.  I can't tell you the amount of email I've received from
people who say, "I read this detailed synopsis of X on my listserve, and
from the way it was described it sounded really dopey, but it was great!" 


Bottom line...I didn't ask people not to post them, can't enforce it if I
wanted to, I was just kind of aghast.  Obviously people are gonna do
whatever they wanna do, that's a given.  It just sorta brought me up short
a bit, that's all.  Especially knowing how often this can get in the way
of enjoying the episode, even for those folks who want to be spoiled.
