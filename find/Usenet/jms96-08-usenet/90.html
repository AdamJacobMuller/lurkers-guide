<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Actors' Preparation</H2>
24 Aug 1996<PRE>"I was just wondering how the actors get themselves back in character
after several months off, especially since there is supposed to be
something of a cliffhanger from the end of Season Three.  Will the whole
cast get to sit down and watch the Final Five, or At least the Final One
in order to help get them mentally back into the B5 Universe quickly? 
Have any of them seen the episodes, yet?  I'd love to hear their
reactions!"

Usually they just pick up the script...and get right back into it. 
They've got the characters down now, so there's not a lot needed to get
back into it.  Some of them run lines with each other, like Stephen and
Peter, since that relationship is something very special, but mostly they
just learn the lines and come in.  Some of them want to see the final
episodes, but some don't.  The only one to see most of the last two
episodes thus far is Bruce, who was just totally knocked out by them.  

Peter has said that whenever he needs to get back into character, he just
straightens and says, "MISter GARiBALdi," and he's right back into it.
