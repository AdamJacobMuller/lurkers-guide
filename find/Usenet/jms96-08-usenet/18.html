<H2>Re: Why JMS really believes in God?</H2>
3 Aug 1996<PRE>I love it when people decide to tell me what I *really* believe, or don't
believe, that what I say and think is my view of life isn't really it at
ALL...and then throw all the old, cliched, hackneyed "how can god allow
evil to happen" straw men into the argument so they can be easily shot
down, when that has *nothing* whatsoever to do with my attitudes on the
subject.  And the notion that it takes more belief to have a non-belief
than belief to have a belief is so illogical, so deep in paralogia and
cliched thinking as to be beyond commenting on because any response would
be utterly and permanently drowned out by laughter.
