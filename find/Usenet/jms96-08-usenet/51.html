13 Aug 1996<PRE>"I find your logic slipping a bit. First off to compare what is wanted in
the teachings of the _public_ schools against what is done in the
_private_ church is flawed.  What is done with government money is well
within the right of the people to voice their opinion on."

Except, of course, that the churches have *tax exempt* status, on the
theory that they are separate and apart from the State...yet have been
mingling more and more in politics.  I'm absolutely deleriously happy if
they want to get into politics, but then drop the tax exempt status.  So
given that the church is getting a free ride with our government money, as
you say above, it's well within the right of the people to voice their
opinion on (dangling participle notwithstanding).  

Basically...make up your mind.  Do you want to be involved with partisan
politics?  Do you want to be a part of the State, as many folks now want
to make this a Christian nation?  Then start carrying your fair share of
the tax burden.  It's not fair to say, "we deserve to interfere with
government," then when the tax man comes around say, "we deserve to be
separate from the government."  Choose one.

"While it is very tragic that "doctors" have been killed over this issue,
what I know 
as fact makes me understand it a bit."

That you have put "doctors" in quotes, and indicated you can understand
the wanton murder of civilians, tells me you have just struck your colors.
 So if you knew a baby was going to grow up to be a doctor, who provided
abortion services, would it be okay to abort *that* baby, or just wait
until they're older and kill 'em then?  May as well be efficient, save
college loan money and the like, yes?

And while I see anti-abortion groups lobbying for that aspect, I don't see
many of them offering to adopt crack babies, or babies that are the result
of incest or rape, or funding social services for all the infants that
will be born if they get their way.  Pass every law you can think of to
make sure they're born, protect those rights... then toss 'em aside after
their born.  Sure, that makes sense.  Why didn't I see it before?

"Are the "..." sequences a pause or are you leaving out text? For example
,was the quote "he's curious about death, he's sometimes depressed to the
point of talking about suicide, he tries to reject authority by openly
experimenting with drugs....". All of these would be bad signs."

No, I said I'm quoting verbatim...verbatim means as said, unedited.  They
didn't say that a bad sign was that he's curious about death, just that
he's *curious*, that he's sometimes depressed, and that he listens to
heavy metal music (I forgot that one), and that he rejects authority. 
Broad-based statements.  

The religious right uses fear tactics on a daily basis to get what it
wants.  To describe what they've actually done isn't fear tactics, it's
strictly reporting what happened.  If you find it scary...well, so do I.
