18 Aug 1996<PRE>"I don't know If this has been asked before, but I would like to know if
you are part of the 1/3 who will agree with the Shadows intentions?"

It's...not that easy.  Can I make a pretty good argument for some elements

extremes...their notion is fine, taken in small doses...in larger doses,
no.
