<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Poetry on B5</H2>
4 Aug 1996<PRE>I've read Matthew Arnold, but have always found him a bit dry for my
tastes.  I go for the more passionate, beat-the-drums stuff.  

I'll continue to try to find ways to work in bits of it here and there,
never hurts to let people know there's stuff other than TeeVee out there. 
Should sneak in a much longer version of Tennyson's "Ulysses" early in
season four.
