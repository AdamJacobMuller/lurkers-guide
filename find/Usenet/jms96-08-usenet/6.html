<H2>Re: Mr. JMS: So, which is the best of Final Five?</H2>
2 Aug 1996<PRE>It would be an even tie I think between the final two, "Shadow Dancing"
and "Z'ha'dum."  The two episodes are also linked at the hip, so they're
really more like one unit...not so much a two-parter, but siamese twins,
story-wise.  They're both very exciting, move the arc forward hugely, and
though they rely on a lot of backstory, are also good points for folks new
to the show to dive in, because they also *explain* a lot of backstory, so
they can get into it.

They're both just lovely, knockout episodes.  And, at times, scary as
hell.
