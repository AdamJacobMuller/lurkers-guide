<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Question about maybe new show</H2>
2 Aug 1996<PRE>"This sounds like a very exciting show, but will Netter and Copeland still
be able to perform their duties on B5 or will you have to replace them?"

Doug's job on B5 is primarily oriented toward the business end, so that's
not a problem; John was in on the sale of the project, but now that it's
done, a line producer will be brought in for that show (John's the line
producer on B5), so John will definitely be staying with B5 in his
capacity of producer, and not directly involved in the daily running of
the new show.
