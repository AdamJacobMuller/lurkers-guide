<H2>Re: A Civilian in Babylon</H2>
18 Aug 1996<PRE>No other civilian viewings at the office are planned; this was a one-off. 
It was brought to my attention that in my original response to Wendy,
which was made lightly and in jest, I'd committed a UM, an Unintended
Meanness, and it was important to me to fix that.  This was done.
