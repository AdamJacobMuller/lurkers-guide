<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Thanks, &amp; questions on Foundation &amp; MST</H2>
13 Aug 1996<PRE>I've no idea what Foundation is up to outside B5.

As for MST3K...yeah, I'd heard Trace was leaving.  Vastly unfortunate. 
They've bounced back from losing Joel (and, in some ways, I feel it's a
definite improvement), from the first assistant Mad Scientist (ditto
squared), sorta came back from losing TV's Frank (though Forrester's mom
just doesnt do it for me, and the show still lacks something without
Frank)...but to get by without Dr. Forrester...AND Crow...or at least
Crow's voice and attitude...I dunno.  That's gonna be a tough one.

I met Trace briefly in San Diego, and spoke with him on the phone a couple
of times over the last year or two.  I love MST3K, and my assistant at the
time, prior to Joanne, got the full cast to sign a photo for me, which is
now the ONLY non-B5 item framed on my office wall at the B5 stage.  (In
return, we sent them a batch of B5 caps.)  

So we'll see what happens, they're a good bunch and I'm willing to give
them the benefit of the doubt...but this one's gonna be real tough.
