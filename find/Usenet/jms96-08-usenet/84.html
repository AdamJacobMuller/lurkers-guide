22 Aug 1996<PRE>"I just saw "Passing through Gethsemane" again, and felt compelled to
write, for the first time.  I understand you're not religious, but I just
wanted to take the time out to thank you for your respectful treatment of
the issue in that episode."

Thanks...but it really isn't a big thing, it's just being honest as a
writer.  

And if it's helped urge on your own creative works, as you say, then all
the better.
