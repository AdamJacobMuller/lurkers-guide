<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Writters Question?</H2>
26 Aug 1996<PRE>"1.  How do you go about finding relatively obscure records for
researching a story?  I have tried every resource I know of short of
packing up and traveling a 500+ miles to the city in question just to go
to the library.  And is there a newspaper archive you know of that has all
of the newspapers online? "

I don't know the online databases well enough to comment here; when I did
this sort of thing, I generally just went down to City Hall Records and
started there, and the local newpaper morgue.

"2.  As someone who has written both science fiction and horror, do you
think one is easier than the other to work in."

Horror, only nominallyl, because you don't have to be quite as rigorous
about the science (though the supernatural aspect must be consistent), and
because it's an easier thing for me...I like scaring people.
