<H2>Re: ATTN JMS:Questions about Z'Ha'Dum and some background mythology...</H2>
22 Aug 1996<PRE>"1) Why has Z'Ha'Dum not been destroyed by the Vorlons et al in one of the
previous wars to prevent the Shadows return?"

Funny, that...you'd think maybe there was something of interest there.

"2) If the planet has been there for so long, would not the star that it
orbits have died quite some time ago, given that the Shadows are so old?"

I don't think so.  Stars live an awfully long time.  

"3) Was Kosh inspired by the Russian myth of "Koshchei the Deathless"?"

Nope.

"4) Is the Minbari caste system inspired by the Zoroastrian belief that
was 
prevalent in ancient Babylon? They too divided themselves into 3 castes,
warrior, religious and worker."

I kinda knew about this in the back of my head, so it may have been
subconscious, but if the question is did I consciously do this, no, I
ain't that smart.
