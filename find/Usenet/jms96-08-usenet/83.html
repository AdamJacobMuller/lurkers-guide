<H2>Re: Att JMS: Writers' Boot Camp?</H2>
21 Aug 1996<PRE>Disclaimer: I know nothing about this program except what I've heard
casually around town, so take everything that follows with a grain of
salt.

Anyone who tells you that, by following a formula, you will turn out a
saleable script in 6 weeks is almost always lying.  If the program here is
mainly just in discipline, and that's something you need to apply butt to
chair and fingers to keyboard, then that's a different issue.  So beyond
that, I can't give you an informed recommendation either way.
