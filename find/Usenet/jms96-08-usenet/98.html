26 Aug 1996<PRE>In general, I connect to Usenet via my AOL account, regular 28.8 modem for
that.

I have a couple of web accounts, one on Earthlink (soon to go away) one on
IBM net, using Netscape 2.0 for most stuff, FreeAgent for the rest.

Now, I'd *bought* a Motorola ISDN modem, but even though I've configured
it right, had the lines put in, it's greenlighted...can't seem to connect
to anydamnthing, and I don't have the ISDN numbers for IBM net (and
getting this info, despite some help from a few folks over there, is like
pulling teeth)...I'm wired to the gills, but the triple-damned thing ain't
happening.  Some days I just despair....
