13 Jan 1999<PRE>&gt;As a viewer of B5 since the beginning, I was thrilled to see that you are
&gt;finally making a trip to my part of the world at the MegaCon in Orlando
&gt;March 5-7.  I was wondering which day (or hopefully, days) that you will be
&gt;speaking?

I believe that my main presentation in the big room will be on Saturday;
there's one Sunday as well, but not as big a deal.
