<H2>Re: copyright ownership</H2>
10 Jan 1999<PRE>Standard stuff: any studio owns all the rights to the show it makes.  Paramount
owns ST, not Roddenberry's estate.  Similarly, WB owns B5, lock, stock and
docking bay.  They also own all the designs, the ship models, and all of that. 
It's all copyrighted and trademarked, down to the schematics.
