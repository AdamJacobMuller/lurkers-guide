13 Jan 1999<PRE>I think I'm going to end up doing fewer conventions than in previous years; to
some extent I think I may have gotten over-exposed, and over-personalized the
show when it's the show that should be at the focus.  So yeah, overall I'll be
doing a bit less than usual for the next year or so.
