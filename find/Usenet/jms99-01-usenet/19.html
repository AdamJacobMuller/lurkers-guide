<H2>Re: Season 5 B5 cards</H2>
23 Jan 1999<PRE>I agree, I'm pretty pleased with how this set came out.  Some of the images are
still a bit dark for my tastes, something we tried to address as best we could
with screen grabs, but the set looks very nice.  Though that one picture about
turning out the lights from SiL will doubtless just drive down the price of the
whole darned set....
