<H2>Re: Evan Chen Not on CRUSADE yet!!!!!!</H2>
26 Jan 1999<PRE>If I thought Evan Chen was an error, whether I chose to admit it or not, I
would not have him on as composer on the series.

But it was not an error, as testified by the many folks who've come out of the
woodwork (many of them musicians) to say that they loved the music on ACTA. 
Your opinion is your opinion, and that's fine...but there are other opinions
just as valid.  So don't use your opinion as proof that an error of fact has
taken place, and thus that I'm not admitting it somehow being indicative that
I've changed.

And Evan *is* doing the music on the series.  We've scored three so far, and he
continues to improve with every episode, as Chris Franke improved with every
episode.  WB thinks he's a genuine find.

We will soon be putting up the main title for CRUSADE on thestation.com, and
you can see some more of what he's doing musically, and I have to say it's
great.

I have no intention of making a change in composers for CRUSADE.
