13 Jan 1999<PRE>So in other words, I cannot have or express an opinion of my own.  You can say
that you do not like the CTA music, but I cannot say that I do not like the
droning Voyager music, is that it?  The freedom of expression goes only one
direction?  

Sorry, Von Bruno...that doesn't wash.  Either it's a level playing field or it
ain't.

Go repress somebody else.
