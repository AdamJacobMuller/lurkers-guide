24 Jan 1999<PRE>&gt;1) When you have to transfer the widescreen version of B5 to the regular
&gt;aspect, do you have to pan and scan, or are the side of the screen just used
&gt;as 'beauty space' when shot, and so can be clipped without damaging
&gt;composition?

It's the latter, though we've been composing more for widescreen and actually
putting the edges to good use in Crusade.

&gt;2) Back before B5 satarted and the media interest was muted at best,
&gt;Cinefantastique put together a knock out B5-dedecated issue, with previews of
&gt;most of the first season (when they were called things like 'The
&gt;Ressurectionist' and 'Raiding Party'). Interviews, the whole works. Is
&gt;anything similar planned around the start of Crusade?

Dunno...nobody's said anything about it to me thus far.
