19 Jan 1999<PRE>&gt;PLEASE! I know you couldn't stop the Big Breakfast debacle, but could you
&gt;phone C4 and explain why this is so important to us? You're the only one
&gt;they might listen to!

No one listen to Zathras....not C4...not any other kind of explosives or
gas...very sad...much hangings up at other end of phone...heard that C4 was
taken back in time, was center for great war of britfans...Zathras not know
what britfans means, but is sure it must be important to great war against
darkness....
