19 Jan 1999<PRE>&gt;Sorry to bother you, but I was wondering if you could shed any light on what
&gt;happened to the "River of Souls" novel.  According to Waldenbooks it was
&gt;supposed to come out in mid-December; according to Amazon.com, it's not
&gt;published until December 1999, and it isn't listed at all on the publishers'
&gt;order form in the back of the "Call to Arms" novel.  I'm asssuming it was
&gt;canceled, but was wondering why.
&gt;

We pulled the book.  For a variety of reasons, it wasn't where we wanted it to
be, and the quality we needed it to be, so it was dropped.  We hope we can try
and do something else with the novelist at some point in the future.
