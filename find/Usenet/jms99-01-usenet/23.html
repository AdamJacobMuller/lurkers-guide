<H2>Re: Interesting JMS Quote and Crusade</H2>
24 Jan 1999<PRE>&gt;&gt; I saw this in my archives and found it interesting in
&gt;&gt; respect of the mess Crusade got into having to reshoot
&gt;&gt; material to insert into existing awful episodes.

Nothing was reshot to be inserted into prior episodes.  The episodes are being
aired as originally written and edited.  No changes have been made, no
additional material filmed.
