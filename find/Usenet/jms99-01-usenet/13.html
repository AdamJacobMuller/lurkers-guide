<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Matheson</H2>
18 Jan 1999<PRE>&gt;I noticed that the last name of the first officer of Excaliber in Crusade is
&gt;Matheson. (Hes supposed to be a teep, I think, am i right?)
&gt;
&gt;Is this a nod towards legendary horror writer Richard matheson?

Yup.  I fell in love with Matheson's work as a kid, and since we had Bester in
B5, I figured it might be good luck to have Matheson in Crusade.
