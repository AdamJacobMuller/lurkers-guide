<H2>Re: Evan Chen Not on CRUSADE yet!!!!!! (Ramming Speed Comment)</H2>
27 Jan 1999<PRE>&gt;Um, this is a non-existent concept.  It is meaningless.  The only
&gt;possible maximum speed is light speed.  This is simple ninth-grade
&gt;physics.  What part of this do you not understand?
&gt;
&gt;So long as thrust is applied, your speed increases.  It continues to
&gt;increase forever, never quite reaching lightspeed.  How many times must
&gt;people state simple facts of physics?

This is true only if you do continue to maintain thrust without ever turning
off your engines.  Which means you would burn out your engines, or run out of
fuel.  

This is a pedantic point.  Maximum speed would refer to what this given
starship can do in regular operations, with finite fuel and common-sense
applied to how long and how hard you burn the engines.  A Starfury knows what
its maximum speed is if it ever hopes to return home; it's the OPERATING system
we're talking about, not the greater laws of physics in the universe.  A pilot
just needs to know "How fast can I push this puppy?"  Yeah, a jet fighter can
exceed specs...and he'll black out, burn out, and crash.

This is a case of not seeing forest for the trees.
