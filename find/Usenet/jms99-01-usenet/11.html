13 Jan 1999<PRE>&gt;How's filming going? What episodes have you filmed lately? 

We finished shooting #12 today.  Tomorrow Stephen Furst begins shooting on
"Appearances and Other Deceits."

&gt;(Or does that require Vorlon-level passcodes?)
&gt;How are the old crew and the new cast interfacing?

They're getting along famously; the new cast are a very serious bunch, and
totally dedicated to the work.

&gt;And how are you? Gotten any naps lately? :)

In May.
