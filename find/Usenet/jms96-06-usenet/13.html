<H2>Re: Attn JMS: Chicago ComiCon?</H2>
18 Jun 1996<PRE>Yes, I'll be at the Chicago ComicCon in Rosemont this coming weekend, with
a 2-hour B5 presentation slated for Saturday from 4-6 p.m., and apparently
there's some sort of off-convention B5 reception at 7:30 or thereabouts. 
(Not everyone who enjoys the show wants to pay the bucks for the whole
convention, so this was thunk up last time as a freebie for general fans
in the area at a local hotel.)

A caveat...the B5 presentation has generally been the biggest thing at the
con the last few years, so if you're going to be there, be early,
otherwise the seats get filled and folks get stuck in the doorway and the
hall.  Last time the main room held about 2,000 and still got jammed.

I won't be bringing an episode -- WB isn't allowing this anymore for its
shows -- but can bring clips and other fun stuph.
