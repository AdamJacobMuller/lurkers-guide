<H2>Re: JMS: re. Double-Runs in LA!</H2>
17 Jun 1996<PRE>Thanks; yes, LA will be getting the double runs, as will Chicago, I
believe, and a number of other stations, based on the continuing
improvements in ratings.

BTW, to anyone looking on...sorry I've been silent of late.  I was in the
UK for over a week, and I'm still on the jetlagged side, trying to catch
up.  Have been quiet all around lately, just trying to get my head back
into whatever time zone I'm in, and gearing up for year 4.
