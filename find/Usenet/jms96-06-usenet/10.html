<H2>Re: ATTN: JMS--Production Process, Music</H2>
17 Jun 1996<PRE>In reverse order...

1) Changes between 1st and final drafts are almost always production
changes ("can we put this scene in the Zocalo instead of the sanctuary, so
it'll save us a lighting change and camera move?") and some dialogue
tweaks.  Occasionally a scene will get trimmed a bit if it looks like the
show's coming up long.

2) Music...after John and I have done our cut, we sit down with the sound
effects people and Chris Franke for the spotting session.  Here, we watch
the episode all the way through.  I indicate where I want the music to
start, and where I want it to stop, and what kind of music I have in mind,
if it's that clear to me.  

E.g., "Music in at 12:23:15 (twelve minutes, 23 seconds and 15 frames),
out at 14:10:20.  We've got some heavy sound effects going on here, battle
stuff, which will take up a lot of the bottom and midrange, so you may
want to go for a bit higher frequency stuff.  Strings would be good
through this, counterpointing the battle.  I wouldn't mind if you could
somehow interpolate the Requiem theme through this part."  Chris then goes
off and makes magic.
