<H2>Re: SPOILERS Season 4 First Episode</H2>
3 Jun 1996<PRE>"In retrospect we now know that the Lurker's Guide announcement that B5
has 
been renewed for season 4 was not premature at all."

Incorrect.  The Lurker's Guide said that the show had been renewed.  It
had not yet been renewed, and has not *formally* been renewed yet.  You
don't say the baby has been born if it's still hanging around in it's
mother.
