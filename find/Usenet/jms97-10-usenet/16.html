<H2>Re: Between the darkness and the light</H2>
6 Oct 1997<PRE>&gt;I was wondering if any of the execs at 
&gt;paramount have looked at Babylon 5 and 
&gt;what it has become and thought something 
&gt;like,  "Boy I messed up when I didn't
&gt;grab that show when it was offered to
&gt;me."

No, I doubt it...the only thing that has ever reached us was the frequent
 lament at the top that we're "messing up the franchise that it took (them) us
 25 years to build."
