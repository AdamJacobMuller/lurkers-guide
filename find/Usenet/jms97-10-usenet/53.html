&gt;One question, though:  After all the time and care that you put into
&gt;slowly developing the relationship between John and Delenn, why did
&gt;you choose not to show their wedding onscreen?  I can think of several
&gt;perfectly legitimate reasons for doing this and am mainly curious as
&gt;to what factors went into that decision.

This was something I debated back and forth for quite some time.  I finally
 came to the idea of having it happen off-camera because I thought, frankly,
 that it would come off as corny to show it; it would be an obvious appeal to
 ratings and the like, and I tend to shy away from that.
