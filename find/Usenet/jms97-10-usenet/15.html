<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: copyright issue</H2>
6 Oct 1997<PRE>&gt;I've put together a couple of B5 logo sets and was wondering if I
&gt;would be violating the copyright if I offered them free on my website.
&gt;all the pictures I used were taken from the newsgroups or free sites
&gt;on the web.

I don't actually know the answer to this...my guess is that somewhere in the
 files they would have to have the WB (c) notice, otherwise you run the risk of
 turning them in to public domain stuff, which makes WB very cranky.
