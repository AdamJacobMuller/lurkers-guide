<H2>Re: "endgame" (*spoiler*)</H2>
2 Oct 1997<PRE>You're right in terms of what Garibaldi did and didn't do, and we've avoided
 the ultimate repercussions in other places for other things (he said vaguely,
 not wanting to post spoilers)...but you can only do that so far, and if you go
 further you start cheating.  You also remove the dramatic impact of the
 actions of your characters if they do not have consequences.  In this case, it
 ties very much into this character's background...and would, in another
 universe in which CC decided to stay, have spun out into some rather
 interesting developments.
