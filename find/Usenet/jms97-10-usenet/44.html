17 Oct 1997<PRE>&gt;Joe can you confirm whether or not it is a copy of the WB press
&gt;release. If so, I think I just proved my point.
&gt;
No, it's not.

Look...the article posts items that have not been contradicted by Claudia.  The
 basic series of facts as presented are, as far as I know, unchallenged.  

It says that "opinions differ" on the background of the situation.  No, it
 doesn't give her story on the background, but it ALSO DOESN'T GIVE MINE. 
 Nowhere in there is there any background from this side of the desk.  If one
 side were presented in detail, that's one thing...but NEITHER background was
 quoted in this, only the specific facts of what happened: that she didn't give
 the extension (she admits this), that the deadline passed and the offer was
 withdrawn (ditto).  

Other folks want to fight over the why, fine...the article only had the
 obligation to go into *what* happened, not get into the fannish fight over the
 whys and wherefores...which, frankly, if I'm to be honest, are really none of
 anybody's business...and would never have been had Claudia not started this at
 conventions.
