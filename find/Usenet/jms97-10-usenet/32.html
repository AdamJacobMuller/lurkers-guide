<H2>Re: JMS: Showing all Sides</H2>
14 Oct 1997<PRE>&gt;JMS, you've always tried to show every point of view and what motivates your 
&gt;characters. Why have you not shown Clark's point of view?

I tried to do it through his lieutenants and plenepotentiaries (hope I spelled
 that right, I'm too tired to get the dictionary down).  ISN gives you his
 point of view, ditto for Nightwatch, MiniPax, others.  I think if I had him
 just saying it out loud, it would diminish him much the way that repeated
 exposure to the shadow vessels gradually removed their mystery and menace. 
 Less is more.
