<H2>Re: ATTN JMS - A few good words</H2>
2 Oct 1997<PRE>Thanks...I do get short sometimes (especially under the current conditions of
 the back annoyance, the carpal tunnel, and the pain killers)...but overall it
 work out.

&gt;P.S. Thanks for giving me a reason to get a DDS dish;-]

An interesting idea occurs to me, btw, now that you've mentioned this.  TNT has
 wondered aloud how many people are going to sign up for cable or dishes
 primarily for B5.  If you (reading this) have done so, you may want to let
 them know over at http://www.tnt.turner.com
