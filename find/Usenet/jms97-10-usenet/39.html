16 Oct 1997<PRE>&gt;However, since WB has  dropped
&gt;the  series,  will  they nonetheless continue to release the UK videos
&gt;for the 4th season?

No, WB hasn't dropped the series; it's just airing in the US on TNT, that
 doesn't affect international distribution or video sales.  It'll be the same
 as always.
