<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Endgame &amp; Titles Question</H2>
20 Oct 1997<PRE>&gt;Second, and unrelated, a question occurred to me this weekend.  Will
&gt;"Sleeping in Light" have its own unique opening title sequence and/or
&gt;theme music?

SiL won't air until next year...but yeah, we've done some stuff to the credits.

BTW, saw the first pass today on the S5 title sequence, based on my outline to
 the editors...looks pretty spiffy, and a big difference from what we've done
 before, stylistically.
