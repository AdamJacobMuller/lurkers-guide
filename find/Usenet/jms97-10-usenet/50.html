<H2>Re: Attn: JMS; Episode time shorter?</H2>
20 Oct 1997<PRE>&gt;We've noticed that the episode time has been cut back from the usual 44:00
&gt;even
&gt; to ~ 41:45. What's the story? Is it just our local affiliate or is this
&gt; universal? It doesn't seem like we're missing anything, other than obvious
&gt; edits to fit that have already been discussed here. What's the story?

The time hasn't been cut back, unless your local station is cutting out stuff,
 but the time you give second there is correct.  The only change is that we got
 *back* 30 seconds to put into the show after last season, when they dropped
 the Kung Fu promos.
