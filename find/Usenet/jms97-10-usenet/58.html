&gt;Not only that, but "The Official Guide to J. Michael
&gt;Straczynski's Babylon 5" sounds like one wonderful CD ROM...

I was very iffy on that...I am getting this vague sense that I'm becoming a
 brand name, and I'm suspicious of that sort of thing.  At first they wanted it
 in a proprietary sense, "J. Michael Straczynski's Guide to the Babylon 5
 Universe," but I vetoed that because Jason Brezhinski did 90% of the actual
 work on the thing, researching every smallest detail shown in the series, and
 if anyone should get that credit, it's him.  The final title only came about
 through a lot of haggling.
