15 Oct 1997<PRE>Yeah, it was a bit over the top, deliberately so.

I put it in the category of a boxer who's going up against an opponent who may
 be well matched...and wants to psych the other person out.

If you look at "Give me liberty or give me death!" or similar statements, made
 to rally support or make a point, they're generally bigger than life, a bit
 over the top.  That's so we can know where the top is so we can climb up there
 ourselves.
