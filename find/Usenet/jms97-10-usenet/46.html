<H2>Re: ATTN:JMS Question on the budget</H2>
19 Oct 1997<PRE>Specific dollar amounts are secondary to one basic truth: the studios aren't in
 the charity business.  If a show makes money, if it is a *success*, they keep
 it on the air.  If it ain't, the show is history, it's that simple.  If B5
 were a "failure" it sure as hell wouldn't be on for a fifth year, and we
 wouldn't be in serious, last-stage negotations with WB for a *sequel series*. 
 You don't try and sell a sequel for something that didn't work.

WB has made hideous amounts of money on this show.  From their point of view,
 it's a massive success.  There's simply no other reason they would keep the
 show on the air.  Period.
