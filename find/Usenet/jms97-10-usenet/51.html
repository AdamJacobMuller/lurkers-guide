20 Oct 1997<PRE>In Which our Correspondent Swallows His Fists....

&gt;Given the fact that TNT is putting much more into supporting and
&gt;promoting the show for the final season, do you regret that this kind of
&gt;support has not been there for the previous four seasons?  I know that
&gt;you have had minimal trouble with WB creatively, but they really didn't
&gt;*support* the show as well as they could have.
&gt;Do you think that the hands-off approach made the show better by making
&gt;you work harder?

This is about as much a deal with the devil as I can imagine.

But on the whole, without getting into specifics...the truth is that this show
 is going to be around for 20, 30, maybe even 50 years, if I did it right.  30
 years from now, it won't make any difference if we got good PR or we didn't,
 if we were well received when we first went on or not...the story is the
 story, and I was allowed, most remarkably, to tell it my way, with virtually
 no creative interference, and that will be noted in years to come, not the
 rest.

I'd take that deal again in a hot second.
