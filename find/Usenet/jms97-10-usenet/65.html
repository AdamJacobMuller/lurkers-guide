29 Oct 1997<PRE>&gt;SPOILERS FOR DECONSTRUCTION OF FALLING STARS
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;

Just a few quick reactions:

&gt;(although I did comment on the fact that they
&gt; were still using English in a million years)

That's what you heard, that doesn't mean that's what it was; same as when you
 go to Minbar, they're not speaking English, that's just our hearing of it.

&gt;  BTW when was the last time anyone heard a news anchor talk
&gt; about the old testament? 

Ted Koppel.

&gt; the portrait of him as a kid done in Black and White.  What they
&gt; ran out of color film?

Even now portraits are often done in black and white just for artistic merit.

&gt; (although I have a problem with the idea that NYU will be
&gt; around 100 years from NOW!)

Trinity College is a working college in Ireland that dates back to the American
 Revolution.
