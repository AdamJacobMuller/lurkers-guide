<H2>Re: Attn JMS: Season 5 writing style</H2>
26 Oct 1997<PRE>&gt;Now that B5 has a guarenteed station and timeslot, and the previous
&gt;seasons will be run 5 days a week, does that mean you will be writing
&gt;season 5 with less of the recaps and other nods to "people just tuning
&gt;in"?
&gt;If you see a Klingon on Star Trek, or Cancer Man on X-Files, or Sideshow
&gt;Bob on the Simpsons, etc. etc. ad nauseam, they don't stop and point out
&gt;when and where we saw them before; they just go.

Difference is, this is a continuing storyline, and so I think you do need to
 have the occasional bit of exposition in there for the folks who don't (or
 can't) watch and track every single episode.  You should be able to come in at
 any point in the story, and watch an episode, and get something satisfying out
 of it.

Doesn't really have anything to do with the time slot, it has to do with being
 fair to the majority of the audience.
