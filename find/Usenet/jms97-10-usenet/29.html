<H2>Re: ATTN JMS:  Am I crazy?</H2>
14 Oct 1997<PRE>&gt;I just think it would be great to watch the entire series
&gt;without knowing what will happen next.  I envy the future viewers of the show
 on TNT.

I sometimes think about this myself.  I'd love to be able to see the show the
 way viewers do...without knowing what didn't go right, what got trimmed, what
 line wasn't quite properly delivered...I'd love to be able to sit home and see
 this unfold.

&gt;       And so.  Do you think I'm crazy?  

Just back away from the keyboard and keep your hands where we can see them.
