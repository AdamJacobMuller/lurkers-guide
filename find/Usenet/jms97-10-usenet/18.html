6 Oct 1997<PRE>&gt;Sinclair is stated
&gt;as missing for 48 hours rather than 24, but otherwise it's perfectly
&gt;correct).

That was a typo we *both* missed...

&gt; I don't know if you've noticed this, but if one takes the Arisia 3
&gt;"twice the size" of Earth statistic as meaning twice the volume, it works
&gt;out to a little over 2-G. 

Yeah, she transposed the mass figures when she was putting it all down, and
 hopes to correct this and the above in the next printing.
