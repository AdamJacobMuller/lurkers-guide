<H2>Re: Endgame ( *Spoilers* )</H2>
16 Oct 1997<PRE>&gt;Same with "ramming speed".  There simply isn't one speed that's better
&gt;for ramming than other speeds.  
&gt;But just asking for "ramming speed" is Just Plain Silly.
&gt;It can be retconned, it can be foregiven, but it's Just Plain Silly.

(he taps his foot as yet another expert lurches into the field)

You are in a space ship, in a vacuum, heading toward target X.  You understand
 that it takes time to transfer energy and movement toward another plane, so
 you go at X-speed toward that object if you want the option of applying
 thrusters and angling away from the object before you slam into it.

If, on the other hand, you *want* to hit the object, and you have no interest 
 in holding back your thrusters to allow you to diverge from the target in the
 amount of space remaining between you and it, you proceed at Y speed, with
 your thrusters putting out their maximum amount of fuel.  

Y = ramming speed.
