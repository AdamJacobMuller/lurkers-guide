<H2>Re: ATTN:  JMS,  B5 Cookbook???</H2>
23 Oct 1997<PRE>The book is being edited now, and I should get it soon, so expect it about
 Christmastime.  

Basically, I just think it'll be a hoot.  The recipes are real, with
 substitutions if you can't get the real thing from offworld caterers, and it's
 set right in the B5 universe, as if it were written in that time period, with
 all the usual Chef attitude that goes into it.

I was kinda doubtful when WB first proposed it, and I still haven't seen the
 final manuscript, but I think it could be kinda fun.
