29 Oct 1997<PRE>&gt; What made you decide on the # of shows to do a year.  =
&gt;DS9 for instance does 26 I believe.  Dd the number 22 seem right, or is =
&gt;that standard TV practice?

22 is what a network needs each season to get its money back.

&gt;If you had a million more dollars a show, what would you do with it? 

I'd blow the sides off your TV set.
