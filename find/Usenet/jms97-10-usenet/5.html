<H2>Re: ATTN: JMS you insidious bastard!!!!!!(just kidding)</H2>
2 Oct 1997<PRE>That's good to know.

It's worth noting that I know a number of writers who have been, and in some
 cases are, associated with ST in one incarnation or another (and some of the
 cast), and they have been more than content to have us letting people know
 that the problem is the studio's limitations, not the potential writing, that
 has been the problem...so I'm glad that the studio may be loosening the reins
 a little, possibly due to fan pressure, to let the writers do what they want.
