<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: T-shirt quality</H2>
10 Oct 1997<PRE>Which shirts are you referring to?  If they're the Creation shirts, they've
 been up and down in quality, but they've started working harder.  The All-U
 shirts tend ot be extremely good.

If they're pirated shirts, there's nothing I can do to help you.
