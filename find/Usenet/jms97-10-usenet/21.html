<H2>Re: JMS: Time constraints and video</H2>
11 Oct 1997<PRE>&gt;There are ways of looking at this issue--1) this is a chance to restore
&gt;the original intention and 2) the forced changes really don't matter
&gt;much in the grand scheme of things.  Which side of this issue do you
&gt;come down on?  (As far as I can tell, the only episode you've really
&gt;wanted to get your hands back on is "The Gathering")

Unfortunately, it would require doing a re-edit on the episodes, plus
 re-scoring, and re-mixing, and that takes a fair amount of money, so it's not
 something we can do.
