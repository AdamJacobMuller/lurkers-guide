&gt;Or would the rescue have proceeded much as we saw?
&gt;
Yes, it would have.

Some have complained about the rescue, arguing that they wanted to see a big
 battle.  (To which answer #1 is wait 7 days.)  They wanted to see the fleet
 smack Mars and free him in a big battle.

Well, if you do that, you can kiss goodbye any chance of the fleet then doing
 what it's SUPPOSED to be doing, which is the ligberation of Earth.  While
 they're tied up and planetbound (on one side) at Mars, Earth swoops in and
 knocks them out.  Y ou also lose any possible aspect of surprise.

It *had* to be done quickly, through the back door, rather than the fleet that
 some might have been expecting, so it'd look like a Resistance job, not a
 Fleet job.
