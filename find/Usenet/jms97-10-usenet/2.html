<H2>Re: Sleeping in Light ( *Spoilers* )</H2>
2 Oct 1997<PRE>The other thing in all this to remember is that once I learned the source of
 material for the spoilers' page (the synopses that WB is required to provide
 to TV stations), I made it a point ot have WB route the synopses to me for
 editing.  While I can't force too much stuff out of them or they become
 useless to the purpose mandated by the FCC...stations have to be responsible
 for, and informed about, what they broadcast...I *can* and do omit certain
 little details whenever I can.

Why?

Because the spoilers page pisses me off...because no matter what's in them, I
 get grief over them...and anybody who reads these things (altered or
 otherwise) and assumes they know the full story and goes off because of it
 deserves whatever they get.

The synopses are not for general distribution outside the TV stations; if other
 people are getting them, they're breaking the rules and ruining the dramatic
 impact of episodes by letting the shape of the episodes get out before
 broadcsat, and as far as I'm concerned, that entitles me to fuck with them.
