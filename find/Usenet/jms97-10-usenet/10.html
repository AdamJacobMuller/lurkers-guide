<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Stations are dropping B5 left and right!</H2>
3 Oct 1997<PRE>&gt; Is it at all conceivable that a certain B5-friendly
&gt;cable network could help us out here? 

We're talking to them about some long-term solutions, but to the immediate
 problem...no, there's nothing that TNT can do.

What you're seeing is the reason we couldn't do B5 in regular
 syndication...commitments were made to WBN, to UPN and Fox and other weblets
 that are chewing up ALL the available slots on syndicated stations...there's
 no room at the inn.  Also, we're now a lame duck show for the stations, some
 of which are kind of annoyed that we're now going to cable (their direct
 competition), and don't want to back-handedly promote somthing that's going to
 their competitor.  (I think some of them would have preferred we go quietly
 into that good night than become a competition.)
