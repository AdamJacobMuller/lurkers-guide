30 Oct 1997<PRE>Spoilers for Rising Star

























&gt;1.Did you come up with Zathras(and Zathras, and Zathras, etc.)before
&gt;your morning coffee?

After.  Caffeine akes all the difference in the world.

&gt;2.Can we assume that the wonderful little scene of Londo and G'Kar, at
&gt;the end of Rising Star, wondering how it was going in the Sheridan
&gt;bedroom, and the EYE being misplaced, says a little something about
&gt;Vous????

Absolutely not.

By the way...that's a nice outfit.
