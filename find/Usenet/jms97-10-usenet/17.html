6 Oct 1997<PRE>&gt;Was Between the Darkness and the Light shot after it was known Claudia
&gt;Christian was leaving the show?

Negative.  We'd finished all S4 shooting at the time this occured.

  Unless something miraculous happens in the
&gt;next show....  Were new scenes shot and edited in to the ending?

Negative.
