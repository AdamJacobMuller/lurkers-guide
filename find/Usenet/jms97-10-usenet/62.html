<H2>Re: 422, Questions and observations, SPOILERS</H2>
27 Oct 1997<PRE>&gt;I was surprised that CC was cut from the opening credits. I was under
&gt;the impression that if an actor A appeared as character X in Y number of
&gt;episodes per year, actor A was entitled (actor's guild rules??) to an
&gt;opening credit in every episode that season. 

Because Claudia was in the original 422, it changed the way we had to do the
 credits, since that won't air until 5th season.

&gt;In the end, life looks
&gt;promising, but the getting ther part is pretty ugly.
&gt;
&gt;
Yep, that's the way it usuallly is.
