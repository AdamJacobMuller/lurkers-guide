2 Oct 1997<PRE>I understand what you're saying on one level...but you have to understand that
 for every person who reads the spoilers just to savor what's coming, I get 1-2
 who use it to jump funky on me and complain about what's coming before seeing
 it.

So you might understand why I get a bit cranky about this issue.
