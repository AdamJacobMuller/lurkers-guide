<H2>Re: Between the Darkness and the Light ( *Spoilers* )</H2>
16 Oct 1997<PRE>&gt;Here it is,
&gt;near the end of season 4 and you introduce a new important talent,
&gt;Ivanova's eidetic memory. I'm not saying it's out of character for her
&gt;or that it contradicts anything in the past. My point is that with all
&gt;that came before and your exposure on the web you must have planned this
&gt;well in advance&gt;so as not to open yourself up to "why didn't she
&gt;remember ...?" questions. In a novel, if you or an editor finds a
&gt;contradiction with what came before, it can be changed.


(also taps foot...)

She's a latent telepath.  About a P1.  As has been established on the show in
 the past.  That gives her a slight edge in many areas.

Also, an eidetic memory does not equal facility with language.  I have a
 somewhat eidetic memory.  I can usually remember visuals and things said to me
 with extreme clarity.  (Unless I'm in convention mode at the time, at which
 point all bets are off.)  But I have a real problem with learning languages,
 which involves not just memorization, but *translation,* which is a skill, a
 knack that some others have and some don't.  (Spanish rolled off me, but for
 some reason I have a knack for German, though my vocabulary's gone all to
 hell.)
