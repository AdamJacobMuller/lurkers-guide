12 Oct 1997<PRE>&gt;At Defcon 4 in Tulsa, you mentioned that you had included eight minutes in
&gt;Intersections in Real Time which you pulled and added to Between the Darkness
&gt;and the Light.  Now that both episodes have aired, I hoped you might indulge
&gt;my curiosity by telling me which eight minutes. 

The Garibaldi material through the map sequence with Number One was originally
 in "Intersections."  It got shunted over to 419 when 418 ran 7-8 minutes long,
 and 419 ran 8 minutes short.
