<H2>Re: ATTN JMS:  Earth:FC a B5 redux?</H2>
31 Oct 1997<PRE>&gt;I've watched the first three "Earth: Final Conflict" (EFC) episodes that 
&gt;have shown in my area.  I recall that you were offered the opportunity 
&gt;to participate in its production and turned that down.  Is it fair to 
&gt;surmise now that, compared to "Babylon 5", EFC only offered you a "been 
&gt;there, done that" experience?

Not really...but a) I want to do my own projects, b) it would always be first a
 GR show not a JMS show, c) I had a suspicion htere would be hassles from ST
 fans over it, and d) the story just didn't appeal to me.  I only do stuff I
 can be excited about; life's too short to do otherwise.
