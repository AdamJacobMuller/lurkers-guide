31 Oct 1997<PRE>&gt;	I was wondering, *if* Crusade becomes a reality....
&gt;	Are you really going to subject yourself to this Usenet thing
&gt;again?  Not only is it tough on you as far as the hours you keep, but
&gt;this isn't exactly joyride either.

Not as much, no.  

I promised I'd stay online in a major way as long as the show was being
 broadcast to continue the online experiment...but once that's done, I've
 already decided that I have to pull back and not be as substantive a presence
 as I've been until now.

I won't get off altogether -- I'm an onliner and have been since 1985 and I'm
 too old and cranky to start making major changes to my lifestyle now -- but
 some of the destructiveness of some of the stalkers out there has taken a real
 toll on me over the years.  So I'll still be *around*, here and there, but not
 as constant or major a way as present.
