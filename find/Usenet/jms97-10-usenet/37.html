As long as I'm being cranky (it's 4:30 a.m. and I'm entitled)...I see you based
 this reaction off the teaser.

Y'know, you might actually want to see the episode, and put this in context,
 before calling it "the dumbest line ever voiced in B5" and making fun of
 "running out of bullets."

Spoiler info....






THEY KICKED THE SHIT OUT OF THE SHIP AND BLASTED IT WITH MISSILES AND THE ONLY
 THING HOLDING IT TOGETHER WAS BALING WIRE AND SPIT.

Now...next time...maybe you'll wait and actually *see* the thing before you
 judge something?

Or am I expecting too much?

Y'know...Morgan and Wong from X-Files used to be on the nets a lot, and they
 got out because they were driven to despair by the casual, callous cruelties
 of people who judge harshly and without any kind of information...Mira was on
 for a while, and isn't on anymore, because she says people are just casually
 cruel, they bitch about things that aren't even true half the time.

I know a lot of others, actors and producers, who just don't want to put up
 with this crap.

Some days, I don't blame them.  Some days, I think I'd like to join them.
