<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Effects in "Endgame" *POSSIBLE SPOILERS*</H2>
15 Oct 1997<PRE>&gt;However, one thing I noticed is that the surface "shots" of Mars done by
&gt;your special effects people were beautiful.  Much, much, much better
&gt;than any other Mars shot you have done.

Thanks...actually, most of the prior mars shots were done by an outside
 contractor, who's been doing such shots for the history of the show.  NDEI's
 boys wanted a chance to do them, and did so.

&gt;And, I am including the great
&gt;integration of moving figures on the graphics and the nice shots of the
&gt;shuttles leaving.

Yeah, they're not bad...we still need to improve a bit on the movements, and
 the camera still moves a bit too fast, which gives it that computer-y
 feel...but overall, not bad.

&gt;One thing though...how long did it take too render the Mars exterior
&gt;shots used throughout "Endgame"?
&gt;
Quite a lot, I understand.
