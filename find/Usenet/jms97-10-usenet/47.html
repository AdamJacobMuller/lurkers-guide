<H2>Re: why bother?</H2>
19 Oct 1997<PRE>&gt;If you are sick of people asking you questions or bothering you about
&gt;the whole CC thing, and/or picking at the plot, why do you answer them
&gt;anymore ? 

It's just hard, that's all...I have this belief that refuses to go away that if
 you explain something in a reasonable way, with all the facts at your
 disposal, people will, in the final analysis, generally be reasonable.

I got on here in large measure because I wanted people to *understand* this
 business, and I guess I keep trying to get them to really understand this one.
