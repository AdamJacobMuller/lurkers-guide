10 Oct 1997<PRE>&gt;In the show In Between Darkness and the Light the woman in the
&gt;interrogation room said  "put a BULLET in his head" but, they do not
&gt;use guns any more???  Was this a mistake???

Nope.  We've established (in Grey 17 is Missing, for instance) that guns are
 still used on Earth and elsewhere; but in a space station, you don't want a
 slug-thrower because it tends to a) ricochet a lot off metal walls, or b) cut
 through something vital that would breach the hull potentially.
