<H2>Re: ATT JMS: Updates on your "home town"?</H2>
14 Oct 1997<PRE>&gt;A few times you've mentioned you dream lucidly, and that most (all?) of
&gt;your dreams take place in a town that only exists in your head.
&gt;
&gt;Anything going on there recently? or is it all crowded out by the 2260's?
&gt;
&gt;

I don't know...lately, I've been falling asleep so exhausted that I don't
 remember my dreams...I close my eyes, it gets black, and then it gets morning.
  

We're in the final stages of finishing off the prequel, and between that and
 everything else, I got a grand total of 90 minutes sleep yesterday through
 today.
