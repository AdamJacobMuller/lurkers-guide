21 Oct 1997<PRE>&gt;1. When you write, do you put in the "change of scene" to the special
&gt;effects scenes - the scenes which will be added after the cast filming -
&gt;or do you format the final product after the effects are done - in
&gt;editing?

I don't quite understand the question...all of the show, every single shot, CGI
 or live-action, is spelled out in the script, which is given to the various
 departments to make it happen.

The best way I can demonstrate this is if you want to go to your local library
 and find a copy of my writing book, and check the script for The Coming of
 Shadows against the episode.

&gt;2. How much of the final product is like what you have imagined?? More?
&gt;Less? Do you ever change the layout of an episode BECAUSE of the
&gt;finished visuals?

It's generally 80-110% of what I saw in my head.  Sometimes I'll shift around
 the scenes to better the flow of an episode once we see how they look on film.
