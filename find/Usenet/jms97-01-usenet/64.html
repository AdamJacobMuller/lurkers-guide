30 Jan 1997<PRE>I just got in the full-color proofs of the main book, and it's not only
gorgeous, it's the best single compilation of B5 universe information that
I've ever seen.  They had to do a fair amount of filling in the gaps here
and there, but what went in fits perfectly, and I highly recommend it. 
They went to a great deal of work and research on the show, and you can
see it in every panel.

So it should be out soon, since this is the final version.
