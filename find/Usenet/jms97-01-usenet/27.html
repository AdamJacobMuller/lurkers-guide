18 Jan 1997<PRE>"This is what concerns me about a B5 spin-off.  If the show now becomes
too
popular, the anticipated spin-off just may turn into "Moppets in Space". 
I guess I don't have much confidence that the successors to B5 will not
turn into Voyager."

I created B5.  I didn't create Voyager.  And I have no interest in doing
moppets in space or anywhere else unless I can run a truck over them.

This ain't gonna be a problem.
