<H2>Re: F1 Resolution - Too Easy? (Spoilers 406 -&gt; )</H2>
29 Jan 1997<PRE>&gt;Thanks to the super-wonderful Spoiler Junkies page
&gt;the apparent resolution of the problems imposed by the
&gt;ultra-powerful First Ones is revealed. 

Except, of course, that ain't what happens in the episode.

That's what you get for reading spoilers instead of watching the episode,
especially summaries which a) sometimes don't present the whole picture,
and b) which I've lately been able to get my hands on and, even though the
main story has to go out, I'm able to...edit out...little but important
details, JUST TO PISS OF PEOPLE LIKE YOU WHO READ THE DAMNED THINGS!

Finally, FINALLY, I have my vengeance over the spoiler junkies....ha HA
ha-ha-HA ha HAAAA....

I need a vacation....
