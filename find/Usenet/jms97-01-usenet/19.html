14 Jan 1997<PRE>Lots of our cast members have always done projects on the side; Stephen
did the Misery sitcom, Andreas has done some feature work, including
Executive Decision, Peter did a miniseries for cable...the Lady Law gig
would've required one day a week just introducing stuff a la Robert Stack
on Unsolved Mysteries.
