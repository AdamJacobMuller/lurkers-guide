<H2>Re:  ATTN JMS: "End of History?"</H2>
24 Jan 1997<PRE>"the end of history" is a term used by some sociologists, historians and
social scientists to describe significant changes...some of them are
referring to the present as the end of history.  That's a VERY poor and
inadequate explanation of the term, and I'm confident that others here
probably know the details and can explain it better than I can.
