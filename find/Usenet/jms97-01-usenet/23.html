16 Jan 1997<PRE>Thing about the autographed cards...there was no money involved in this,
it was done as a cool thing for the fans.  (Okay, I *did* ask for a full
set of the Kingdom Come cardset, because I didn't want to run all over the
planet running down chase cards)...and man, you have NO idea how long it
takes to sign 900 cards.  Hours, I tell you...hours and hours.

I suppose I could've signed more, to make more available to fans, but my
right hand fell off and it took a day and a half to stich it back on
again.
