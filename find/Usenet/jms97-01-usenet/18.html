<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Legality of burning downloaded clips into CD</H2>
10 Jan 1997<PRE>If the clips were provided by WB, then I imagine it's legal, though again
I'm not an attorney and am speaking off the cuff; if they're grabs off the
broadcast, they're illegal to START with if they're being distributed over
the net, so any secondary use is equally unlawful.
