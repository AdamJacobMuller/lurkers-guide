<H2>Re: Ratings for syndicated action shows</H2>
23 Jan 1997<PRE>"Someone should tell me why someone like me can't like B5 AND DS9 without
having to defend one or the other; I like 'em both, don't shoot me!"

I couldn't agree more.  My quibble was with those who look facts they
don't like in the face and write them off as "naysayers."  Numbers is
numbers, but personal tastes are personal tastes, and as far as I'm
concerned, the more SF the merrier.
