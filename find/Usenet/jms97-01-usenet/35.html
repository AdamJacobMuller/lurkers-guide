<H2>Re: Babylon 5 &amp; Mormonism</H2>
20 Jan 1997<PRE>"Two data points a statistical proof does not make, but the similarly
between the names, and the similarity of the Mimbari/Earth soul transfer
to the Mormon teaching (correct me here if I am wrong) that in the next
life our souls go as a type of god to another planet to populate it make
me wonder if there is some Mormon influence in the B5 mythos."

Not no way, not no how.
