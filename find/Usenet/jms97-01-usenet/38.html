<H2>Re: Ratings for syndicated action shows</H2>
21 Jan 1997<PRE>DS9 is still toward the top of the ratings, but the "naysayers" are
correct about the decline in actual numbers.  (And DS9 does fall below
Xena and Hercules in many cases, btw.)

Here are the Neilsen figures for DS9 for the last several quarters:
4th quarter 95: 7.1
1st quarter 96: 6.7
2nd quarter 96: 5.9
3rd quarter 96: 4.8

The jump in 4th quarter 96 is apparently due to a lot of new eps airing,
and some stunting...the Tribbles episode and the like.

By comprison, here are B5's numbers of the last number of quarters:
3rd quarter 95: 2.7
4th quarter 95: 2.9
1st quarter 96: 3.0
2nd quarter 96: 3.1
3rd quarter 96: (being retablulated for some errors)
4th quarter 96: 3.6

DS9's season-to-date average has gone from 6.8 to 6.1.
B5's STD average has gone from 3.0 to 3.3.

And our demographics continue to be better than DS9.

This isn't a qualitative statement, only to confirm what has been said:
that DS9's ratings have been declining (also noted by the trades, which
have found drops from 18% to 20% for both the ST shows) and that B5's
ratings have been growing during the same period of time.
