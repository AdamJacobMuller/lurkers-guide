<H2>Re: JMS: Your bag of tricks</H2>
19 Jan 1997<PRE>"Is "the online experiment" also now in your bag of tricks? I.e. assuming
you get to season 5, the 2 TV movies and/or Crusade, do you intend to have
the same presence online or do you want to appear in forums and newsgroups
less often?"

Thing is...I don't consider the online thing part of my bag of tricks,
which mainly I would consider technical or literary or structural devices
used in the writing.  

You've got to understand that I didn't just jump online when B5 rolled
around.  I've been online since about 1984..logging onto Compuserve and
other BBSs via a Kaypro II with 64K RAM and 128K floppies, NO hard drive. 
When B5 came along, I just kept doing what I'd been doing from the start. 
More of it, granted, but it's the same thing.

So in future...yeah, I imagine I'd keep online, until it finally drove me
nuts.  Perhaps not as much as now, only because the CTS acts up more some
days than others, and it's only going to get worse and I'll have to
concentrate that on the writing...but yeah, I'll be here.

I've always been here.
