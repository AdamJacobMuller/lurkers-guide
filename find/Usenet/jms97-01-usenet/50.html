<H2>Re:  ATTN JMS:  Toys, premiums, tie-ins, and your input</H2>
25 Jan 1997<PRE>We haven't done a whole lot of merchandising mainly because I want to get
into that slowly, and not let it begin to influence the show or put
priorities in the wrong order.  

I work to varying extents with the licensees, but basically I get input at
every stage of the product's development, from conceptual artwork or
outlines, through to the final product.  

For instance, today I got the revised transparency for the Delenn
collector plate coming out from Hamilton...and it's gorgeous, just signed
right off on that one, probaby the best of the two I've seen so far (#1
being Sheridan).  Delenn/Mira almost glows off the image at you.  Others
require more more work...when the novels come in, I do what I can, but
often the deadlines are so tight that in the past it's been hard to get
all the stuff I want revised, revised.  This time on the next 3 I worked
more hand-in-glove at the outine stage, so that they would be better.
