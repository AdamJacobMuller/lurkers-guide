30 Jan 1997<PRE>"Are you at all concerned that, when it's all said and done, that some
fans will scratch their heads and wonder:  "You mean thats it?""

No, I don't think so.  The story for "Sleeping in Light," the last B5
episode, is such that it is completely moveable, and self-contained, and
buttons down the arc in what I think is a very moving fashin.  I think
that when it's all said and done, the average reaction will be to sit back
and say, "That was a good story."  Obviously you can't please everyone,
and you can't expect to.  But basically, yeah, I think it's going to end
well.
