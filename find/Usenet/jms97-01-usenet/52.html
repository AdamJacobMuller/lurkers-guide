26 Jan 1997<PRE>No, at this point it's all between WB and the stations.

One other complication to all this is that both WBN and UPN are adding
another night each, and that chews up more available spots...and there are
a LOT of other new syndicated shows coming out, from Stargate to Total
Recall and others, and X-Files, NYPD Blue and Homicide are all also
hitting syndication at the same time, so it's very, very, very scary out
there right now.
