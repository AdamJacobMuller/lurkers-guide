1 Jan 1997<PRE>The emotional impact is always strongest in the writing of the scene
itself. 

The only way to write scenes such as the ones you list is to feel them
yourself, as strongly as the characters do.  Anything less, and it comes
across as fake or forced.  I felt very strongly when I offed Kosh...it was
very difficult for me, which was good, because then I knew it'd be hard on
others as well.
