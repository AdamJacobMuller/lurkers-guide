<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Changes in belief</H2>
5 Jan 1997<PRE>"During the creation, writing and producing of Babylon5, have any of your
everyday beliefs been changed by your work? Has the planning and
construction of say an individual scene or theme ever had a profound
effect upon any of your personal views?"

Changed...no, I'd have to say not.  What it has done is clarify much of
it.  If I'm going to deal with some of these issues, I have to sit down
and really *think* about them...what do I think, what do others think, and
why do I/they think what I/they think?  So it has a tendency to make one
more reflective.  And while I've got pins stuck in a few things -- so I
can come back and consider them again when I have time -- overall, no, not
really.
