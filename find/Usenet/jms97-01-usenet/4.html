<H2>Re: Attn JMS:  Delay in Season 4 title - waiting on year 5?</H2>
1 Jan 1997<PRE>No, I'm mainly just sitting on the title because I'd like to set up the
next movment into which that title plays; it's something that's said in an
episode, and I want it to have the right context.  So I'm just sitting on
it for a bit.  It's not waiting for any outside factors; John and others
know the title, which is the title for episode 415.  No big.
