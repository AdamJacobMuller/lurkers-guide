8 Oct 1995<PRE>     Since this has come up, I went back and checked the source, and did
a verbatim quote of the article that appeared in a recent (this past week)
edition of the Los Angeles Times.  Because nobody should accept info minus
attribution and provenance.  The comments came from Kerry McCluggage, the
head of the Paramount Television Group; other comments were from Berman.
