<H2>JMS:  Alice Cooper influence o</H2>
30 Oct 1995<PRE>     No, no nod there.  (Again, same thing as my last note.)  It's a
longstanding device, used by therapists, it's a big part of the Synanon
game (for those who know what that is)...Alice Cooper used that kind of
structure, but so did Meatloaf in "Life Is A Lemon And I want My Money
Back."  (What about your childhood?  What about love?)  It's in many
poems from the Beat Poetry period...it's a device with a long tradition.
(Heck, read the book of Job sometime.)
