3 Oct 1995<PRE>     Saw the second installment of "Space" the other day; very good, I
thought.  Vastly encouraging.  Continued good luck to them.
 
     (One aspect of this general discussion...when the B5 area goes up on
AOL, and then later on the web, it's designed to have sections dedicated
to *other* SF shows as well, to encourage folks to check them out, on the
theory that other shows in the genre are not a threat, but a bonus for
everyone, healthy competition.)
