<H2>ATTN JMS: ISN question - How c</H2>
28 Oct 1995<PRE>     There are other networks, but the cost of a hyperspace/tachyon link
to places like B5 is prohibitive, so they're fairly local.  ISN has
relays and branches in lots of places.  It would be fair to say that ISN
is taking heat from the EA gov't to portray things a certain way, yes.
Where this leads, we'll have to see.
