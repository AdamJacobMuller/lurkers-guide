8 Oct 1995<PRE>     BTW, to Jeannette, Laura, JM Egolf, Sarah, all the others, thanks
for openly discussing what are surely difficult issues; it's been very
instructive, and helpful for the future.  And the discussion itself has
been moving and insightful; thanks for risking and giving in this way.
