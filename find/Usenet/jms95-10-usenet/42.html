<H2>ATTN: JMS Your opinion on comi</H2>
13 Oct 1995<PRE>     I wasn't terribly pleased with the artwork on 9 and 10, I thought it
could've been much better.  As for the story, David Gerrold had proposed
(and written) that as an outline for an episode; I said I didn't think it
worked for our show.  Which opened the door for DC to pick it up, and since
he felt so strongly that it *did* work, I figured I'd let him proceed.
