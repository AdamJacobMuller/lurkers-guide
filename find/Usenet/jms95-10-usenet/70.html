<H2>Kosh's appearance (Spoilers_)</H2>
27 Oct 1995<PRE>     This is not a bad assessment, Nicholas.  And yes, I remember that
quote from CS Lewis, very evocative.  (Have read the Screwtape Letters,
Perelandra, That Hideous Strength and others.  He sometimes indulged in
straw-man logic, but always written entertainingly.)
