28 Oct 1995<PRE>     Sometimes we do use two cameras, yes, usually for big scenes with
crowds and lots of action.  If you're in tight, it's hard to light for
both sides; the light generally goes just one way, then you relight for
each new angle.  Even so, we run two cameras often, but not always, as
the cost is prohibitive.
