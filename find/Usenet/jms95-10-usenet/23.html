8 Oct 1995<PRE>      Dave Thomas: exactly...a rumor is exactly that, and sometimes it's
a way of testing the waters.  If DS9 fans want to make sure the show stays
around, they need to support it.  Right now, nothing's been decided, and
I made that eminently clear in my original message about this.  There's
much still being discussed; even Berman in that LA Times article worried
that they may have "gone to the well too often."  I think they're going to
wait until the 30th anniversary hoopla is over before making a final
determination.
 
     Meanwhile, thanks for confirming what I said, that this stuff is out
and in the streets around town, as well as being indicated in industry
related articles.
