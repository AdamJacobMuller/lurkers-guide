<H2>To JMS: Congratulations!!  &lt;DL</H2>
19 Oct 1995<PRE>     Christian: I quote Mark Twain: "The test of any good fiction is that
you should care something for the characters; the good to succeed, the
bad to fail.  The trouble with most fiction is that you want them all to
land in hell, together, as quickly as possible."
