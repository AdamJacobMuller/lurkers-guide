<H2>Re: jms is anti-Trek?</H2>
13 Oct 1995<PRE>     To John Lawrence Morgan: no, I don't get to watch ST very often;
that's because doing this job is a 25-hour-a-day responsibility.  I'm at
the B5 offices from early in the day until 7:30-8:00 at night, I grab a
fast meal, sometimes just a sandwich, and charge into my home office and
start writing.  I try to break away for a very few shows; American Gothic,
Space, the Simpsons, X-Files and 60 Minutes during the course of the week.
I have no time for anything else.  That's why I log on here often at 3 a.m.
because that's the only time I have left after work.  (Today's an
exception; I get to work at home today since we've given the crew a couple
days off to catch their breath.)
 
     And yeah...given the choice between spending those last couple of
hours vegged out watching TeeVee, and coming on-line and hanging out with
people, almost my last vestige of human (sorta) contact...I choose the
latter.  What in this do you have a problem?
 
                                                                jms
