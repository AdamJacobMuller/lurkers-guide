<H2>ATTN JMS: Murder1 &amp; B5</H2>
19 Oct 1995<PRE>     I for one would love nothing more than to claim that B5 "paved the
way...for Murder One," but truth is...the network folks probably haven't
even noticed.  From all I hear, Murder 1 has more to do with the long
term fascination with the OJ trial than anything B5.
