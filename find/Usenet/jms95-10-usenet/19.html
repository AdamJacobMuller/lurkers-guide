<H2>ATTN JMS - Season 4: we'd all</H2>
8 Oct 1995<PRE>     All you can do is make your voices heard at the local level; station
programmers are required by FCC rules to operate "in the public's interest,
necessity and convenience."  So they have to be responsive to letters and
petitions.  Beyond that, it's all beyond my control; only local voices will
make a difference.
