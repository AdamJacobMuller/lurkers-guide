<H2>ATTN JMS: "The Sky" as deliber</H2>
6 Oct 1995<PRE>     Some references to the sky are just that and no more; other times
it is a process of playing to archetypes and sensibilities.  There are a
number of recurring images and thematic elements in the series, which
sometimes combine into new elements.  This coming year we'll hit the
topic of pride quite a bit, and loyalty, and what loyalty *means* when
the house of cards begins to fall apart...my sense is that for all the
stuff going on on the surface, there has to be an equal or larger amount
of subtext, stuff going on sub rosa, like a shark gliding beneath the
water.  'Cause that's where all the *really* interesting stuff happens.
