6 Oct 1995<PRE>     Patrick: at Toronto Trek, Majel told an assembled crowd that she
felt badly about the misunderstanding, and wanted to call and apologize;
she went to either Berman or Pillar to get my number (can't recall now
(3v`Wr$dwhich she said)...and told a very funny story of what happened then.
