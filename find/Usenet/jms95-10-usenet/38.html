<H2>Re: JMS' powers of prediction</H2>
13 Oct 1995<PRE>     Actually, the plan to run TNG originally for just 5 years was
specifically *stated by Paramount* to the news media, nothing to do with
predicting anything.  Also, at that time, I knew a lot of folks who were
working over at TNG as writer/producers, and that was what they had all
been told was the case.  When the show finally began to kick into gear,
ratings-wise, they decided to extend it to seven years, and it took quite
a bit of finageling to get everyone back on board (that was why they did
the Borg two-parter with Patrick Stewart...if he had decided not to sign,
they would've used this as a means of getting rid of the character); you
don't have to do this IF YOU HAVE OPTIONS ON THE ACTORS.
 
     There was no predicting involved.  I reported what was being said by
those directly involved with ST:TNG at the time, what was in the press,
and what was being told to agents.  Nothing more, nothing less.  Five
years WAS the original plan; check the first newspaper articles about the
show, it's all over the place.
