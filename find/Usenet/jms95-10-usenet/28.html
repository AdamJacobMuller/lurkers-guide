<H2>ATT: JMS -- WAS JMS on Cmpsrv:</H2>
11 Oct 1995<PRE>     "What's the difference between 'having a Minbari soul' and 'having
been a Minbari in a previous life'?"
 
     The difference, Jamie, is *huge*.  And extremely significant.
 
     Here, I'll give you a freebie...there's something massively,
mind-bendingly significant in a throwaway line in one of the first three
episodes of year three that seems to have little bearing on this, but in
fact is hugely involved in this *exact* issue.
 
     You'll know what it was much later in the season.  But this heads-up
might point you in the right direction.  Suffice to say there's a very
definite reason I phrased that as I did.
