<H2>Re: Attn Jms:  More PKD in B5,</H2>
30 Oct 1995<PRE>     Okay, I've just read a bunch more of these...okay, I admit it, you
got me...I'm doing Philip K. Dick right down the line...and I'm also
doing George Orwell right down the line...and I'm doing Lord of the
Rings beat for beat...and Chalker...and...and Cherryh...and I'm doing
a variation on the Bible, and King Arthur, and the history of Babylon,
and the Idylls of the King....


     What?  What's that you say?  You can't be doing all of these right
down the line, all at the same time?  Sure I can.  Because there IS no
B5.  There's a blank signal that registers in your brain, triggering the
last thing you read, or the most important thing you read.  It's a
carefully rigged US Government psychological warfare experiment.


     I give up.
