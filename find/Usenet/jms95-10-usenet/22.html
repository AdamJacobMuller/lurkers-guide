<H2>Two B5 movies coming?</H2>
8 Oct 1995<PRE>     Formal reply: NO B5 movies are currently "in the pipeline," not one,
let alone two.  It's something Doug (my partner) has said he'd like to do
someday, but then he'd also like to fly under his own power.  There have
been NO formal discussions on this at all.
