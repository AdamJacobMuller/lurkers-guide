<H2>Attn JMS: CTI Thoughts/Feeling</H2>
29 Oct 1995<PRE>     Will: thanks, and you're quite right; it does say something about the
Vorlons that they'd use Jack for this purpose.  Now we just have to further
define what that is.


     BTW, just to append it here, not strictly appropos of your message...
I've noted a number of people say, in essence, "Boy, was I disappointed
that he said Jack at the end, what does he think we are, morons?"  And I've
seen plenty of comments from people who didn't know it was Jack until that
very last moment, for whom it was a revelation.


     It's pretty clear, to lots of folks, that the test was in some ways
(most, actually) more for Delenn's benefit than Kosh's...lots of folks got
this...and then others have said, "Well, if that's what he meant, why
didn't he just have one of them come out and SAY this, say what was learned
or that this was for THEIR benefit?"


     So frankly, whether one comes out and says something, or does not come
out and say something, someone on one side or the other is going to give
you a hard time about it.


                                                                      jms
