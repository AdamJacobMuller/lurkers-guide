<H2>ATTN: JMS You Got Competition</H2>
11 Oct 1995<PRE>     I'm quite happy to have competition.  The more the merrier.  As an SF
fan myself, I love nothing more than seeing good SF on the air, and I have
to say I *very* much enjoyed the last Voyager episode, I'm quite happy
with X-Files, I'm in love with a lot of the dialogue and camerawork on
American Gothic, I've enjoyed all the Space episodes to date...the more
voices, the more competition, the leaner and better the overall result.
