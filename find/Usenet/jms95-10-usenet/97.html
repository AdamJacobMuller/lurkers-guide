<H2>ATTN JMS:The Quintara Marathon</H2>
30 Oct 1995<PRE>     No, I've never read them.  "I am wondering if they had any relation
to B5."  No, because that is called plagiarism.


     I'm not yelling at you, James, I'm just taking a moment here to make
a general comment.


     Ahem.  To everyone looking on.


     STOP ASKING ME IF I AM DOING ONE BOOK OR ANOTHER BY ANOTHER WRITER.


     That is called plagiarism.  It's called theft.  It's not a question
that novel writers get, only TV writers.  I know that's not your intent,
but that's what it is.  I didn't fight for five years to make this show to
do somebody else's story.  This is its own story.  Nobody else's.  It may
not occur to you -- likely does not -- but this is a *supremely* offensive
comment to any writer.  It implies that one cannot come up with one's own
story, one has to borrow or rip off from somebody else...again, a comment
usually directed toward TV writers.  I've never seen a novelist asked if
he was doing somebody else's novel.


     I may sometimes nod in tribute to those works that have come before,
but that's all it ever is.


                                                                   jms
