<H2>Query:  Will the Shadows attac</H2>
21 Oct 1995<PRE>     Babylon 5 is still needed for their own purposes, as an easy way to
keep an eye on things and get to the people they need to get to, so
there's no need for them to attack B5.  They certainly wouldn't do so
just because Morden was busted...that's beneath their concern, as long
as he keeps his mouth shut.  Which he did.  Doesn't mean, though, that
in fairly short order they won't take steps to be as sure as they can be
that, in fact, the secret *is* still secure....
