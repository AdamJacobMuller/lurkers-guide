<H2>Attn Jms:  More PKD in B5, wha</H2>
27 Oct 1995<PRE>     Nope, sorry.  "Garibaldi" comes from the Italian war hero of the
same name.  Have never read Dick's "Exegenis," and that has nothing to
do with "Exogenesis" the episode.  Don't know anything about any row
between PKD and HE.


     I'm chagrined to say that I've read *very* little of Dick's work,
though I did read "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep," which of course
became Blade Runner.  He just got a wee bit weird, even for me.


                                                               jms
