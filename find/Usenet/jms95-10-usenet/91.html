<H2>ATTN JMS:  Maybe setting recor</H2>
30 Oct 1995<PRE>     Actually, it was pointed out to me recently that as far as can be
determined (and if there's any solid info to the contrary, I'll gladly
take it) that no one has ever single-handedly written a full season of
a dramatic, one-hour series.  Even David Kelley often uses co-writers on
many of his episodes of ER and Picket Fences.  I have not yet set this out
as a personal challenge, because I think you have to be open to what may
come your way from other places.  But it's something I'm keeping a vaguely
interested eye on....
