13 Oct 1995<PRE>     "JMS loves the fact that you worship him...."
 
     Yessir, boy-howdy, and there ain't nothin' like signing onto your
account and seeing ten gazillion messages titled JMS IS SOMETIMES / ALWAYS
/ GENERALLY / 99.9% FULL OF SHIT to make you feel like the living
reincarnation of Thor hisownself.
 
     "you ain't never gonna be on the show" ... actually quite a few folks
on the nets have come by the Babylon 5 stages, have been paid to edit music
videos, have even come to *work* for us...PwdrdTstMan from AOL now works at
the B5 stages, another internetter known to most folks here is now working
at WB on the B5 AOL page, others have come here as well, even as extras a
few times.
 
     "and you ain't havin' dinner at Master JMS' estate."  As soon as
Master JMS *gets* an estate instead of a fairly simple 3 bedroom house in
a reasonably nice neighborhood, I'll let you know if this happens or not.
In the interim, I've had dinner and lunches with folks from the nets for
quite some time now.
 
     "thrill of a lifetime feeling that they are actually interacting with
their 'god'"   See paragraph 2 above.  Amazing how if anyone does anything
of merit, and some folks acknowledge that, others have to characterize
that in Deity terms.  Is there no in-between?  Oh, silly me, it's just a
rhetorical device to deride the issue at hand; sorry, for a moment there I
thought you were interested in accuracy, Ross.  My apologies.
 
     And frankly, if I were ANY kind of deity, I'd have a LOT more hair and
a *MUCH* deeper voice.
