<H2>ATTN JMS: Back door into plot?</H2>
19 Oct 1995<PRE>     Yeah, originally it was the Kosh-scan that would've gotten Lyta in
trouble; the TK aspect was originally going to come in from another angle,
but I was able to collapse the two in Talia, and then bring Lyta in from
a different direction, as you'll see in one of the first batch of new
year 3 eps.
