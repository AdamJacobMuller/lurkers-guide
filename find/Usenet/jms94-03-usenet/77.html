<H2>*NOT* an urban legend; was Re:</H2>
31 Mar 1994<PRE>     Nope, Harlan doesn't mention the "little fuck" story in Glass Teat
or elsewhere, as it didn't happen.  He's bemoaned to me many times that
this story has attached itself to him.  Didn't happen.

                                                                       jms
