<H2>Re: Straczynski: Racist or Cut</H2>
24 Mar 1994<PRE>     Who did pick Malcolm for the guy's name?  I did, in the premise
that I gave Dorothy Fontana.  I liked the sound of it.  I often go for
the *sound* of a name, and how it matches the character.  Anybody who
makes more of it than that has some issues of his/her own to deal with.

                                                                 jms
