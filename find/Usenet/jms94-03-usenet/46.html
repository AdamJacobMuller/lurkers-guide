<H2>P5: And The Sky Full of Stars(</H2>
21 Mar 1994<PRE>     Okay, now noting that Janulewicz voted to give "Sky" a score of
ZERO...here comes my question.  How legitimate can your poll be if there
are clearly votes thrown in to skew the thing?  I've noted this guy's
votes before, and he tends to vote *substantially* lower, often in a
random-seeming way.  Obviously he sent in a 0 vote simply to screw things
up.  Is there no way to filter these things out?  Because otherwise it
just encourages mindfuckers to play at keeping the numbers low, in a way
that has *nothing* to do with the show itself.

                                                               jms
