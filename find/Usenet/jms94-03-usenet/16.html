7 Mar 1994<PRE>     To reveal the first two ages would be to reveal the third.
 
     Yes, negotiations have been ongoing for a comic book series, and it
seems to be finalized, though I can't comment officially yet.
 
     The PPGs are Phased Plasma Guns, using superheated helium.  It
doesn't ricochet like conventional slugs, dissipates quickly after a hit,
can be adjusted to produce surface damage, or cut straight through the
body, or to make a big impact without burning through.  At full strength,
they burn straight through any kind of body, causing massive internal
burns and damage to the internal organs.  The clothes melt right into the
skin.  It's not a pretty thing.  Generally they're operated at a lower
or less lethal setting.
