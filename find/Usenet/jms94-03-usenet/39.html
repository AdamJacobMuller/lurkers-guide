<H2>JMS How have you been influenc</H2>
18 Mar 1994<PRE>     The conversation is most useful as a sort of "sense of the room,"
if the comparison is clear.  I find that a lot of it reinforces what I
suspected.  As for yeaer two...won't know until next month sometime.

                                                                   jms
