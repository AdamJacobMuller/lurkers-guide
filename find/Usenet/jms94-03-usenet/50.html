<H2>JMS: praise</H2>
23 Mar 1994<PRE>     The only problem with a personal log is that that's pretty  much
associated with Trek, and I think that the way we've got it mapped out,
it won't be necessary.  Any info a person needs for an episode will be
contained or restated within that episode.  Thank for the note.

                                                                      jms
