<H2>Schedule?  Repeats already?!?</H2>
21 Mar 1994<PRE>     Here is the dilemma in which we find ourselves.  In the Good Olde
Days of TeeVee, the new season (remember when there WAS a "Fall season?")
began around September (in time for the November and February sweeps), and
ended around the May sweeps.  Then Summer reruns through August.  The
sweeps periods are the very competitive periods in which stations are
monitored in order to set the price they can charge for commercials.  This
is a VERY important time for the stations, and they want new product.

     We go on the air in February.  No problem hitting the May sweeps.
But the stations need new shows to also air in November.  So that means
you have to stretch 22 episodes so that you'll still have new ones come
November.  It's a pain, but that's what we're stuck with.

                                                                          jms
