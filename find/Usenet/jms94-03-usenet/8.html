6 Mar 1994<PRE>     Talia is a P5, as Lyta was in the pilot.
 
     Lyta was recalled to Earth shortly after the events of the pilot; as
was the doctor who saw Kosh.  The only two humans exposed that closely to
a Vorlon were shipped back to Earth as fast as possible (which you'll
find out in, I believe, "War Prayer").
