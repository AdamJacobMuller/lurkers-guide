<H2>Sky -- comments and other thou</H2>
18 Mar 1994<PRE>     Since I don't know how to send an individual message to this alt
section -- I can only reply to notes in my GEnie mailbox -- I would like
to pass along the following.

     Networks usually renew their shows at the end of the season, when
they've seen all the shows.  Syndication, and PTEN in particular, works
differently.  The decision on whether or not to renew will be made in
April/early May.  One factor complicating all of this is the new
Paramount network, which is grabbing up stations and available timeslots
by the bucket.  They are, apparently, making very good deals.

     Point being...if you truly enjoy Babylon 5, I would suggest that
the next two weeks would be the ideal time to write your local TV
station -- which has a *direct* say in whether or not B5 is picked up --
and tell them so.  It's kinda unfair to have to decide on a show after
only a handful of episodes, but that's the hand all the PTEN shows have
been dealt.

     Would definitely be appreciated.
