<H2>Straczynski: Racist or Cute</H2>
11 Mar 1994<PRE>     Malcolm Biggs was just a name, nothing more.  Nor should anything
more be read into it.  You're seeing something that's not there.  Lots of
people have the first name Malcolm.  I have to confess that I'm angered
at your message.  A character is named Malcolm, and you dig up a whole
context that doesn't exist and call someone a racist because of it...a
matter strictly of perception that doesn't touch reality at any point,
and here we are working very hard to be ethnically balanced, showing
primarily inter-racial relationships between our characters...I think
you owe me and this show an apology.

                                                                      jms
