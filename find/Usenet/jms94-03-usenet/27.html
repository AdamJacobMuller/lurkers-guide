<H2>B5 Character development?</H2>
15 Mar 1994<PRE>     Re: seeing more character development in TNG at this time (you cite
knowing Picard's role in the Crusher death, Riker and Troi, and that
Data and Worf were orphans).

     "We've seen nothing" you conclude in B5.

    What we've seen so far in this show: that Sinclair has a missing 24
hours during the war; that he was involved with Sakai on and off ever
since the academy, and now has a monogamous relationship with her; that
his father was a fighter pilot...that Garibaldi has been fired from the
last several jobs he's had, and has a questionable reputation, and has a
drinking problem...that Sinclair has a death wish...that Londo has three
wives and a penchant for having affairs...that Ivanova's father has just
passed away, and her mother committed suicide, and her brother was killed
in the war....

     I could go on, but I'm not sure what the point would be.

                                                                       jms
