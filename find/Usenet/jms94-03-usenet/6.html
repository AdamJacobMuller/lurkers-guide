6 Mar 1994<PRE>     Re: the glasses...whether or not I'm ever to actually get into it or
not, the Narns put a *high* premium on physical perfection.  They're not
supposed to ever indicate any weakness.  It's a matter of shame to admit
to it.  So there's not much of a market for body-aids such as eyeglasses
back there.  It's something you hide.  So some among them buy elsewhere,
as in the case of buying human glasses with the right prescription (then,
as the assassin did, hiding them from view whenever not absolutely
necessary).
