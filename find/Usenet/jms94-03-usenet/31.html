<H2>Defensive Grid</H2>
15 Mar 1994<PRE>     Rather than explain the defense grid, I think I'd prefer to let you
see it in action.  Which you will, in May, in "Signs and Portents."  Its'
one of our heaviest action episodes of this first batch.

                                                                       jms
