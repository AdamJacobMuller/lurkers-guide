22 Mar 1994<PRE>     Re: your note about tense useage in those two lines you quote...you
unfortunately got the tenses wrong in both sentences, which takes care
of the concerns you raised.

     Line #1: "He must never find out what happened."

     Line #2: "Maybe you're still inside...maybe we're BOTH still inside."

                                                                        jms
