<H2>JMS: ok on bodies, how about s</H2>
23 Mar 1994<PRE>     There is a security problem on B5, yes.  And we hope to deal with it
at some point.  It's inevitable, really; 250,000 residents, huge crates
being moved in and out every day, people going and coming...they try to
confiscate what they can, but a lot slips through.
