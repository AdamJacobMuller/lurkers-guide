<H2>Mind War (Ivanova spoil)</H2>
6 Mar 1994<PRE>     Thanks for noticing that.  Yes, it *was* very important (to me, at
least, whether or not anyone noticed it), that Ivanova was the one who
handed Talia the water, and had that brief moment with her.  For those who
understand their relationship, it adds a tiny layer; for those who don't,
because the dialogue keeps on going over it, it's not obtrusive.
