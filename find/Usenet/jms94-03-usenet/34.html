<H2>JMS:  Straightforward Question</H2>
17 Mar 1994<PRE>     There will be new episodes in April through the end of May, then a
long break of reruns, then new ones starting in September or October,
through November.  (This is because the stations need to have new eps
for the November sweeps.)

                                                                         jms
