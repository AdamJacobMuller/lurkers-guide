<H2>JMS: "Mind War" was mind blowi</H2>
14 Mar 1994<PRE>     Glad you enjoyed it.  As for Bester...no, you've got it somewhat
reversed.  We'd initially offered Walter the role of Knight Two in "Sky,"
but when his health prohibited using him, we went to Patrick McGoohan,
who loved the script, wanted to do it, but was going to be out of the
country at the time of shooting.  We then shifted Walter to "Mind War."
