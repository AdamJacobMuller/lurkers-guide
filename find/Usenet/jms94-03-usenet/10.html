<H2>JMS: Spellings, Ages, etc.</H2>
6 Mar 1994<PRE>     1) Morobuto: African philosopher and leader who united several of
the warring countries in that area under one banner; the Ghandi of his
time (2075-2124).
 
     2) The race was the Xon.
 
     3) The Third Fane of Chu'Domo.
 
     4) There weren't many takes, but there's one *GREAT* out-take on the
gag reel.
 
     5) Yes, revealing ages 1 and 2 would reveal 3.  Be patient.
 
     6) Never got around to using the t-shirt in a shot this season.  With
luck, next one....
