9 Mar 1994<PRE>     Re: the Rama discussion....I'd just like to point one and all toward
the Gerard O'Neill speculations about space habitats, which contained the
kinds of things done in B5 and Rama and many other books about rotating
space habitats.  Again, this stuff has a backing in real science.
