<H2>JMS: Ivanova Question</H2>
24 Mar 1994<PRE>     A Psi-rating comes through training and examination of a person's
skills over time.  Ivanova's mother never went through the full sequence
to get rated.  (Although they generally don't bother with P1s through
P2s, so she was at least a P3 or above, in terms of raw ability.)  A psi
rating isn't hereditary.
