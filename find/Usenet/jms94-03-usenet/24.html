<H2>Re: Straczynski: Racist or Cut</H2>
14 Mar 1994<PRE>     Perhaps you wouldn't have so many people "pounding" on you if you
avoided the tendency to run your mouth out of turn.  First you posted a
false notice from VARIETY stating that I had been fired off my own show,
and posted it on various nets as though it were the real thing.  You were
caught out in this, mumbled about being unfairly targeted, but never
showed the *least* regret over doing it.  You smeared my name, and never
once apologized.

     Nonetheless, I offered an open hand, and said "We begin again," if
you recall, figuring that everyone is owed one act of boorishness.  Then
came your current screed.  You backtracked and said that you didn't
understand the context, that you assumed wrongly...did it occur to you to
ASK FIRST?  No.  You started throwing around messages with allegations of
racism.  You didn't ask for clarification, you started screaming
"Racist."  And once it was explained to you...again, no apology, just a
mumbled comment about being confused and making assumptions.

     Have you ever considered not running your mouth for a change, not
smearing people, not spreading rumors, not calling people offensive
names?  Just because you were born with fingers doesn't mean you have to
use them at a keyboard when your brain is clearly vapor-locked.  I don't
know what problem causes you to engage in this kind of behavior, but in
future keep it far away from me.  I didn't care for your hoax, I didn't
care for your malicious rumors, I didn't care for your allegations, and
I don't much like your "poor me" act now that you've gotten your dick
caught in the door again.

     Grow up and act like a man or get the fuck out of public view,
because you're an embarrassment to anyone who considers himself a fan of
SF; the kind of person who gives the rest of us a bad name.

                                                                   jms
