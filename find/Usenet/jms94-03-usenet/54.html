24 Mar 1994<PRE>     The EA pin on the chest (stylized) is for the Earth Alliance; the
color-coded bar beneath is for division (gold is command, silver is
command staff, green is security, red is medical division, and so on),
and ranks go on the shoulders.  (Ivanova, as liaison between the
commander and the command staff, has a split bar, gold and silver.)

                                                                       jms
