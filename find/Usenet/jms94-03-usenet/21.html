<H2>JMS: Couple questions about te</H2>
12 Mar 1994<PRE>     The first question I can't answer, for story reasons.  For the
second question, we'll delve deeply into the use of telepaths in
criminal cases -- particularly their limitations -- in "The Quality of
Mercy."  Also, there was a *long* thread about this not long ago, and
I'm not sure I'm up to going through it all again...perhaps someone here
can point to where the discussion is in the archive.

                                                                       jms
