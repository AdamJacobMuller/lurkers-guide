<H2>JMS at Pasadena Con?????</H2>
16 Mar 1994<PRE>     I'm told my presentation will be at either 1 or 2 pm on Sunday,
which will be tight since I'm flying back from Houston that morning, from
receiving an award Saturday night from the Space Frontier Foundation for
Best Vision of the Future.

                                                                        jms
