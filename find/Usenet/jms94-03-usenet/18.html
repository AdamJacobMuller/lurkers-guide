<H2>G'Kar is sexy! (re Cinefantast</H2>
8 Mar 1994<PRE>     Re: G'Kar appearing in only 12 episodes this year...that's all that
his character was required for.  Prior to the season beginning, before
one word was committed to paper, I broke out all 22 stories for this
season.  (Note: in one case, D.C. Fontana walked in with a different
story than was on the agenda, which I thought was better than what I had
in mind for that slot, and used the same characters, so that worked out.)
 We determined how many episodes all the characters were needed for, and
made our deals accordingly.

     Next year, as the story escalates, the plan is to make all of our
alien ambassadors available for 22 out of 22, allowing us to be far more
flexible.
