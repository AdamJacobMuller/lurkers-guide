18 Mar 1994<PRE>     There are over 200 pages of single-spaced notes, plus individual
files with background stuff, for the full five-year span of B5.  I don't
think it's fair to set up questions unless you know the answer well in
advance.  So yes, it is all worked out.  I tried to take a fairly
Tolkein-esque approach, fleshing out as much as possible of the B5
universe, whether or not it ever gets actually used.

                                                                    jms
