<H2>And the Sky Full of Questions</H2>
15 Mar 1994<PRE>     (From memory)...we'll know on the pickup in May; TKO and Eyes are
separate scripts, by those names; we're finishing shooing 121 and about
to start 122 (episode 22); the Narn fighters came out of the local
jumpgate.

                                                                      jms
