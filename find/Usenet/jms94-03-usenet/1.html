2 Mar 1994<PRE>     Episode #5 is the two year anniversary of B5 going on-line; not
two years since the pilot movie.  It took about a year and a half to
grow to this point, and for the final of the Big 5 ambassadors, Kosh, to
arrive, completing the group.  It's now roughly six months after that,
into the new year.
