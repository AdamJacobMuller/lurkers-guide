<H2>JMS: Season structure (was Re:</H2>
31 Mar 1994<PRE>     I dunno...I really don't think of it in those terms.  There are gaps,
and we'll deal with them.  Whether or not that changes over time will
remain to be seen; certainly I'd like it.

                                                                       jms
