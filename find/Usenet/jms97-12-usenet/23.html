15 Dec 1997<PRE>Just a reminder that private email is expressly for matters of a private or
personal nature.  General questions about story, character, theme or plot
should be put forth in the public forums, so that others can benefit from the
answers and to help keep me from answering the same questions repeatedly in
private mail.  My mailbox is starting to fill up with this sort of mail, and
I'd rather not just ignore it, but rather redirect it.
