<H2>Re: JMS -Starfury Model Question</H2>
17 Dec 1997<PRE>The finished model just came in this week, with full shrink wrap, box, pieces,
everything...very nice.  There were some delays that came from our side, as we
worked to make it more authentic and more in keeping with how they look on
screen.  Revell was happy to cooperate, even if it delayed things a bit...with
the result that it's a better product.  (Among the things we asked for: to
reposition the forward guns, alter the tilt of the engines, texture under the
wings as well as on top, that sort of thing.)

Basically, I'd rather have it *right* than have it Tuesday.
