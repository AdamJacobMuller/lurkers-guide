<H2>Re: Attn JMS or TNT People: Promo Question</H2>
15 Dec 1997<PRE>If it's the one I'm thinking of...what happened was this: I never much liked
the way WB in general promoted the show, which was an all-action, no-thought
kind of approach.  Knowing TNT was going to be coming in, and not wanting to go
through the process of reinventing the wheel, I wrote up what I thought would
be a great approach to the commercials, and I made a version of it here, which
I showed at a couple of conventions, noting that this is how I'd like the show
to be promoted (showed it at Westercon, in fact).  

When I went to Atlanta to meet with the TNT folks, I brought it with me, and
showed it to them...and they loved it, and asked for copies.  What came out is
extremely similar to the structure of the one we did here...and it works great.
 It sells the overall story, the emotion, the rising and falling of
empires...all that.  They've been extremely open to our ideas and suggestions,
which is terrific.  I can't say enough good things about TNT.
