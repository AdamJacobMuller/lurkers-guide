30 Dec 1997<PRE>&gt;Is it normal for the writer/creator to have as much
&gt;input and power as you seem to?

In TV, the writer/producer is the one in charge.  The more producer-heavy a
show is, the more that gets spread around.  Certainly folks like Bochco and
Kelley are unchallenged in this respect; ditto Chris Carter . It's simply a
matter of whether or not it's sufficiently important to you that you'll fight
like hell to maintain control.
