<H2>Re: ATT JMS: First scene?</H2>
15 Dec 1997<PRE>&gt;in more than one place you talk about
&gt;B5 coming to you in a flash (in the shower! IIRC) So I have 2 questions:
&gt;
&gt;1) Will/has that scene actually make/made it into the show? or did it
&gt;"wind up on the [virtual] cutting room floor"?

It wasn't *a* scene...it was sort of a general view of the whole thing, a sense
of the overall story, where it would go, who would be it...not any one
particular scene.
