<H2>Re: ATTN JMS:  Before the break</H2>
7 Dec 1997<PRE>&gt;Can you tell us which episodes are in 1).  writing, 2).  pre-production,
&gt;3).  filming, 4).  post-production?

1) 517
2) 514
3) 513
4) 510-512 for editting, 507-509 for music and EFX.

Normally I'd be writing 518 right now, but I'm still playing catch-up after the
back and the flu hassles last month.  We're still 3 ahead, though, where most
shows the pages are landing on the stage during filming, and I'll be completely
caught-up and actually ahead after the Christmas break, which is when I'll turn
my attention to writing the 3rd TNT movie.
