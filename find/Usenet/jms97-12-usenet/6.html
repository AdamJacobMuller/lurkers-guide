<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Six Flags B5-themed attractions?</H2>
7 Dec 1997<PRE>No, no plans for any kind of B5 attraction or park.  Some folks from Vegas came
to us with an idea, but I nixed it for the same reasons I asked for the
withdrawl of the B5 shot glasses from Creation, I just don't think lining
something up with a Vegas operation is emblematic of what B5 stands for.

What we *are* working on is something still in the development stage, which is
a B5 showscan ride, the sort with the moveable seats, high-speed
high-resolution film and a high-definition big screen you find at places like
Universal Tours or elsewhere.  Here we could do something artistic, very
exciting, with a lot of extreme CGI and put  you in the middle of a big Shadow
battle on Mars, through the atmosphere of Jupiter, and ending at B5.

Heck, I'd ride that one.
