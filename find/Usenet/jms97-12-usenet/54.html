27 Dec 1997<PRE>&gt;I had the sense that a small portion of the behind-the-camera shots came
&gt;from episode shootings that haven't been aired.  Was I grossly mistaken?

No, you're correct...WB shot B-roll during other episodes in the past, and some
of that got used, and TNT sent a crew out as well to grab some stuff during the
last of season 4, including the two movies.
&gt;Have you ever considered using Andreas in a part without
&gt;makeup(ferinstance,as a close relative of a major character)?
&gt;
&gt;

Yeah, but he won't do it.
&gt;And I am assuming this promotion show was shot before T.Scroggins joined
&gt;the cast...Y/N is ok.

Yup.
