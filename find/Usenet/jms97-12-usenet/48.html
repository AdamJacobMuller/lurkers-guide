<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Attempting the Improbable (another writing question)</H2>
26 Dec 1997<PRE>&gt;On a totally
&gt;hypothetical, if you had accepted the exec producer, writer job at a
&gt;suffering show (like SeaQuest, or Space Above and Beyond,) would you
&gt;place your focus on creating quality within the individual episode, the
&gt;season, or the story-arc. Or in other words, if a show is broke, how
&gt;would you go about fixing it?

If a show doesn't work, there's only one way to fix it...and it ain't adding
battles, or arcs, or chrome...it's the characters.  Audiences will tune in to
see what happens next to the characters they care about.  If that bond ain't
there...you've got nowhere to go.  It all proceeds from character.

As for SeaQuest, about the only thing that would've helped there would've been
depth charges.
