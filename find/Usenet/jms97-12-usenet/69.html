31 Dec 1997<PRE>&gt;And it's not only that, but ALL the cartoons!
&gt;("What's that, Avenger?  Bird-Boy's in trouble?")  And NOW it seems that I'm
&gt;going to have to watch B5 every day of the week!  This new season better be
&gt;pretty good, because my family's brains are turning to mush!

Ruh-roh....
