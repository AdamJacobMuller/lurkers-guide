29 Dec 1997<PRE>&gt;My mom ordered me some stuff from the fan club for Christmas.  I got the 
&gt;ship recognition chart and the calendar and they are very cool.  She 
&gt;also got me a mebership, but never got any of the stuff from that, she 
&gt;wrote snail-mail asking about it, but hasn't gotten any response.  

Because of the christmas rush, we got the actual gift items out first, and are
getting the memberships out afterward.  We should be catching up soon.
