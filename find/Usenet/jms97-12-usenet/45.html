<H2>Re: Aargh! Screwed by WB!</H2>
23 Dec 1997<PRE>&gt;Warner Bros couldn't sell it to a nationally available station.
&gt;N-o-o-o-o-o, that would have been too easy. They had to sell it to
&gt;individual stations in the major markets. 

As I understand it, that's because the natinoal stations up there are less than
interested in general in taking syndicated American shows, and mainly want
American shows that have been on network TV (and American shows are becoming an
increasingly hard sell up there).

Translation: it ain't WB's fault.  I'm always more than happy to give them the
rap if it's deserved...this time, it ain't.
