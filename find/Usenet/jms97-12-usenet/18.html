<H2>Re: Attn JMS: The real end of the series</H2>
12 Dec 1997<PRE>&gt;Since you're on ep 517, that must mean 521 is round the corner.. so I
&gt;gotta wonder when it's gonna hit ya (and the rest of the cast and crew)
&gt;that the end of writing, end of filming, end of post-production work, etc.
&gt;is coming soon.

I dunno...on one level, I think everyone's too busy to give it much thought. 
On another, having gone through all this last season, I think to some extent
it's already been burned through, and we're past that stage now.  (Anger,
denial, depression, bargaining, acceptance - Elizabeth Kubler-Ross.)

That there's going to be another TV movie is a big help for everyone, and the
prospect of Crusade keeping our crew busy is a help to them, and WB is still
muttering about a possible feature film which is keeping everyone's spirits
up...so it's surprisingly low key and okay.
