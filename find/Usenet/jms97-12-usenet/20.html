<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Moore Watchmen question</H2>
13 Dec 1997<PRE>&gt;I've read that you're a fan of Alan Moore (along with other comic book
&gt;writers).  Can I assume that you've read  Alan Moore's "Watchmen" comic
&gt;series,
&gt;which I think was the best comic story ever?

Watchmen was bitching.  I think it redefined comics in much the same way as
Dark Knight did (though not followed up on as much, and alas too many
publishers thought that they could do DK by just getting dark and depressing
which is why a lot of them lost a lot of readers).  DK also holds up well.

&gt;Also, what other comics had an impact on you?  You pull some of your
&gt;writers from the comic medium, and you use comics for B5 storytelling.  Is
&gt;there a reason you use so many comic writers on B5(Gaiman, David)? 

I think the Miracleman series by Moore is still one of the most brilliant
things I've ever read.  I'm partial to his work, Grant Morrison, Neil Gaiman,
Peter David and a few others.  I also thought that Mage was one of the best
books around (just this week discovered that apparently it is or has been
coming out again with a new sequence, so I'm going to have to to back into the
comics store again for the first time in a while).

I loved Grendel, and some of the Grendel followups by diverse hands.  The
Aliens comics from Dark Horse are (were) great most of the time, taking the
storyline to new levels.  I enjoyed the heck out of Marvels, for the
photorealistic approach which took a mortal's eye view of superheros.  Ditto
for Uncle Sam and Kingdom Come.  And, of course, Cerebus; I think Dave Sim is
the only other person who can understand what it is to do a story of this scale
and duration.  Also enjoyed Stan Sakai's Usagi Yojimbo.

Comics are a visual, concise medium, which is why I think the writers involved
can translate so well to television.
