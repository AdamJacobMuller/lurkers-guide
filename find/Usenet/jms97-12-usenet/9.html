<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Escape from B5?</H2>
8 Dec 1997<PRE>&gt;I've noticed that a lot of artists have trouble escaping their creations
&gt;and moving on. Some like the state of affairs, others don't:
&gt;What about you? Is there life after B5, is it out of your reach, and how
&gt;do you feel about the situation?

It's my sense that B5 will be kind of the capstone to my career; I will go on
and do other things, including books, other TV projects, plays, as I've always
done...but there's no doubt that B5 will loom large in that company.  And that
doesn't bother me at all.  If it were something I was ashamed of, then yeah,
it'd be a drag.  But that ain't the situation.

I have, at last count, about 8 different TV projects out there, several
different film scripts (just finishing up another this month), which have been
optioned at one point or another, I'm working on 2 books and a stage play, none
of which have *anything* to do with B5.  Some of them will go, and some won't. 
That's the writing life, it's a mug's game.

But the goal, at the end of the day, is to have enough stuff up on the shelf so
that, when you're gone, people can wander in and take it down and say, "Oh,
this is who that person was, and this is how he saw the world."  In that light,
B5 is one heck of a big item on the shelf, and I'm perfectly happy to be
associated with it.
