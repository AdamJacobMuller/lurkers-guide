<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Your involvement with Crusade</H2>
23 Dec 1997<PRE>&gt; If Crusade is a go, what will be your involvement with the 
&gt;show compared to what you do on B5? The same? Much less?
&gt;
&gt;
I'll exec produce, same as with B5, develop the overall arc, as with B5 (though
it's not as rigorous an arc), do all the same stuff in editing, post, all the
same stuff.  About the only real difference I foresee would be my intent to
only write about half the episodes this time around; I'm looking forward to
seeing what other writers can do in the B5 universe.
