<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: B5 fans not on cable or internet</H2>
16 Dec 1997<PRE>&gt; I would
&gt;guess, however, that many B5 fans think
&gt;it is over.  Is TNT doing anything to
&gt;attact the attention of B5 fans who are
&gt;not on cable or the internet?

I know, I hear from a lot of folks who *are* on the net and who think the show
has been canceled.  All TNT can do is what they're doing, a massive print and
TV ad campaign to let folks know.  There's a ten million dollar value campaign
behind the launch on TNT, print ads, bus ads, there will be commercials on ST
and X-Files, a four-page spread in Entertainment Weekly in the next week or so,
and I've been giving a busload of press interviews lately: TV Guide, USA Today,
Chicago Tribune, others, and I'll be shlepped out to NY sometime in January to
do more press stuff.  They're dedicated to really selling this thing.
