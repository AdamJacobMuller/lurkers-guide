<H2>Re: Attn:  JMS -- Psi Corps pins</H2>
22 Dec 1997<PRE>The Psi Corps pins are in, have been in for a couple of weeks now, and they're
just gorgeous...I don't know why they haven't been added to the Emporium yet,
they should be there now or soonish.  They're absolutely the same as the ones
we use in the show, same as with the Earthforce pins.

Among the crew, so far the Psi Corps hats have turned out to be the most
popular...they're buying 'em up fast.

BTW, down the road there may be a limited edition of the Psi Corps pins signed
by Walter....
