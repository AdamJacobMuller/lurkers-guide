<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Actors and script changes</H2>
27 Dec 1997<PRE>&gt;Joe, you've mentioned this a number of times, that actors can't
&gt;change the dialog without approval.  I'm wondering whether it's
&gt;frequent for an actor to come and *ask* for a change, and whether
&gt;they tend to get the change if they ask for it, and if the changes
&gt;have made a difference.  Any memorable examples?

Yeah, in most cases, unless it's an egregious change, or one that changes the
meaning of a sentence, I usually go along with it.  It also doesn't happen very
often.  Usually they come in with a question about something if I'm setting up
a thread for the future, so they can give it the right subtext.
