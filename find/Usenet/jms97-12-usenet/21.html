<H2>Re: Attn JMS: B5 book submissions?</H2>
14 Dec 1997<PRE>&gt;Since you're riding herd on the new Babylon 5 novels
&gt;to bring them more in line with series continuity and to create mini-
&gt;arcs, is Del Rey actually accepting submissions for Babylon 5 novels,
&gt;or are you or the editors assigning your story outlines to established
&gt;writers?

At this point, I'm writing the outlines, which are being assigned to outside,
established writers.  I've already turned in the first two installments of the
first 3-volume series on the Psi Corps.
