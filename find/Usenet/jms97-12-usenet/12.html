<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Holiday celebration?</H2>
9 Dec 1997<PRE>&gt;I was just curious as to whether the cast and crew of B5 do anything to
&gt;celebrate the holidays together before breaking for Christmas?  If so,
&gt;what, party, exchange cards, etc?

Every year we give gifts to the crew, ranging from B5 jackets to fleece
sweaters to other cool stuff, and have a christmas party.

Fewer seem to survive them every year.
