<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Music..</H2>
7 Dec 1997<PRE>&gt;You seem to be interested in music, and I was wondering if you have 
&gt;ever heard the singer Lorena McKennit?
&gt;
&gt;If yes. What did you think of her? 

I'm aware of her work, and have enjoyed it.  As I've noted here before, I think
that some of the best single artist work in rock now is being done by women
artists: Meredith Brooks, Sarah Machlachlan (I think I misspelled that), Fiona
Apple, others.

Most of the good work coming from the guys these days seems to be coming from
groups...Squirrel Nut Zippers has finally crashed the mainstream, and if you
haven't checked out Cherry Poppin' Daddies, do so...it's a great mix of big
band sound with rock style lyrics (and some cover stuff) that's real nice.

I recently picked up a couple of Primus CDs and I'm still working out what I
think of them...on the one hand, there's some really interesting stuff going on
there, but it's completely weird. (Which is not a bad thing, btw.)  Their
"Professor Nutbutter's House of Treats" (especially the video) makes the hairs
on the back of my neck stand up...so I dunno...but it's interesting stuff. 
Also just picked up Sneaker Pimps, but haven't had a chance to listen to it
yet.

Because I don't have time to watch much TV or see movies, music is about the
only thing I have access to now since I can play it while I'm working.
