<H2>Re: ATTN JMS:  "In the Beginning" and the Hugo...next year?</H2>
18 Dec 1997<PRE>&gt;Just a quick question about which B5 episodes will be your
&gt;choice for the Hugo ballot ( we all know you will get several nods)
&gt;"The Face of the Enemy" would be my choice, with "Endgame" a
&gt;close second.

Both those are good, "Face" could be best, but there's also "No Surrender, No
Retreat," which gets forgotten sometimes in this.

&gt;Will "In the Beginning" be available for consideration this
&gt;year, or next year?  I'm guessing the Jan. release makes it next year,
&gt;but I'm not sure how they work things at the Hugos...

Yes, ItB will be eligible for the following year, as will Sleeping in Light,
which should make things interesting.
