&gt;Since only *you* can really give us definitive answers to these questions,
&gt;I'm hoping you'll be feeling the generousity of the season....
&gt;
&gt;1.  Did Sinclair undergo a "preliminary psi probe" as assumed by Delenn in
&gt;Peter David's novelization of In the Beginning (page 246)?

I don't have the book in front of me, but if that refers to the one after his
capture, then yes.
&gt;
&gt;2.  Is the Eartforce Academy two, three, or four years?
&gt;
It varies depending on what aspect and how far you want to go and what your
goal is, as with some divisions of Officer Training School (OTC).
