<H2>Re: ATTN: JMS  Writing quality</H2>
9 Dec 1997<PRE>&gt;Do you ever get sloppy when you're writing, especially on deadline,
&gt;late at night, etc, and when/if it does happen, what do you do about it?
&gt;
&gt;

On deadline, no, but late, when I'm tired...it can happen to anyone.  What you
have to do is take steps to be self-correcting.

For starters, I never sit down to write a scene until I've finished working it
out in my head, which usually happens well before I get to a keyboard.  So if I
hit the keyboard late, it's not a question of being creative, it's remembering
precisely what I'd thought of earlier.  (Which is why my desk is a constant
clutter of post-it notes.)  

Even so, things can slip by, which is why my pattern of writing is to start the
day's writing by going over and rewriting the last 5-10 pages I've already
written, rather than just jumping right into the next scene.  I find this helps
me find any stupid stuff that slipped in, and I get back into the swing of the
writing again.  I trim and tighten, and I'm ready to go on the next section,
while being sure that the one preceding is solid.  Which is why, when the
script is finally published in-house for production, there's very little
revision done to it because it's already been revised several times in the
writing process.
