17 Dec 1997<PRE>&gt;Has TNT's involvement
&gt;influenced your decision to go with a spinoff? 

No, the B5 story ends where it ends; I always wanted to do the follow-up story,
from the beginning, and said so...so it didn't really affect that one way or
another.

But certainly, TNT has been extremely supportive of the show, on every
imaginable level, and it's terrific.
