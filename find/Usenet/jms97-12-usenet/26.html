15 Dec 1997<PRE>Tell the other British fans they can relax; one of the ways I made sure that
neither WB nor anyone else could air Sleeping in Light was to simply not finish
it.  The shooting is done, obviously, and it's all edited together...but we
haven't even started rendering the CGI yet (no need to, and other stuff is
pressing), haven't done the audio mix, none of that.  Just a little
insurance....
