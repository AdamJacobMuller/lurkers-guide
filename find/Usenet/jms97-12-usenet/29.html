17 Dec 1997<PRE>A studio can influence the direction of any TV series, and its writers, by
bouncing scripts that they don't like, by telling the producers what direction
to take the show...they can influence the tone, the kinds of stories told (safe
vs. controversial) because it's their money, and their show.
