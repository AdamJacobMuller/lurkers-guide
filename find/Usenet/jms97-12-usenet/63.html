<H2>Re: JMS' ego trip</H2>
30 Dec 1997<PRE>Point one: I had absolutely nothing to do with the content of the Guide except
to review some of Bruce's on-camera narration for fact-checking purposes.  I
didn't see it until it was done.

Point two: "now I have to go to all the trouble of either buying illegal
drugs...or become a serial killer."

Wouldn't you find either option redundent?
