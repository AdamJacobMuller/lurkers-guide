<H2>Re: Attn JMS: Speaking at ICON 98</H2>
29 Dec 1997<PRE>&gt;The people at ICON say you weren't invited this spring because they don't
&gt;like to have the same speakers two years in a row.

Which is perfectly understandable; I didn't say there was anything amiss in not
being invited.  Someone asked why I wasn't going to be there, and that was the
answer.  I wouldn't expect them to invite the same folks two years running.

&gt;But what really got my attention was the fact that they're going to have
&gt;Claudia Christian instead. Is she going to be representing the show?
&gt;Because if she isn't, you should know that this is the impression the
&gt;ICON people are giving.

Claudia is certainly capable of representing and discussing her experiences and
time on the first 4 years of the show.
