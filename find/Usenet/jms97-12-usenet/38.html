<H2>Re: ATTN JMS:  When do you feel most at home?</H2>
22 Dec 1997<PRE>&gt;When do you feel most at home during the creative process of
&gt;the show?
&gt;	Is it on the set...getting your hands dirty...actually seeing
&gt;your vision come to life?
&gt;	Or is it while you are writing...actually giving such
&gt;wonderful life to the characters that inhabit that vision?

First and foremost, I'm a writer.  That's not just what I do, it's who and what
I *am*.  So of all the things I do, that's when I'm most in my element.  John
Flinn can beat me on stage in composing a shot, John Copeland can configure a
fight scene better in editing than I can (most days), Chris Franke can come up
with touches in music that I would never think of...

But behind the keyboard, nobody can touch me.  (Hmm...I wonder what my
subconscious would make of that statement; I think I just said more than I
wanted to.)  

Anyway...this is where I'm at home.  My goal is real simple: to write better
than anyone who can write faster than me, and faster than anyone who can write
better than me.
