<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Likelihood of CC guest appearance in S5?</H2>
25 Jul 1997<PRE>I don't think it's a matter of reconciliation, though a number of folks in
the cast are more than a bit upset with her decision.  But that aside....

In fifth year terms, given the situation, and contractual problems in
bringing a departed regular in to guest star...my guess is that the odds
are slim and none.  It'll almost certainly have to wait for either the
third TNT movie or feature projects.
