<H2>JMS or anyone else on B5 unifo</H2>
22 Apr 1994<PRE>     Yes and no.  All Earthforce uniforms in this division are blue; EA
marines are olive/brown; security and other NCO areas get grey.  Within
those areas, it's further subdivided, and is distinguishable by the
horizontal bars below the EA insignia.  Gold is command; silver is for
command staff.  (Ivanova, being in between, has a divided bar, half gold
and half silver.)  Red is medical, green is security.  Yellow is for
science division.  The rank bars are on the shoulder.
