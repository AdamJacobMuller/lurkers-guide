22 Apr 1994<PRE>     Re: the relationship between these two, and your statement that, in
looking at the characters of Garibaldi and Talia, the relationship "seems
so contrived...."

     Errr....I don't know how to tell you this, but this wasn't referring
to a relationship between the *characters*, but to one between the
ACTORS.  Jerry and Andrea are, shall we say, very much involved.  That
will not bleed into their characters.

     Is this, perhaps, a shade *less* contrived...?

                                                                        jms
