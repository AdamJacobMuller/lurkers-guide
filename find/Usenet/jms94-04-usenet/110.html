<H2>JMS: Black Omega Starfury Ques</H2>
30 Apr 1994<PRE>     Black Omega Starfuries are *hideously* expensive, rather like
Stealth Bombers.  They have to be carefully maintained, and their
existence isn't generally trumpeted.  (Like the Aurora, for instance.)
They're not mainly a defensive system, but rather an infiltration unit
used on black projects/covert missions.  They're not really meant for an
operation like B5.
