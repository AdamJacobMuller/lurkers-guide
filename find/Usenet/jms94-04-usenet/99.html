27 Apr 1994<PRE>     "Where are the children of Babylon 5?"

     Where are the children of Los Angeles International Airport?

     Answer: going and coming, but not generally staying for any period
of time.  B5 is like a massive airport or airport/hotel complex.  The
only people who generally LIVE there are those who WORK there; everybody
else is going or coming.  It's not a place you'd bring kids (remember what
happened to the LAST Babylon stations).

     As it is, a kid -- adolescent -- appears in three stories this
season: Purple, Believers, and Legacies...and that's at least two more
than I'm comfortable with.
