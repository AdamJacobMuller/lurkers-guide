<H2>DiTillio, GURPS, P5</H2>
25 Apr 1994<PRE>     You're grasping at straws.  If you take the full extent of what a
telepath can do, split it in half, and you'll get what a lot of folks
would consider a mid-ground, or a 5.  I've never read anything from
GURPS.

     As for Larry...he did the Grey Knight RPG, and co-wrote the Call
of Cthulhu, and wrote Masks of Nyarlathotep, among others.
