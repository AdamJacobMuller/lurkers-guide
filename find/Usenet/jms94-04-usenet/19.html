<H2>Psy-Core</H2>
7 Apr 1994<PRE>    The Psi Corps doesn't exist just to help telepaths avoid infringing
on the privacy of others.  They service the business community, the
military, some other governmental agencies...it's important that they
control, regulate, and profit from telepaths.  You can't just leave the
corps.
