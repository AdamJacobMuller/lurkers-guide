<H2>JMS: DeathWalker questions (mi</H2>
21 Apr 1994<PRE>     The Dilgar War was one of the first conflicts that the EA got into,
soon after establishing a presence in space.  We mainly entered it to
try and make a "rep" for ourselves, then got more morally involved when we
saw what was going on.  That and the Minbari War are the only real major
conflicts Earth has been involved with, and Earth was not directly at risk
in the Dilgar war, though if they hadn't been stopped, that might have
changed eventually.
