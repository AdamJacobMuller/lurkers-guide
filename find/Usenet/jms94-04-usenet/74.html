<H2>Why Babylon?</H2>
22 Apr 1994<PRE>     Ancient Babylon kind of began with a good idea, to form a central
location for business, commerce, trading...and gradually went downhill
from there.  The *idea* was solid, and that was the goal of the Babylon
project...to form a place, a freeport, of trading, where cultures could
come together.  And it sounded exotic.  Naturally, no one expects Babylon
5 to go the way of the original Babylon....

     After all, we're *so* much smarter now.
