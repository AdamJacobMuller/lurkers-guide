1 Apr 1994<PRE>     Yeah, I'd say if you're looking for some cool CGI, you'll see it in
"Signs."  I'd say overall that our most effects-heavy episodes are "Signs,"
"Babylon Squared," "A Voice in the Wilderness" parts 1 and 2, and maybe
"Chrysalis."  The first three in particular are real blow-outs.
