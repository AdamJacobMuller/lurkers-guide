28 Apr 1994<PRE>     "The concept of loving parents being able to kill their child for
their religions seems to be unrealistic."

     Funny...I seem to recall this little story in the Old Testament
about how a good and wise man was asked by god to sacrifice his own son,
to himself kill his own child, and he was willing to do it, and was only
stopped by god saying, in essence, "April fool."

                                                                      jms
