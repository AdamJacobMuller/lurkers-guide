<H2>Re: Poll: Sexiest B5 character</H2>
23 Apr 1994<PRE>     I have spoken today to Andreas Katsulas regarding the charges you
raise, and he was unaware of any charges being pressed until he today
called and spoke with the officer in charge.  He does not have any such
problem as you describe, and is taking action.  Your statement that he
"chose to let it lay" is untrue because he was unaware of it.  It is my
understanding, through him, that you have called his home, tracked down
his employment (as indicated by your own message concerning his agents),
and have engaged in all the behavior typical of stalkers.  You are in the
process of defaming and libeling Andreas, and I urge you to stop now while
you can.  Lawyers are now being called into the situation, and a report
containing all of your behavior on this issue, particularly your printed
statements here, is being filed with LA police.

     The kind of person who comes on line and makes allegations such as
this -- and a charge filed by someone proves *nothing*, by the way, only
that the person involved chose to do so, as with the recent filing of
assault charges by Roseanne, which she has now retracted saying that she
was "just upset" -- is the lowest form of human being, who must find some
way to strike out at someone.  If you've got a case, make it, otherwise
shut up.

     This is the kind of thing that most dismays me about the nets, the
way in which one person can get on and use them to try and destroy another
person's career, personal life and reputation.

                                                                       jms
