<H2>Save The Universe In 60 Minute</H2>
8 Apr 1994<PRE>     Let me dive in and take issue with you.  The problem you seem to
have with the show(s) is alas a part of basic dramatic structure.  You
have an introduction, a rising action, a climax, and then a denouement.
Aside from experimental theater kinds of things, that is the basic
underlying structure to all movies, plays and television series.

     "Twin Peaks," which you cite, really isn't a very good example
because, in my view, TP *never* resolved ANYthing.  Thus it became an
exercise in viewer frustration that eventually was a major reason why the
show was canceled.

     The first batch of B5 episodes tended to be a little more self
contained because, remember, we're trying to bring viewers in here, and
do so without startling or pissing them off.  We get a little funkier the
deeper into the show we get.  In some cases, as with "Sky," parts of the
story are resolved, parts aren't.  Generally, it's our feeling that if
you have an open-ended B story, you generally have to include an A story
that has some measure of closure.

     "Signs and Portents" and "Babylon Squared" are two episodes offhand
that I think are emblematic of what you're asking for.  The A story in
"Signs" is resolved...but that episode really isn't *about* the A story,
it's about something unusual that happens with the B story that begins to
set a lot of things in motion for this season.  And that story is ended,
but not *resolved*, if you get the distinction.

                                                                      jms
