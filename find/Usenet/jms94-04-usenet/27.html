<H2>Could I build a space craft?</H2>
8 Apr 1994<PRE>      Alas, as much fun as this might be, can't be done.  It all has to do
with the development process, which must be work for hire, in order to be
owned properly by PTEN.  Ron's designs must be developed while under
contract, not purchased or used later.  And he provides them exclusively.
It's a real knotty situation, and frankly, a pain in the butt....
