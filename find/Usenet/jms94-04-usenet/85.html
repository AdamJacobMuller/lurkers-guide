24 Apr 1994<PRE>     Okay, but then you're going to have an actor trying to emote in
scenes with an air-breathing octopus.  It's going to look *silly* because
the tech doesn't exist to make it look REALLY good.  There are some things
that work in fiction, and some things that won't work when you have to
FILM them.  This is one of them.

                                                                        jms
