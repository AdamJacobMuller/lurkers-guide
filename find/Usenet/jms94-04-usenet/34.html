<H2>RE: B5 merchandise</H2>
11 Apr 1994<PRE>     Thanks for the comments on the show.  On the CD-Rom, more than a
"making of" product, which is of course part of it, what I want to do is
use it to help de-mystify TV production.  There's an awful lot of
mythology about how things are done, and if we can help dispell some of
that, all the better.  We've come up with some very nifty and innovative
interactive stuff for it that'll help that process.  It'll also have
extensive sections on the aliens, their homeworlds, cultures, language,
music, future Earth history (between now and 2258)...a substantial guide
to the B5 universe itself.  Hell, *I* want a copy....

                                                                   jms
