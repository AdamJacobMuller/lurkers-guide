9 Apr 1994<PRE>     "JMS reminds me a little of Kosh...or is it the other way around?"

     If it helps, bear in mind in which brain Kosh was *created*, and where
he resides in off-hours, in this big circle running around in my skull
with Delenn, Kosh, G'Kar and Londo chasing one another endlessly, like
white mice in a wheel....
