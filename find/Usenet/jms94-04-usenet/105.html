<H2>Re: JMS: Appreciative Viewer</H2>
28 Apr 1994<PRE>     It was important to tell David to pull no punches because in TV,
most producers *want* you to do so, and he had to know going in that this
was the way the story would go.  David's a great writer, and David's a
professional...meaning he understands where the general limits of TV are.
If you're going to move the lines around, it behooves you to tell your
writer that.  Knowing the rules, he went out and did a bangup job on the
episode.
