<H2>B5 merchandise</H2>
8 Apr 1994<PRE>     I decided early on to take the same approach on marketing B5 as
was taken with Calvin and Hobbes (my favorite strip) by its creator: do
either nothing or as little as possible for the first period of the
show.  Don't become merchandise driven.  Concentrate on the story, on
doing your *job* right, then later worry about the fringes.  So I've been
dragging my feet on this.  But if and when we get picked up, I'll likely
expedite this a bit.  The main one that has been approved so far has been
Compton's CD Rom of the B5 universe, mainly because I can also see a lot
of educational use in that one, how a show is made and how you create an
SF universe, which makes it an exception in my view.
