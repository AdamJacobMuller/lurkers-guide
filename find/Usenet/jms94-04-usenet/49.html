<H2>The Starfuries aren't new...</H2>
19 Apr 1994<PRE>     Your message is correct; there are various "weights" of Starfuries,
some much more massive and impressive.  The ones on B5 are light, fast,
not overly complicated, and quick-strike machines.  Another kind, which
you'll see in the two-parter, has cockpits fore *and* aft, a two-person
ship with much heavier shielding and armaments; the "Black Omega" version
is made for top speed as an interceptor with advanced stealth components.

                                                                         jms
