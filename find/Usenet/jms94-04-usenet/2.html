<H2>DS9 vs B5 question</H2>
1 Apr 1994<PRE>     Babylon 5 was conceived in 1986; the screenplay for the pilot (which
was more or less what was shot) was written in 1987.  Also in 1987, art
was commissioned and used to help in pitches to networks and studios.  The
full project -- artwork, screenplay, series bible, treatment and sample
stories -- was shopped to several places, including Paramount in 1989.  As
for the rest...ehhhh.  Old news.  And the show stands on its own, which is
the important thing.
