<H2>JMS Questions: God &amp; Schedules</H2>
19 Apr 1994<PRE>     The post to which you refer is correct; I'm an atheist.  But as part
of that comes the attitude that, if I want my position respected, I must
respect the position of others, and the fact that the religious impulse is
a sincere part of the human race's attempt to understand itself.

     And I wouldn't mind seeing some Hill Street folks making a trip
through B5 sometime, either....
