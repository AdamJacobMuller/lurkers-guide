<H2>"Off the scale"</H2>
8 Apr 1994<PRE>     The other thing on "off the scale," of course, is that meters do have
a finite end-point beyond which they're fairly useless, at least on the
level a tech would have.  You design a system for what you're likely to
encounter, plus some extra.  And some of the stuff they encounter is just
beyond the parameters of that equipment.  Some of it is for dramatic
impact, of course, but that was my reasoning, such as it is.

                                                                      jms
