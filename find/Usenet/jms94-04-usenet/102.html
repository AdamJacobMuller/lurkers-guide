<H2>JMS: Why Vorlons on B5?</H2>
28 Apr 1994<PRE>     The Vorlons are the great unknown.  They occupy a *huge* sector of
space.  No expedition ever sent to Vorlon space has ever returned, or
sent back word.  No human had ever even *seen* a Vorlon prior to Kosh's
arrival on B5.  Their technology is vastly superior to just about everyone
else's.  To unravel the mystery, to maybe get a *piece* of their tech, is
more than sufficient inducement, I'd think.
