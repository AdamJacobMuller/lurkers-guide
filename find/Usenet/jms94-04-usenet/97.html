<H2>JMS: Doesn`t this get tir</H2>
26 Apr 1994<PRE>     "Are there any other print or comic writing credits we should know
about?"

     Yikes....

     There's an *awful* lot out there, in one form or another, most of it
in the area of journalism.  Something over 500 published articles, in
VIDEO REVIEW, SAN DIEGO MAGAZINE, L.A. READER, PENTHOUSE, WRITER'S DIGEST,
THE L.A. TIMES, TIME INC., way too many to list.  The fiction's a bit
easier.  "Your Move," in Amazing Stories Magazine, my first published
short story (that counts anyway); "A Last Testament for Nick and the
Trooper," in Shadows 6; "Say Hello, Mister Quigley," in both Pulphouse and
the Midnight Grafitti anthology; "Demon Night" and "OtherSyde," both
novels from St. Martin (hardcover); the TZ comic, plus an issue of Teen
Titans Spotlight: On Cyborg (Cyborg vs. Two Face) "Face to Face Two Face,"
and an issue of the Star Trek comic, "Worldsinger."  Also a collection,
"Tales from the New Twilight Zone."  And others.  But those are the
highlights.
