28 Apr 1994<PRE>     To: Carroll, Patrick C.

     Glad you could join our little group.  I'm glad to see you here.  It
proves that the prison work programs are indeed capable of some measure of
rehabilitation.  Just keep on the lithium, and jump in whenever you like.

     I look forward to it.

                                                                     jms
