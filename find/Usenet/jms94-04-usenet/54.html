<H2>JMS: Autographs'n'Photos</H2>
19 Apr 1994<PRE>     Actually, at this time, there *is* no office handling autographs,
photos or scripts.  We really aren't doing any of that at this time.  If
there is a second season, we might set up an office to handle some of
this, but we'll have to wait and see...sorry this wasn't a more positive
reply.
