<H2>Newbie Question....</H2>
11 Apr 1994<PRE>     The sector of space was chosen for B5 because a) it's pretty much
in neutral territory, and b) of the neutral territory areas, this is the
one that seems to have nothing of value in it, so nobody will be
interested in fighting over what's there.  This may not necessariliy be
true in the future.

     The interior of the station does have some farm-land, orchards, an
open-air hedge maze, and other green areas.  We'll be seeing them in
varying degrees of detail throughout the series.  No specs are yet
publicly available.
