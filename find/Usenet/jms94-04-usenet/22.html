<H2>babylon 4</H2>
7 Apr 1994<PRE>     No commander had yet been assigned to Babylon 4.  One Major Krantz
had been assigned to oversee the final stages of construction, and was on
board -- along with about 1300 others in the construction crew -- when
the station vanished.  The station had only been on-line 24 hours, and the
discussions of a commanding officer had just begun when it disappeared.
