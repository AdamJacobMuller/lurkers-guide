<H2>Deathwalker: SPOILERS and obse</H2>
24 Apr 1994<PRE>     Your statement about the serum being a means of getting to the truth
-- or her truth at the very least -- is quite correct.  And appropos to
current reality.  We look back at the Nazis, and others, and say, "Well,
WE could never do that."  But of course we could.  Fine tune your
attention to the frequency of misery and inhumanity, and in short order
you'll pick up Rwanda, and Bosnia and a host of others.

     Our capacity for greatness is as substantial as our capacity for
evil.  And we must constantly be reminded of that duality; to pretend
it simply isn't there, or is somebody else's problem, inevitably leads to
tragedy.  (For those interested, btw, I would encourage you to check out
a short story by Mark Twain, called "The Man
Who Corrupted Hadleyburg."  I think you will find it *most* illuminating.)

                                                                   jms
