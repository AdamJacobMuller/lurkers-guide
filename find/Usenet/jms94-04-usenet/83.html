23 Apr 1994<PRE>     Except of course that Sinclair said that the non-aligned worlds would
have observers there at all times...there are no other Dilgar to help
break her out...the Narns have no desire to attack Earth installations to
break her out as long as they get their share of the serum...and there
really was no other alternative short of war.
