<H2>Centauris, Narns, and Earth: q</H2>
3 Apr 1994<PRE>     The Centauri never really got around to us.  They've been in a
decline for a long time; the Narn occupation was one of the last of their
imperialist rampages.  Now they're pulling back further and further.  And
also as re: Earth...space is big.  100 years ago, we weren't putting out
any radio or television or microwave transmissions; they can't check EVERY
planet.  We got overlooked for a long time by lots of different groups.

     Re: weapons...the Narns got their hands on the Centauri leftover
weapons, and the manufacturing systems put in place there during the
occupation that nearly strip-mined their world.  Using that as a base,
they got heavily into the weapons business, and continue to do so.
