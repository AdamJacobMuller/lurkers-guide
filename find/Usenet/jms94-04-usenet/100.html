<H2>Re: Enough White Man's SciFi..</H2>
28 Apr 1994<PRE>     And of course there still *are* conflicts between Earth countries
at the time of B5.  Including conflicts over space.  In a news broadcast
featured prominently in the upcoming two-parter, because of another item
in the broadcast that's important for that episode, it's noted that the
representatives in Earthdome from several countries have pulled out in
protest on the grounds that since they do not benefit equally from the
exploitation of space, they should not be expected or required to help
pay for it on an equal basis as everyone else.
