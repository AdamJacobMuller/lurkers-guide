<H2>About Creative Stories for B5</H2>
3 Apr 1994<PRE>     The best solution I've seen offered here is to create a *mailing list*
rather than a newsgroup for the exchange of this stuff.  That guarantees
the users some measure of privacy.

                                                                       jms
