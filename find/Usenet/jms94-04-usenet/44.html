12 Apr 1994<PRE>     And of course, if I said I would lie, who's to say I was telling the
truth when I said I would lie?  I might've been lying about lying; why
should I tell the truth about that?  Or this?  Or perhaps I'm being
totally truthful, in which case I will cop to admitting being untruthful
in this eventuality.

     I need a vacation.
