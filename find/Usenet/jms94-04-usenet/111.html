30 Apr 1994<PRE>     Through a miscommunication, Warners thought TKO was in the slot in
which we'd placed Quality, so that went out to TV Guide, and it's now
too late to change the order back.  Doesn't matter; neither are really
arc-stories, though it was hoped to hold back some of Susan's development
in TKO just a tad longer.
