<H2>Katsulas, was Re: Poll: Sexies</H2>
23 Apr 1994<PRE>     Let me just dive in on this.  I hadn't really been following this
thread, and only learned of the ugly direction this had taken when I got
a call today from Andreas.  He was hurt, and angry, and confused.  The
incident in question, he emphasized, *never happened*.  He also indicated
that he had received harrassing phone calls from one party involved, and
that he had spoken with the police department where the "report" was
filed, and that they consider it of dubious origin.

     This discussion, and the allegations, are clear libel, and it's
dismaying to see people taking up libel and innuendo without *any*
background whatsoever.  This is an ugly thing that happens on the 'nets
from time to time, sometimes from people who are disturbed, or want
attention, or have an agenda.  One person, for instance, spread the rumor
on the nets that I had been fired from B5 after the pilot; another put
out a rumor that I was a coke fiend, when in fact I don't drink, don't
smoke, don't do drugs, don't do *anything.*  The problem becomes that one
person can log on here, make an irresponsible or untrue allegation, other
people pick it up, and suddenly it's all over the place, and it becomes
self-reinforcing.

     Let me be clear: I have worked with Andreas for two years.  I have
seen him at conventions, seen him with women, and he has never been
ANYthing but polite and careful to treat EVERYONE well.  There has never
been a single other complaint raised about him, from anywhere.  He is a
gentleman of the old school.

     Police here on the West Coast are being alerted to this problem, to
the harrassing/stalking-like phone calls, and lawyers are being brought
into the equation.  This is one of the dangers in gaining some measure of
notoriety; one becomes a target.

     I ask *all* of you to stop this thread at once.  It's untrue, and
damaging, and libelous.  This will be dealt with by Andreas,  officially,
and that will take care of it.  You are judging and condemning a good,
decent man who has done nothing deserving of that.  This is an ugly
example of rumor-mongering, character assassination, libel and probably
verges on stalking.  Everyone...stay OUT of this, and let the legal
process take care of itself.

                                                                      jms
