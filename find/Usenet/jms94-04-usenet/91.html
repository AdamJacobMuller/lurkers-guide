<H2>The Garden</H2>
25 Apr 1994<PRE>     There is some limited life within the garden...some birds (which
you can hear sometimes), and insects, and the like.  (In one shot you
can see an insect fly off one of our actors.  Yeah, sure, like we
planned that....)  It's generally one season in the Garden, and plants
requiring variation are raised in a separate hydroponics area, such as
the orchard (seen in "War Prayer").
