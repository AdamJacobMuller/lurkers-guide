<H2>ATTN JMS: Vir and Londo (small</H2>
17 Nov 1994<PRE>     Be assured, Vir's position continues to be important, and he moves a
bit closer to the limelight as he does so...remember, he's the one who
has to watch Londo's actions like a man watching an accident in slow
motion, and try to do what he can to stop it.
