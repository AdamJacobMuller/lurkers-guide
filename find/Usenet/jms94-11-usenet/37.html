<H2>CHRYSALIS, blooper? (SPOILER)</H2>
9 Nov 1994<PRE>     Sorry, this isn't a blooper.  Garibaldi says, into the Link,
"Garibaldi to Sinclair," which tells the Link to find Sinclair.  Then we
have Sinclair's response.  No blooper.

                                                                          jms
