<H2>Historical models for B5 empir</H2>
18 Nov 1994<PRE>     Certainly, when I sat down to construct Minbari society, I looked
into various historical models, and overall, though there are bits and
pieces of one or another, I tried not to model it after any one group
wholecloth.  Certainly there's allegory all over the place....
