<H2>ATTN JMS: New Officer's Lounge</H2>
9 Nov 1994<PRE>     Basically, I decided to name the EA Lounge "Earhart's" because she
is an important figure in aviation history, and I wanted a 40s art deco
style to the place, down to big band music, and it fit perfectly.  There
have been more women aviators, civilian and elsewhere, than we know,
particularly during WW II at home, and they deserve recognition.
