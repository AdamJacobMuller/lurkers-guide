12 Nov 1994<PRE>     Re: inconsistent writing and Narns...please bear in mind that there
are two ways to encounter shadowmen: going out there, and them coming in
to see YOU.  The Narns need not be (and were not) spacefaring when they
encountered the shadowmen.  Or, more accurately, were encountered BY them.
