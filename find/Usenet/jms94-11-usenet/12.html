<H2>JMS (and others): Babylon 5 co</H2>
3 Nov 1994<PRE>     By the time B5 hits the UK, only the first 2 issues of the comic
should be out, and there's nothing in any of those that could be
considered a spoiler, so you should be okay.

                                                                       jms
