<H2>Underwriting + Underacting = Q</H2>
13 Nov 1994<PRE>     "Whoever wrote 'Points of Departure.'"

     That would be me.  The first three ("Points," "Revelations" and "the
Geometry of Shadows") are mine.  The next three are by D.C. Fontana ("A
Distant Star," Scott Frost "The Long Dark," and Larry DiTillio ("A Spider
in the Web"), with Peter David's "Soul Mates" rounding out the first
seven new eps to be broadcast in a row.

     We then hit late December, and reruns through the Christmas
holidays when nobody's home.  We'll come back then with "A Race Through
Dark Places" (jms); "The Coming of Shadows" (jms); "GROPOS" (ld); "All
Alone in the Night" (jms); "Acts of Sacrifice" (jms), then some more
freelance scripts.

                                                                    jms
