<H2>DUMB SCREW-UPS</H2>
13 Nov 1994<PRE>     She's not seeing the shooter from outside Garibaldi's POV.  That
shot in particular is *exactly* from Garibaldi's POV.  It's a lot like
what is done in hypnosis, going back into somebody's memory and dragging
out details they might have seen but not noted; the eye sees more than
the brain recalls at any given moment.  When we shot that scene, I was
on-set, and the camera was put *exactly* where Garibaldi was standing,
so we'd be very careful that it WAS his point of view.  So though I hate
to contradict you, it's not "a stupid plot hole from hell."
