<H2>GoS costumes (no spoilers)</H2>
18 Nov 1994<PRE>     Ann Bruice did a great job on the technomage costumes; I agree.  She
found ways to implement what was described in the script that were both
creative and wore well, and fulfilled the function.  I wanted black, with
fine silver lines, and an almost circuitboard look to the patterns in
places, but not *obviously* that, stylized.  She took that and came back
with a true niftyness....
