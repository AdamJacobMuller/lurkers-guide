<H2>Re: USA TODAY and the Truth ab</H2>
1 Nov 1994<PRE>     Someone should point out to Ford the article appearing this week
(out in many newspapers already) for the Tribune Syndicate, in which she
states that, based on her interviews and sources, it WAS a mutual and
amicable parting, that Sinclair is NOT gone, and basically reinforces every
single point made here.

     Assuming anyone really cares anymore...frankly, I'm getting pretty
fucking tired and disgusted with the whole discussion.  Ford is an idiot,
pure and simple.

                                                                   jms
