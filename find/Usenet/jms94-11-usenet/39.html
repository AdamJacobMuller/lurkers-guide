<H2>JMS! HELP! RE: B5 -Capt Power</H2>
9 Nov 1994<PRE>     I had very little to do with Captain Power after walking off the
show because I thought there was too much power being given to the
merchandising aspect.  And I'm not sure how much to reveal; I can say
that Larry DiTillio, who came in after me as story editor, edited an
entire season worth of scripts; 24 scripts are lying around, waiting to
be filmed.  I kinda gave him the elements I wanted to see dealt with, and
left.  (I seem to remember a Starlog interview with Larry a couple of
years back where the arc is pretty much spelled out for year two.)

                                                                     jms
