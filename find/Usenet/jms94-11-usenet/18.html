<H2>Re: USA TODAY and the Truth ab</H2>
4 Nov 1994<PRE>     This to Ken Schroder...a very good analysis of the situation re:
Sinclair/Sheridan.  One other element, which will become clearer with
the passage of time, is that Sinclair's main tie was to the Minbari
storyline, which though not *resolved* per se in "Points," gets pushed
back as the Shadowmen story advances.  So his impact on that storyline
would have been second-hand.  Sheridan, on the other hand, has a direct
tie-in to this latter storyline, though he does not know it yet.  Also,
there are some military aspects coming that only someone commanding a
starship recently, and working with some other aspects of the military,
would have access to, and that is also something Sheridan brings to the
story.
