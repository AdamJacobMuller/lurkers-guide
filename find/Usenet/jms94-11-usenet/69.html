<H2>Why is B5 syndicated?</H2>
16 Nov 1994<PRE>     Real simple, non-tech answer: none of the networks wanted it.  They
didn't think it could be contained and shot for a budget; they didn't
think there was an audience for SF space stuff outside Star Trek (and many
still don't); they didn't think the EFX could be done using CGI.  Every
single one of them passed on it on the grounds that it couldn't be done.
