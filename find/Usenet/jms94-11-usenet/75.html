<H2>Geometry of Shadows [SPOILER]</H2>
17 Nov 1994<PRE>     You hit on the head *precisely*.  When Garibaldi was popping the
energy cap in and out of the PPG, he was on the floor, nominally in the
dark, thinking of killing himself.  I didn't want to play it up, didn't
want to make it what the story was about...just show him doing it, over and
over.  And from Sheridan's face, seeing the last of this, it's clear he
got it...and I thought he handled the scene *perfectly*, by his whole
demeanor, but NOT talking about it except indirectly.

                                                                         jms
