<H2>ATT JMS &amp; PAD:  (Re: Ignore Fo</H2>
1 Nov 1994<PRE>     The idea of, "ask a member of the WGA" why one should never trust a
television producer is moronic in the extreme, because for the most part,
the majority of producers in TV ****ARE WRITERS**** and members of the
WGA.  I've been a member of WGA since 1978 or so, and have been a writer
a lot longer than I've been a producer.
