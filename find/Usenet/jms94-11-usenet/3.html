<H2>Re: Bab 5 in USA Today</H2>
1 Nov 1994<PRE>     *sigh*...I was up writing all night long, I meant to say that the
Tribune Syndicate and TV Guide got the story more accurately than USA
Today in that one respect (though the rest of the article seemed fine);
unlike Ford, I have a life, and sometimes it gets tiring.
