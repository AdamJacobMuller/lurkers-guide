<H2>B5's music</H2>
6 Nov 1994<PRE>     Christopher writes the B5 music here; faxes it to Berlin, and the
Berlin Symphonic Film Orchestra, which he works with.  The next day, he
gets on a high-compression audio/video link (via phone and fiber optic
lines) and conducts the orchestra in Berlin from his home here in LA.  The
finished music is then sent here via those same high-compression lines,
and transferred to DAT.  In some cases, if we need something fast, and
it's fairly simple, he does it on his studio equipment.
