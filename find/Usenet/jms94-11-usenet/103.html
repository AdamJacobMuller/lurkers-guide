<H2>JMS: No ST style Technobabble</H2>
29 Nov 1994<PRE>     So many questions about hyperspace came up over the last year or so
that we figured they should be addressed; be assured, we're staying as
clear of technobabble as ever, despite my Spousal Overunit's absolute
and unshakeable conviction that *everything* is, at its root, a math
problem.
