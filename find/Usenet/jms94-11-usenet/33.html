<H2>Sheridan didn't tell Clark !!!</H2>
7 Nov 1994<PRE>     This is correct.  Sheridan did NOT tell President Clark about the
Minbari soul situation.  Clark already knew about it.  Sheridan's line
is, "I spoke with the president.  He is the only other person who knows
why the Minbari surrendered."  Also, in the first issue of the comic, this
prior knowledge on Clark's part is clear as well.
