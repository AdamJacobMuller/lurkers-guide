<H2>Dear JMS-Question?</H2>
12 Nov 1994<PRE>     I tried to develop a basic language structure for each of the races
on B5.  There are certain commonalities to the structure of names.  I
came up with some prefixes and suffixes, and assigned meanings to them,
the same as real names.  For instance, Rathenn (referred to by Delenn in
"Voices") and Delenn have the same suffix, which has a specific meaning.
You can break it down; Ner-oon (Legacies), Del-enn, Rath-enn, Der-onn, and
so forth.  The various parts do have specific meanings, but I generally
keep that to myself, just for amusement.

     No Irish ancestry here that I'm aware of.

                                                                        jms
