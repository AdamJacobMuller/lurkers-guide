<H2>ATT JMS! How can we help "save</H2>
17 Nov 1994<PRE>     The best thing to do, really, is to a) let the stations know, in
writing, that you like the show, and why, and b) keep bringing in others
to discover the show.  Near as I can tell, most of the new viewers we're
now getting are coming not through ads or promos, but word of mouth.
