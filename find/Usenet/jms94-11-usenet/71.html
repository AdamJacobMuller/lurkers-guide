<H2>JMS: Utility Actor????</H2>
17 Nov 1994<PRE>     In order to create more involved alien makeups, and because many
actors have a hard time with prosthetics, we created what we call the
Babylon 5 Alien Rep Group; last year about five, and this year about 12
actors who we have taken full head and (in some cases) body casts, so we
can use them in mid-level speaking roles as aliens and rotate them in and
out.  Since we had fewer last year, you saw Mark more than you'll see him
this year.  Green Drazi #1 in "Geometry" is one such rep group alien.

     We keep trying to find interesting solutions to interesting problems.
