<H2>Too much net influence?</H2>
12 Nov 1994<PRE>     My sense has always been that no one hanging thread should be allowed
to hang more than one season.  And all information needed to understand
any thread must be included in the episode.

     When I work here on the nets with notes about foreshadowing, it's
basically to play and allow some folks to start to figure out stuff before
it happens.  This is something that, from talking to many non-netted
viewers, the regular audience member doesn't really try to do.  The
emphasis in the minds of most viewers is tuning in to see what happened.
The emphasis here on the nets is to try and figure out what's going to
happen BEFORE it happens.

     The influene on the show by the nets is really minimal, if at all.
Mainly the purpose of the nets, from my perspective, is a) to help
educate people about how a show is done, b) to show respect for some of
those linked in who are in the SF community, and c) to get barraged by
questions about my characters and universe, knowing that when I get hit
by a question I hadn't considered, and answering it, I've learned a bit
more about my own story, which helps round it out.

                                                                         jms
