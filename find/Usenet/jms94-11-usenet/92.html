<H2>Five years!! That's it??????</H2>
19 Nov 1994<PRE>     I've mentioned before that there's a side-story that could go off,
within the B5 universe, with a few of our characters, once the Babylon 5
story itself comes to an end in its fifth year, but that's a long ways off,
and I don't know if that's realistic.

     You have to understand...I never came in wanting to be a producer.
I'm a *writer*, and I only got here because it was the only way to protect
the words...create and run the damned show so nobody can mess with it.
Once I've finished the Babylon story, assuming it runs its full length,
(5 years alone, more if there is that doubtful spinoff), the story is
over.  Every story has a beginning, middle and end, and the story's over
when it's over.

     I've also made no bones about the fact that, should the Babylon story
run its full term, I will have said just about everything I want to say in
television, and plan to get out, go back to writing novels.

     My philosophy: find what it is you want to say, walk in the room,
say it, and get the hell out.  (Second philosophy behind that one: when in
doubt, roll in a grenade and come in firing.)

                                                                       jms
