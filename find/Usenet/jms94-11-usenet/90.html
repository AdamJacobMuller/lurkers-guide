<H2>Londo being tortured in A Dist</H2>
19 Nov 1994<PRE>     Everyone who reads this thread...this is a bogus thread, the so
called "spoilers" are fakes and have nothing to do with the episode.

     I would, however, suggest that perhaps the poster of this original
bogus storyline go work with the PTEN marketing people making trailers
for our show...couldn't be any less accurate than they are now....

                                                                         jms
