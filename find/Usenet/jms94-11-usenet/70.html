<H2>JMS: RE: Underwriting + Undera</H2>
16 Nov 1994<PRE>     I scuttled my story for "The Customer is Always Right," a stand-alone,
because I decided it wasn't up to par, and walked over some of the turf
ST had walked over.

                                                                        jms
