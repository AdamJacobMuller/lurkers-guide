<H2>ATTN JMS: Political opinions o</H2>
2 Nov 1994<PRE>     The similarity to the Kennedy situation, and the use of the LBJ
swearing-in photo as reference for the Earthforce One shot, were
definitely intentional.  Remember, we're trying to construct a metaphor
here, as one of the levels on which the show operates.

     What do *I* personally think re: the Kennedy situation?  I can't
think of anything less interesting, and less grounded, than my own
opinion on this subject.  I've done an awful lot of reading in this
area, but there are a lot of folks who know a hell of a lot more than I
do, with probably many of them on this system.

     The House Subcommittee that investigated this issue some time ago
came to the conclusion that there most likely *was* a conspiracy of
some sort, but couldn't find any overwhelming evidence to any other
shooter (these being two different but important issues).  Do I think
there was some sort of conspiracy (and to qualify as conspiracy you only
need one or two other people)?  Yes.  Were there other shooters?  My
sense is probably, but not necessarily.  Will we ever know the full
story?  No.  Should we ever stop trying?  No.
