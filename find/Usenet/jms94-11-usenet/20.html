<H2>JMS: Good Choice!</H2>
5 Nov 1994<PRE>     The nice thing is that Bruce's likeableness (is that a word?) isn't
just confined to the camera.  He's honestly a nifty guy.  He's friendly
to everyone on the set, even casual visitors.  He's what's called a "team
player," in that his concern is for the other actor, and gives as much off
camera for the actor to play against as when he's on-camera.  He's charmed
the hell out of just about everyone involved in making B5, and that's not
an easy task.
