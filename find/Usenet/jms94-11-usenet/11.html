<H2>Some ACTUAL SHOW questions WAS</H2>
2 Nov 1994<PRE>     We try to accommodate our actors where we possibly can.  For
instance, one of our actors will tentatively be doing a CD Rom movie
project, and will need two days off in the middle of shooting.  So while
we can't guarantee (we just got in the script and are now breaking out the
shooting schedule), we're certainly going to try our best to work this
out, and probably will be able to.  Actors need to take every free chance
they have to work; the more work they do, the better they get; the better
they get, the better my show gets.  As long as it doesn't interfere with
production, I have no problem with it.
