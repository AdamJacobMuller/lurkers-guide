<H2>(JMS, your thoughts?) Re: Real</H2>
15 Nov 1994<PRE>     Y'know, I'm really getting sick of Theron's whining and constant
second-guessing and "personal observations" about me, Michael, and how
this show works when he is absolutely without any information on which
to base these suppositions.

     No, Michael wasn't in the first episode.  Why?  Because after we
went our separate ways in the spring, he headed back to New York for some
pending offers there.  HE WAS NOT AVAILABLE TO SHOOT.  Okay, Theron?  CAn
we be clear on this?  Can I be *ANY* clearer on this?  We DID grab
a piece with him before he left, which will be dropped in later in the
season.

     I don't know which world you live in, Theron, but I live in the real
world that has to consider cross-continental flights, shooting schedules,
and a thousand other areas.

     Further, in episode one, from a strictly creative point of view,
I had to a) introduce a new character and make him interesting, b) tie
up some important war threads from season one, c) come up with a present
time/foreground story (the Tragati) to make the episode self-contained,
d) keep all of the other characters moving...and a zillion other things.
If I had dropped a piece with Sinclair into the midst of this, it would
have royally screwed up my structure.

     I COULD NOT HAVE GIVEN THAT SCENE THE TIME AND ATTENTION AND
IMPORTANCE IT DESERVED.  When we *do* see Sinclair again, it will be in
a context where it will be important, and can be handled properly.

     I *really* don't like people second-guessing me; worse still when
they imply motivations and engage in personal speculations that have
NOTHING WHATSOEVER to do with the real world, or the story that I'm trying
to tell.  Okay, Theron, YOU wouldn't have done it this way.  So go make
YOUR show.  This is mine.  And I'll do it as I see fit, in order to tell
the story that I want to tell.

     Can we now resolve this and move on?

                                                                        jms
