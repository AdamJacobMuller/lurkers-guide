<H2>Re: THE GEOMETRY OF SHADOWS --</H2>
18 Nov 1994<PRE>     I have yelled, frequently and consistently, about the trailers for
the series, *especially* the use of prior episode's footage, since in my
view it makes it look like a rerun.  The trailers are assembled by PTEN
marketing, which is hooked on the idea of flashy visuals, and if they're
not there, they borrow or cobble them.  And sometimes their version of
the story doesn't touch reality at any two contiguous points.  It's got
nothing to do with me, except that it annoys the hell out of me.

                                                                       jms
