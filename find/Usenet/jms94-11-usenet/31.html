<H2>"Things cannot hold..."</H2>
7 Nov 1994<PRE>     One aspect of the Yeats quote, and the Lincoln quote, and the
Tennyson quote(s), and the many others, is that I think a lot of folks
at some point tuned out of, or aren't interested in, literature and
poetry because they've never really been exposed to it.  So just to be a
little subversive, I work some of it into the show.  I choose that which
has meaning to the show, and the characters, in the hopes that (as has
happened here), viewers will dig out the original material and be exposed
to some *really* nifty writing.  Granted that television must entertain
at minimum; it should also elevate and ennoble and educate, and this is
too good an opportunity to waste, provided one does not become didactic
about it.
