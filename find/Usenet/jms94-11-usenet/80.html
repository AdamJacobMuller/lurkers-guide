<H2>Does Harlan really have any in</H2>
18 Nov 1994<PRE>     Yes, Harlan and I are friends.  His role on the show is whatever he
wants it to be, as he wants it to be.  He describes it as being a mad dog
nipping at my ankles.  I describe him as alternatively a free-floating
agent of chaos, or Jiminy Cricket, depending.
