<H2>ATTN: JMS: Organization, Man!</H2>
18 Nov 1994<PRE>     This is gonna sound really awful, and I'm not sure if this is good
or bad, but my "method of organization"...is just basically that I keep it
all in my head.  I've tried day timers, calendars, planners, and I tend to
forget to write stuff down in it.  I just tend to keep all this stuff in
my head.  Sometimes I forget something, but usually it's all there.

                                                                          jms
