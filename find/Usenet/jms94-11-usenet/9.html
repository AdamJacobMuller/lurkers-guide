<H2>Re: USA TODAY WRITER STANDS BY</H2>
2 Nov 1994<PRE>     What is most hurtful about this is that Michael O'Hare has been out
there *really* pulling for the show lately, talking it up at the Big-E
Con over the past weekend, wishing everyone well, looking to the future,
reinforcing everything said here, he's been nothing but nifty...and along
come people obsessed with poisoning the well and hurting Michael in the
process.
