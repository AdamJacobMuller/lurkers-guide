<H2>"GoS" blow by blow (SPOILERS)</H2>
18 Nov 1994<PRE>     "A race that speaks in macros" referred to the Drazi constantly
repeating their stance, Green must fight Purple, Purple must fight Green,
over and over...macros.

     Sheridan wasn't so much talking to himself at the end, as he was to
the Tech who'd just asked about clearing the Technomages for jump.
