<H2>Re: Underwriting + Underacting</H2>
15 Nov 1994<PRE>     Oddly enough, while I always had just one title for each of the first
two season, I have several competing titles for year three, and haven't
quite decided which to go with.  Somewhere near the top of the list is,
"I am become Death, the Destroyer of Worlds."  May be a bit too much,
though....

                                                                          jms
