<H2>The new "Tech #1" &lt;sniff&gt; (no</H2>
4 Nov 1994<PRE>     Just as an advisory...the woman who spoke up in PoD (the tech who
told Sheridan that Security wanted him) is not a Tech 1 replacement; she
was there just for that one episode.  We have a number of folks floating
through that area now, because logically you would have rotating crews.

                                                                         jms
