2 Nov 1994<PRE>     At this juncture, as you say, I have no further interest in
responding to these people, since their agenda is quite clear.  So much
crap has been said about this show, so much misinformation put out by
people, that it can make you crazy.  (Several newspapers and stations said
point blank that there were NO plans for Sinclair to return, that he
would NOT return...and here I am in my office, looking at footage we shot
which we're about to use for season two.)

     To your comment about personalities entering the fray and/or getting
targeted...I guess I keep forgetting that part of it.  I have never really
considered myself a *PERSONALITY*...wasn't altogether sure I *had* one
outside of the work....
