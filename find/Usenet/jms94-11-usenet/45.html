<H2>Attn JMS: Chrysalis and JFK (S</H2>
10 Nov 1994<PRE>     Actually, I was born in 54, so we're about the same age.  Oddly, I
don't remember the day of the shooting; what I *do* remember is watching
JFK's funeral, and not entirely understanding the depth of the event, but
fully grasping the emotions around me.  That will linger forever.
