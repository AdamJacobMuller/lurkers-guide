<H2>Evidence (Revelations SPOILERS</H2>
22 Nov 1994<PRE>     Copies of the evidence were made, but the question is what is the
available evidence to BE copied?  Frankly, there isn't much.  There are
no witnesses, very little physical evidence.  If you tried to make a case
with what they've got, you'd be laughed out of the courtroom.

                                                                        jms
