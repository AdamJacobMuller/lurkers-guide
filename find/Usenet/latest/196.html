<H2>Re: Finally! B5 Bible/Treatment Available!</H2>
13 Nov 1999<PRE>&gt;I've been meaning to ask this since I got the Crusade Bible...Does the
&gt;writers
&gt;bible change year to year?  I would think it would, if only to take into
&gt;account everything that is revealed in past seasons and to point out which
&gt;directions you want the show to go, but this is just guesswork.
&gt;

I think we did a supplementary thing to the bible for year two, but that was
it, and my memory could be off about that.
