20 Mar 1999<PRE>
It's hard to separate out the two, the theme and the images.  We actually had
the music first from Evan, which is normally not the way we do it, we do the
visuals first.  So we set it aside, and did the edit on the shots, which are
designed to create a fairly exotic feeling.  

Then when we had it done, just out of curiousity as a temp track, we laid in
Evan's original music...and it cut right to the music, beat for beat, shot for
shot, right on the cuts, to the second.

We wuz astonished....
