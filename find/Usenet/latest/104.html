<H2>Re: Bad Feelings About the Fan Club Script Offerings</H2>
29 Aug 1999<PRE>&gt;Of course, what is being offered are cheaply produced expensive
&gt;"collectors items."  It really gives me a bad feeling and I hope more
&gt;thought will go into this.
&gt;

There's several differences.  You're getting the acutal physical *script*, not
a published version OF a script, the real deal.  

Second, the Art of Star Wars published several hundred thousand copies of that
script; collector's value is zero.  We will be putting out, at most, a few
hundred copies of each one.  The rarer something is, the more it costs, and the
greater its value.

Third, the $25 price ($20 for an episode) is equal to or less than what is
charged by script houses.

Fouth, unlike these script houses that copy scripts unlawfully and never pay a
dime to the author or the studio, all the B5 authors whose scripts we publish,
like Larry or David or DC or others, will get a 10% commission on the sales.
