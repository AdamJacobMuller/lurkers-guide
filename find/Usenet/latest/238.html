<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Difference between CoS script and actual filmed episode</H2>
2 Dec 1999<PRE>Any time you shoot an episode, some lines or other, or even partial scenes (or
whole scenes) can end up on the cutting room floor to fit.  Dry, we ran about
42 minutes 15 seconds 12 frames (I think), and we had to hit that every time
for formatting purposes.  So you edit it all to fit, and sometimes you have to
leave stuff out to make it all work.
