10 Feb 2000<PRE>&gt;I really hope that you will have the chance to work with the people from
&gt;WB and give some input to the project.

So do I.
&gt;Did someone from Warner contact you?

Nope.

&gt;Can you tell us something about what kind of material you want to see on
&gt;a Babylon 5 DVD? 
&gt;My first thoughts was comments from you, lost scenes, bloopers, story
&gt;background and some information about the CGI from FI and ND would be
&gt;great, too.

You just answered that for me.  I'd like to see all that stuff on, plus
commentaries from cast or crew, script pages, storyboards, sketches, all the
stuff that is still find-able, but which may begin to disappear over the years.
