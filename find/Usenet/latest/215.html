23 Nov 1999<PRE>&gt;Maybe now they aren't &lt;that&gt; good.  Most of their crimes are those of
&gt;self-indulgence, and self-congratulation.

Having been a journalist myself, I also kind of have a problem with an editor
of a publication using that publication as a tool in a fanboy vendetta.  But
that's just me, I'm whacky that way.
