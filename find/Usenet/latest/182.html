2 Nov 1999<PRE>&gt;Unfortunately, Joe doesn't seem to be listening to us.  As I understand
&gt;it, some form of production memos are pretty normal on most shows. I had
&gt;thought Season 1 of B5 just for reasonable comparison.
&gt;

No...it's just that there really aren't any, in terms of story.  The very few
comments that came from our WB liaison were always sensible; if I disagreed, he
deferred to my judgment; and they were always handled within a 2 or 5 minute
phone call.  There's practically zero paper trail for that period.
