<H2>Re: Crusade : It's the ratings folks!</H2>
4 Mar 1999<PRE>&gt;First, it's the ratings. As I remember ACTA got something in the range
&gt;of 2.3 to 2.8, something like that. That my friends is everything. If it
&gt;had gotten, say a 10, TNT would be falling over itself to keep the show.

Nothing on cable -- nada -- gets a 10 rating.  The successful shows get
somewhere from a 1 to a 3 rating, that's it.  That's all the penetration you
can get given the number of sets that have cable.

Sliders, considered a big hit on SFC, generally gets a 1.0 rating.
