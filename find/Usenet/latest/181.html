<H2>Re: ATTN JMS--B5 Calendar canon?</H2>
2 Nov 1999<PRE>&gt;I just picked up the new year 2000 B5 calendar from Slow Dazzle, a very nifty
&gt;thing btw, and was wondering if the various dates mentioned are considered
&gt;canon.

I don't know since they still haven't sent me one (though I've asked).

&gt;I understand a detailed chronology of the B5 universe will be published
&gt;shortly
&gt;in the B5 magazine; looking forward to that quite a bit.

It's *truly* an astonishing piece of work.  I commend everyone out there with
even the vaguest interest in B5 to pick up these issues with the chronology
(it's just *huge* and totally inclusive).
