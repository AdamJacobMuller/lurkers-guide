23 Oct 1999<PRE>&gt;I was reading through the forums in the FirstOnes message boards a while ago
&gt;and there has been some discussion about what the first 3 Babylon stations
&gt;looked like and what colors they were

They went in spectrum order, from red, a coule of interim colors I can't
remember, to green, to blue.
