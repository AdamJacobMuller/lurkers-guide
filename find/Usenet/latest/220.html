<H2>Re: JMS: Some bible questions/praise</H2>
26 Nov 1999<PRE>&gt;My recollection is that this is something that The Great Maker
&gt;has admitted lying about.  The triple-encrypted computer files
&gt;were actually a boxful of index cards on a shelf in his office
&gt;where he could stare at them while telling visitors about
&gt;the triple-encrypted computer files.

No, that is completely untrue.  The cards were a distillation of my notes,
broken down by season.  

Please don't put words in my mouth, I have enough trouble with the ones that I
put there on my own.
