<H2>Re: preview to jms comic out now</H2>
26 Mar 1999<PRE>&gt;There's a web article &amp; art preview at:
&gt; http://www.detnews.com/metro/hobbies/comix/stories/9903/19/
&gt;
&gt;Are these pages from the #0 (art by Brian Ching), or #1 (art by series
&gt;regular Kui Cha)? 

Dunno, I'll have to go look and see what they used.

BTW, just closed the deal today to write a TV movie (non-SF) for one of the
networks while we're waiting for pilots to be picked up in May.  Should be fun.
 (Can't talk about it at this time beyond that.)
