<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Third Psi-Corps Book</H2>
27 May 1999<PRE>&gt;When will the third Psi-Corps. book be out, &amp; what will come out
&gt;next--the first Technomage book, or the first Centauri book?

The third Psi Corps book just arrived in manuscript form, so it should be
soonish.  After that, I'm not sure which comes next.

&gt;So TNT wanted Sci-Fi to fund
&gt;all 22 episodes for the first season in order for them to pick it up &amp;
&gt;complete the season? 

That's correct.

&gt;I also heard that TNT wanted Dureena to be the
&gt;"sexual-explorer".  TNT obviously has a bunch of morons running that
&gt;network!

I think either Dureena or Eilerson would've been fine, as long as the requisite
amount of sex got in, which was the reason behind the notion.
