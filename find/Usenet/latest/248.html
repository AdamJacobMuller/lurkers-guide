12 Dec 1999<PRE>&gt;She's been grumbling a lot about how all that
&gt;money for failed missions could've gone to the homeless and worthier
&gt;programs

Or one stealth bomber.

Do her and yourself a favor: buy her a copy of Michael Moore's DOWNSIZE
THIS...and let her get a sense of where far, FAR more money is really going.
