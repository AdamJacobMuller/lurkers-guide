<H2>Re: PsiCorps 2: Deadly Relations...a readers review</H2>
4 Mar 1999<PRE>I think book 2 is terrific as well, maybe in some ways better than 1 because
though it's not as epic, it really makes the Psi Corps come alive in some nifty
ways.

I haven't seen 3 yet, but it should be a real kick.

The technomage trilogy, at this point, may work out to be my favorite, given
how much of the B5 storyline it interweaves.
