<H2>Oops...Crusade, NOT B5 jackets</H2>
7 Oct 1999<PRE>I'd left this info under the heading "I'm an Idiot," then I realized that
nobody would download that one to read because it isn't newsworthy or a secret.

Anyway...I stooged it: I typed B5 jackets available when I meant to type
Crusade jackets available on a prior message.  Terminal brain fart.  Mea culpa,
mea culpa, mea maxima culprrrrrrrrpppppfhhhh.
