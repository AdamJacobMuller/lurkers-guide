4 Sep 1999<PRE>Logging on from Australia....

Actually, I'm not disillusioned.  Disappointed, sure, in how TNT chose to treat
the show...but understand that a 5 year run is the anomaly in TV, even more so
in SF.  B5 was the first non-Trek space-based SF series to go more than 3
seasons in 30 years.  So the record ain't great.

But if anything, I've been just as busy on other projects since Crusade ended,
and all of it is what Crusade was not during the last half-year of its
production: they're fun again.  I'm enjoying myself, and that's what I got into
this thing for in the first place.

There's plenty of room to do good work; you just have to find proper vessels
into which to place your work.
