29 Aug 1999<PRE>Ignore the other post...I hit the wrong flipping button.

To quote again:

&gt;Just by catagory, I know that you've written:
&gt;
&gt;stage plays          novels         short stories           comic books
&gt;song lyrics             newspaper articles       radio shows      magazine
&gt;columns
&gt;screenplays for both live action and animated from 1/2 hour to MOW length 
&gt;a textbook
&gt;So my question is:  Is there anything you simply can't or won't write?  Or
&gt;have
&gt;you just not gotten around to poetry and symphonies yet? &lt;g&gt;

I totally suck at poetry.  At best I can come up with a kind of doggerel that
should never be seen by anydamnbody.

My feeling is that each kind of writing you do makes you better at another kind
of writing, therefore it behooves you to do it all, if at all possible. 
Writing an article teaches you structure, which you use in a screenplay; a
screenplay teaches you dialogue which you use in a short story; a short story
teaches you narrative structure which you can apply to novels...and so on.

It's all meant to be a learning experience.  It's when you stop learning that
the trouble starts.
