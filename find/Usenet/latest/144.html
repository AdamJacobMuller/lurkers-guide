3 Oct 1999<PRE>&gt;The story issues aside, I am also curious how much of an outline do you
&gt;write for the trilogies.  Is it a couple of paragraphs or many pages?  Are
&gt;there any plans in the works that the fans would be able to view the
&gt;outlines?
&gt;

It varies, but on average each outline is about 25-35 pages.
