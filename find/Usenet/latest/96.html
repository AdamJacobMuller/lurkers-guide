25 Aug 1999<PRE>&gt;Noticed that there will be a new B5 book coming out in the UK in November(I
&gt;think) called the Babylon 5 Omnibus I.  It says it is written by J. Vornholt
&gt;and L. Tilton.  Would this be a collection of the 1st three Dell novels?

Yep.  Don't know if they'll be doing any more.
