<H2>Re: ATTN JMS:  B5 Scripts Available Through Fan Club</H2>
29 Aug 1999<PRE>Yeah, we plan to sell a number of B5 scripts in chronological order, for a
limited period, one or so per month.  What that means is: we'll take orders on
a script such as the Gathering from September 1 to the end of the month.  Then
we'll print up only as many copies as have been ordered.  That's it.  Then we
move to the next one.  It'll probably take years before it would cycle through
all the scripts we make available before we got back to the Gathering again. 
So when they're gone, for all intents and purposes, they're gone.
