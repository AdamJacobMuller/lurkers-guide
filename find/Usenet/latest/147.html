<H2>Reminder re: jms email</H2>
5 Oct 1999<PRE>Every so often I have to post this...folks who've seen this before and know the
drill, feel free to ignore it.

Folks...understand that there are roughly 10-15 million of you out there, many
of whom own PCs with modems.  That's a lot of people, many of whom have similar
questions/thoughts/comments.

The best place for those is here, in this forum, not in my personal email
account.  It puts me in the position of either not answering ("what a rude
sonofabitch, he says he'll answer fans but he didn't answer my email after I
sent it to him TEN TIMES asking the same question") (and one such email did
come to me with that complaint, by the way), saying I can't reply in email,
which takes nearly as much time as replying, or ultimately repeating the same
information every time somebody asks in email a question somebody else asked a
week earlier.

*Please* reserve the use of this email account for *PERSONAL  MATTERS OR
MATTERS WHICH YOU DO NOT WANT DISCUSSED PUBLICLY*, not questions about stories,
props, plots, arcs, ship armaments (you have NO idea how many of THOSE I get
daily), contracts or the like.  I'd really rather not have to change my email
address because I've had this one for a long time, but the emailbox is filling
up these days with just those sorts of questions, and I've started to miss
important email because it gets lost in the piles of "so what does Ulkesh mean
and what was Kosh's first name?" messages.

Thankyew.
