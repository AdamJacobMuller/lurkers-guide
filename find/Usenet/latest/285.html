16 Jan 2000<PRE>&gt;Have you done as well
&gt;financially as you hoped you might from B5?  I remember you saying that
&gt;you own a piece of the *net* profits from B5.  Has it shown a *net*
&gt;profit yet? 

No, nor will it ever.  That's how Hollywood bookkeeping works.  We know,
because e were told, that when the show was still first airing on PTEN, it was
a mandate that ALL PTEN shows had to show a profit every season in order to be
renewed.  That was a hard and fast rule.  

Each year, we got renewed, because we made a profit for WB.  Once, in a meeting
with the execs after year 3, they complimented us on how much money the show
had made for WB.

Then they turn right around and, for purposes of net participation, pump out
balance sheets that show we'll forever be in the red.

Net means nothing because they can continue to charge anything and everything
against the revenue, and you can never show a profit on paper; it's only if you
own a piece of the gross that actual money appears.
