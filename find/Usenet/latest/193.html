<H2>Re: Finally! B5 Bible/Treatment Available!</H2>
10 Nov 1999<PRE>&gt;When I clicked to add either B5 Bible to my cart, it gave me the "We're
&gt;sorry, but this product is not currently available with the attributes you
&gt;selected." message.

The info is *just now* starting to go up, so I imagine they are still adding in
the info to the system.
