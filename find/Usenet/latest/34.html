<H2>Re: JMS: words coming back</H2>
3 Apr 1999<PRE>&gt;I've said it before and I'll say it again as often as anybody'll stand still
&gt;to
&gt;listen.  What I see as your greatest strength as a writer is the 'density'
&gt;that
&gt;you bring to your stories. 

It's just the way I'm hardwired.  Years ago, a bunch of us (college years) went
in to help put down a carpet in a building, using scraps from a carpet store,
and everybody's putting down these huge swaths of carpeting, and I'm over in
the corner with these 2 and 3 inch pieces making a complex pattern, and they're
all "will you STOP that and just grab some big pieces," but it ain't how I'm
wired up.

It's all in the details.
