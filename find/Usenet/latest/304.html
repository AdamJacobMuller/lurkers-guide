<H2>Re: Voice in the Wilderness scripts</H2>
9 Feb 2000<PRE>&gt; The binding had snapped apart in the post and the thing had to be
&gt;treated with kid gloves. I've since heard others have had similar problems.

The binding was done rather than just using brads because we thought it would
make the thing spiffier.  I've copied your message to the manager of the club
and we'll see about making the packaging better.  This is the first time I've
heard of the problem.
