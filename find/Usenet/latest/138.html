<H2>Re: Attn JMS:  Why SF?</H2>
23 Sep 1999<PRE>&gt;In the midst of a small debate about just what constitutes SF, it occured to
&gt;me
&gt;to ask: as a writer, why do you work in SF?  What attracts you to the genre?
&gt;

I've worked in a variety of genres -- murder mysteries, SF, detective series,
animation/comedy, horror...I kinda like all of them.  If I have a predilection
toward SF it's simply because I grew up an SF fan.  In brief: ah likes it.
