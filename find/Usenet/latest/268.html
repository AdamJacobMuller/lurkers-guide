<H2>Re: ATTN: JMS Crusade Jacket quality</H2>
31 Dec 1999<PRE>&gt;Opened box for Crusade jacket with some forboding because ordering
&gt;clothing online is not something I do easily. Software, okay, but clothing
&gt;is so personal. However, I am VERY impressed with the  quality of material
&gt;(classy), design (simple but elegant), embroidery (tight, bright and
&gt;proportioned) and overall proportions and shape. 

Thanks.  You have to understand that what we did was to make the jackets
*identical in every way* with the ones we gave the cast and crew in workmanship
and quality.  That's why it's kind of a big deal.  It costs a hell of a lot to
get that quality, so there really ain't much profit in it, but if we were going
to do it, I wanted it done right.

&gt;That said, I couldn't help bring back an old but related topic, namely the
&gt;Babylon 5 jackets. 

We're planning those for the spring, again in a limited edition.
