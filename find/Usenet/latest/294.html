31 Jan 2000<PRE>&gt;Besides, how does Galen know what buttons to press? Didn't he meet
&gt;Dureena fairly recently? I didn't see them really getting to know so
&gt;much about each other during the show.

If a technomage can know the 6 words to make someone fall in love with you
forever, he can sure as heck know which buttons to push on Dureena.
