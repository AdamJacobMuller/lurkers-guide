<H2>Re: OT: The Haunting</H2>
9 Feb 2000<PRE>&gt;I'd seen it as a teenager, and I was not a fan of horror films, and
&gt;to prove the point it scared the bejeebers out of me. The scariest part of
&gt;'The Haunting' was that the audience never saw the monster. That's what
&gt;kept the intensity of the fear going throughout the movie.

About the only film of that period that's more unsettling is SECONDS, with (of
all people) Rock Hudson.  It's a terrific film, marginally speculative fiction,
but it'll utterly leave you with the heebie-jeebies.
