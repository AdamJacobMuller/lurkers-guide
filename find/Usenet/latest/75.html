16 Jun 1999<PRE>I finished reading the book this past weekend, and it's possibly the best of
the three, which I didn't think I'd say, given how much I liked the first two.

What I think fans will like about it most is that while the first two dealt
with what led up to B5's timeline, some of able to be inferred from stuff, this
is all stuff that is yet to come...and it's nifty.
