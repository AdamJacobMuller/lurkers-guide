2 Oct 1999<PRE>&gt;When/how did Cavelos work on 'The Shadow Arc'?  I take it this means the
&gt;Shadow War (Seasons Three and Four), but as I understand it Cavelos was
&gt;only brought on in Season Five as a story editor (as well as editing the
&gt;B5 numbered novels and writing 7 herself), then she went on to Crusade.
&gt;
&gt;wait, do you refer to her writing "The Shadow Within" (B5 Book 7)?
&gt;
Where did you get THAT information?  She was never a story editor on the
series, she was the editor for the Dell books far earlier than S5.  And the one
she wrote (noted above) dealt with Z'ha'dum and shadow technology and other
advanced tech stuff, and so that made her right for the technomages.
