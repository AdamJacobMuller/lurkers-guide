15 Nov 1999<PRE>&gt;1) Is Kosh supposed to be the Oracle of Delphi? It just hit me today that he
&gt;has those babbling sounds in the suit (that sounds like wind rustling in
&gt;leaves) and then he makes a short statement that no one understands until
&gt;what he has said has come to pass.
&gt;

Yeah, that's always how I kind of looked at him.

&gt;2) Did you, long ago, have a glimpse of your future like Londo did?
&gt;

Some things I probably should not comment on.
