18 Mar 1999<PRE>&gt;Haven't seen them yet, but just read description of Crusade opening titles.
&gt; Sounds sorta like the second part of the opening to The Prisoner, the part
&gt;with the episode title and episode credits.  Was this your intent?

No, it draws from the primary questions asked in the B5 series.
