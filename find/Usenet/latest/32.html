1 Apr 1999<PRE>There are not more B5 TV movies on the boards, though next week we're shooting
the live-action elements of the Sierra computer game (with Lochley, Sheridan,
Delenn, Garibaldi and others).

Aside from the coming novels, I've just turned in the first of three B5 stories
that will be appearing in Amazing Stories Magazine.  The first one, "The Shadow
of his Thoughts," is a Londo story taking place in the days shortly after his
coronation as Emperor.
