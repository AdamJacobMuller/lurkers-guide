<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Music Tastes (B5 Magazine)</H2>
26 Nov 1999<PRE>&gt;In the latest B5 Magazine (US), they were asking people involved with
&gt;B5, including yourself, what their musical-tastes were.  You said that
&gt;you like a group called Kodo.  I have never heard of them--what kind of
&gt;music do they perform?

It's KODO, all caps, and they're a Japanese...I don't know if group is the
right word, collective?...bunch who use Kodo drums and similar massive drums
for traditional Japanese music of the kind that gets the blood moving.

For a newcomer to that kind of music, I suggest SAI-SO, their latest which is
actually a remix of their Iridori album by Western DJ/mixer guys.

If you just want to jump in, get their Live at the Acropolis CD...it's fucking
brilliant.
