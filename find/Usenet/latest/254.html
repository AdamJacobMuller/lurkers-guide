<H2>don't abuse jms email</H2>
18 Dec 1999<PRE>Those of you know know the drill can ignore this.  The rest....

I've said it here again and again: If you have a technical question, post it to
the newsgroup.  MY PRIVATE EMAIL IS TO BE USED ONLY FOR PRIVATE MATTERS THAT
CANNOT BE DISCUSSED PUBLICLY FOR WHATEVER LEGITIMATE REASON.

Also, series on the air or not, DO NOT SEND ME STORY IDEAS, or send me a note
with a question you're asking for a fanfic thing you're writing and then
proceed to tell me the story as it's "not a story idea, it's the story I'm
writing for my fanfic publication."  Only an idiot cannot perceive that these
two are the same thing.

Yet, despite this request, I continue to get constant email broaching those two
requests, really the only ones I've put in, and I don't think they're asking
too much.  And now they're starting to come in email to the straczynski@aol.com
address.

I'm appending just one of the endless such notes I get these days as an example
of something that could be just as well posted publicly, and has a zillion
questions, which if I answered every one, for every email I get, I would do
nothing else, ever, at any time.

Folks, and you know who you are, either you play by the few small rules I've
asked you to honor, or I'm going to have to start closing off my email address
to only people I know...because I use those addresses for business and I have
to wade through ten thousand "what's the defense grid EMP output?" type
messages to find the mail I have to answer.

I don't want to have to do that, but if I continue to get essentially spammed
with this sort of thing, I will.

So do NOT send me the following sort of note.  Please honor the request
detailed above (and sending me a note that says, "I know you said not to send
you this kind of note, but this is just a one-time question" doesn't work
because there are FIFTEEN MILLION of you with "one-time questions".)

I've always tried to maintain an open email policy, but it really is starting
to get abused beyond the point where I can handle it efficiently.

Thank you.

What Not To Send Me.  I have removed the person's name to avoid subjecting him
to ridicule.  Call me a softy.  (And don't you love how it says "A question"
when it's 8 questions?)
