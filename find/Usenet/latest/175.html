<H2>Re: JMS: Apologies in advance... a TNT Question</H2>
29 Oct 1999<PRE>&gt;My question:  what the hell happened?  How did TNT change so much in
&gt;regards to B5/Crusade?  From what little I know, it seemed that the
&gt;execs thought since it was a new series they could change it (unlike the
&gt;already established B5), but what happened?!

Simple answer: TNT Atlanta had never gotten involved before.  Also, B5 was a
known commodity, it was never a question of getting input on the direction of
the show, we just kept doing what we'd been doing.  Crusade was a new show, and
people who didn't understand SF wanted a hand in determining the direction of
the series.
