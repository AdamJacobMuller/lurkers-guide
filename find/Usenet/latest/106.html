<H2>Re: Attn JMS: Medieval Metaphors</H2>
31 Aug 1999<PRE>&gt;After all that said, I
&gt;want to know: why have you chosen all those medieval metaphors to depict
&gt;the future of mankind? Do you believe we are getting back to the values
&gt;of Dark Ages in some way?

Not per se, no, just applying some of the myths and models from that period to
the future.
