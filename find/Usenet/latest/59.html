21 May 1999<PRE>I calls 'em as I sees 'em.  Always have, always will.  To do any less would be
a disservice and a dishonesty.

And believe me, it ain't gonna factor into SFC's decision one way or another. 
If any of that had even the potential for being true, then I wouldn't have
pending offers from literally all 3 major networks and 4 studios to come in and
run shows for them.

It's a non-issue.  Honest.  Would this face lie?
