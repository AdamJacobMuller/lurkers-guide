<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: four quick questions</H2>
20 Nov 1999<PRE>&gt;I read in the german Babylon 5 newsgroup that all Crusade episodes will
&gt;be available as rental video tapes with german synchronisation in
&gt;february 2000. Do you know anything about that? Will Crusade also be
&gt;available in the stores?

I'm afraid I've no idea.

&gt;The Lurkers Guide mentioned an artikel from Cleveland Live
&gt;(http://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/pd/news/tuesday/e16scif.ssf)
&gt;with a very interesting quote:
&gt;
&gt;"X-Files" creator Chris Carter and "Babylon 5" creator J. Michael
&gt;Straczynski are teaming up for a CBS drama. 
&gt;Any comments from you? ;-)
&gt;
Not at this time.

&gt;Is there a chance to see you next year in London? In march there will be
&gt;the Starfury Millenium Con (no Wolf359 con AFAIK) with
&gt;Peter, Andreas, Richard and Jason and some german B5 fans, too!
&gt;
No, no plans for UK conventions next year, and would not be involved with this
one in any event given some of the folks involved.

&gt;And final...any news from the DVD sector?

Not that I've heard.
