12 Sep 1999<PRE>&gt;He then joked about a newmovie, "&gt; &gt; Women who go crazy every 28 days.  The
&gt;Blair Bitch Project." 

Actually, it was about some women who, tied to the cycles of the moon, go nuts
every 28 days, called "The Were Bitch Project."  Otherwise the pun doesn't
work.

I also apologized in advance for that, because of all the words I use -- and I
use 'em all, I think every word in the King's english is fine by me -- that's
the only one that I tend not to use and have never used before in a
presentation, but as I said, I needed it to make the pun work.

Other than that, when it comes to language...well, fuck it.
