<H2>Re: ATTN JMS:  Wrestlers on Voyager</H2>
11 Sep 1999<PRE>&gt;I recently heard that UPN wants to put wrestlers on Voyager now.  What
&gt;is your opinion on this?  I think the "Wrestlers on SF-Programs" thing
&gt;is really getting out of hand!
&gt;PS--I heard that the Voyager producers are going along with this
&gt;wrestling idea.  At least you had the integrity not to.

I once heard someone say, in response to the idea of sendihng Geraldo Rivera
into space on the Shuttle, "at least we'll finally be able to see the effect of
a vacuum *on* a vacuum."

I'm sorry, what was your question again...?
