<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: *sigh* a quick Question</H2>
27 Oct 1999<PRE>&gt;The only MAJOR changes were in "War Zone" and the other episodes, discluding
&gt;the last five, were only minor changes. Correct? They weren't something like
&gt;what they did in "War Zone"; they didn't change the plot/whichever that was
&gt;in WAR ZONE. Right?

This is a greyer question than appears at first blush.

You need to understand that the notes-giving process was ongoing, that every
day was a fight, and every day there were pressures from WB and others to
accede to those requests and notes.  We were told repeatedly, "Look, give 'em
the show they want for the first year, then you can make it your way in the
second season."  

I've always had a policy that if a note makes sense, whoEVER it comes from -- a
network, a grip, a carpenter, whoever -- then I'll listen to it.  So I tried,
where possible, to listen for any notes that made sense in the whirlwind of
ka-ka that came our way.  Some who were not there said that I was acting
unreasonably, and that only the one script WarZone was really affected, that
the other scripts were already written and thus not affected.  But nothing
could be further from the truth.  They were all whittled at in big or small
ways.

If a note didn't make sense...then the answer had to be No.

The "big no" meeting was specifically about a small percentage of the
scripts...and only one meeting out of many.  They kept at us *constantly*.  

As Michelangelo said, "Trifles make perfection, and perfection is no trifle." 
Sometimes the notes nibbled at big issues, sometimes at small ones, but there
are profound effects either way.  Sometimes doing something as small as
changing the rhythm of a scene can destroy it.  Take a particularly memorable
piece of classical music (I won't even name it to illustrate the point further)
that begins "dah-dah-dah-DAAAH."  

Now change it to "dah-dah-dah-BLAAAT."  It's only one note difference.  You can
say it' s just a teensy change.  But your gut says it ain't right, something
there doesn't work.  

Just for the hell of it...I'm going to reprint now one of my memos to TNT,
omitting the name of the person involved.  This is emblematic of some of the
exchanges.  (This memo was widely distributed to TNT, WB and Babylonian folks
involved in the creative stuff, so it's by no means private.)

Message follows.
