<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Fan Fiction</H2>
16 Sep 1999<PRE>Fan fiction, however nice and fuzzy it may be as a community of folks, is still
a form of copyright infringement...it takes characters which are owned by a
studio and mass-produces them (well, even a few hundred copies is technically a
mass).  So no, I can't authorize or sanction it because that would put me at
legal odds with WB, which owns the copyright.
