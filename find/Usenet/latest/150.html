<H2>Re: B5 Jackets at thestation.com</H2>
6 Oct 1999<PRE>&gt;While I'm very interested in reading the scripts, I'm not particularly
&gt;excited
&gt;to have five seasons * 22 episodes of scripts weighing down a bookshelf.  I
&gt;would like to encourage JMS and the fan club to offer a CD-ROM (or two) with
&gt;all the scripts available in some convenient format (e.g., PDF or HTML). 

Only problem with that is that it makes it very easy to print up and sell
copies, or to send them out on the internet.

BTW...I'm an idiot.  I meant to say Crusade jackets in my prior message, not
the B5 jackets.  (And I'm told they'll keep taking Gathering orders until the
8th because the system was down for a bit.)
