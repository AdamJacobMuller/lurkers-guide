<H2>Re: jms = big rock</H2>
27 Apr 1999<PRE>&gt;Wes, it looks like I'll have to update straczynksi'ed to include a secondary
&gt;definition: straczynskied - (1) vt past tense - To be inspired towards
&gt;simultaneous and profound curiosity, anticipation, awe, dread, and somber
&gt;reflection through the skillful use of misdirection, foreshadowing, mental
&gt;torture, and other literary devices leading to disturbed sleep, frightening
&gt;nightmares, hallucinations, compulsive behavior, and general obsession. (2)
&gt;vt past tense - To be obliterated by a large asteroid with the name 8379
&gt;STRACZYNSKI that doesn't go boom 

Oddly, I heard a while back from some Russian speaking folks, and depending on
how you pronounce it and where you put the inflection, Straczynski can mean
either "terror" or "passion."  I kind of like the symmetry of both....
