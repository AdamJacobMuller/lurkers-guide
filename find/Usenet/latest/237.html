1 Dec 1999<PRE>&gt;&gt; Anyone looking at the S1 bible
&gt;&gt; right now sees stuff that was laid out for the later seasons,
&gt;&gt; and it was pretty much all done...
&gt;&gt; right down to telling writers
&gt;&gt; not to get Lyta into a relationship
&gt;&gt; because she would eventually become starstruck by Byron,
&gt;&gt; and I didn't want anything else to get in the way of that.
&gt;
&gt;I thought Byron was originally intended for Ivanova, up until Claudia
&gt;decided to leave the show...???
&gt;

Correct.  Note the use of the word *starstruck*, not *involved with*.  The
theory was that Byron would have gotten involved with Ivanova, who -- feeling
she'd messed up by being too closed off to a somewhat similar person decides to
take a chance with someone, only to have it blow up in her face -- while Lyta
suffered from unrequited love (a constant B5 theme), which would no less fuel
her desire to avenge him.
