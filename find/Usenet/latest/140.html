<H2>Re: JMS: How does Del Rey do it?</H2>
26 Sep 1999<PRE>&gt;Because of this, I'm curious what the process is in making a Babylon 5
&gt;novel from Del Rey?  Why Trilogies? 

In Minbari, all things are three.

&gt; How are authors chosen?  

By mutual consent; they'll suggest someone, and we'll talk about it.  Keyes'
work I somewhat knew, and he seemed right...and Peter David *is* a Centauri. 
Jeanne Cavelos' work on the shadow arc made her correct for the technomage
books.

&gt;How did
&gt;the decision to spotlight the series' history and background, instead
&gt;of the lead characters and the station, come about?  

It's that perverse "let's do the opposite of what the marketing people think"
thing I get into sometimes; there's so much history in the B5 universe, and I'd
worked so much of it out, it seemed a shame to waste it.

Will there be any
&gt;single novels?  

Dunno.

Is Warners &amp; Del Rey willing and/or interested in
&gt;adding Crusade characters and concepts into the B5 books?
&gt;
There will be some...Galen is all through both the technomage books and a bit
in the Centauri books.
