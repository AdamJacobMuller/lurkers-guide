15 Oct 1999<PRE>&gt;I read on the net several months ago that you were working on a new
&gt;television series not releated to B5.  Can you say how that project is
&gt;developing?  When do you expect to get it on the air?
&gt;

The process is long and slow; it took 5 years to get B5 on the air.  This one,
if it goes, will take far less, but it still takes the amount of time it takes.
