<H2>Rising Stars #3 Out November 22nd</H2>
9 Nov 1999<PRE>Just wanted to say that...er, well...I guess the title of this message just
said it.  The next issue of Rising Stars out 11/22 tells the story of Lee
Jackson, the pyrokinetic whose fiery outburst started the whole thing rolling. 
This one also features the artwork of Christian Zanier, who comes on board as
regular penciler with this issue, and does a bang-up job.  This issue also
hints at the motive for the ongoing murders.

It's a corker.
