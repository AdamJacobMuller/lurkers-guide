<H2>Re: JMS: Selling B5 Scripts &amp; Pricing</H2>
22 Nov 1999<PRE>&gt;I appreciate the fact that they are collectibles, my point is some people
&gt;(like
&gt;myself) aren't willing to spend about $2,200 on 110 scripts... it's too much
&gt;money!  I really do want these scripts, but it's too much.  Can't there be a
&gt;cheaper alternative?

Well, for one thing, we're not going to release all 110 scripts, only the
highlights and justifiable releases.  Grey 17 for instance will never be
released, it may only plan to escape....
