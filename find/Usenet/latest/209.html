<H2>Re: ATTN: JMS - Babylon 5 "SERIES 1" Bible</H2>
21 Nov 1999<PRE>&gt;1) The bible refers out to a 200-page Arc document.  Can you tell me if
&gt;this is ever going to be released in any way, shape, or form.

Not a chance.

&gt;2) The bible covers *Season 1* only !  Does this mean we have 4 more of
&gt;these bibles to look forward to (Please say "yes").
&gt;

No, since there were only minor modifications done to the thing for S2, and
there were no other changes done for S3-5.
