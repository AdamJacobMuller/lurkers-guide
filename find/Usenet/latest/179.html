<H2>Re: Attn. JMS B5 on Space</H2>
31 Oct 1999<PRE>&gt;The Space channel (out of Toronto) is currently airing season 5 eps 3
&gt;times a day. (3 PM, 7 PM and 3 AM ET)  Think about this for a
&gt;moment--this amounts to fully one eighth of their broadcast day--not bad
&gt;for the little show that could, eh? 

Cool...thanks, I had no idea.
