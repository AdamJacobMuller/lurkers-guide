<H2>Re: JMS: Crusade 'lost' episodes?</H2>
5 Jun 1999<PRE>&gt;I read that all of the scripts for Season 1 of Crusade had been written.
&gt;What
&gt;happens to them *when* we get Crusade Season 2?  Will those scripts get used
&gt;or
&gt;are they lost to us?  Do they belong to TNT or to Warner Bros?

We only got as far as 16, which is annoying since 14 was where we *really*
cranked up the arc, and 16 was to be the season cliffhanger, shot early to
handle the rather hideous CGI that would have been involved.

The last one written, 16, synchronistically enough, was entitled "End of the
Line."

And WB owns the TV rights to the scripts.
