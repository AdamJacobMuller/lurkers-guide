<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Advice for budding writers???</H2>
7 Apr 1999<PRE>&gt;As someone who hopes to one day get into the television writing scene,
&gt;what advice do you have?
&gt;
&gt;I don't mean in terms of the actual writing of the show/project/etc, but
&gt;in terms of getting it on the air, getting the "important people" to
&gt;actually read it? I know you went through a lot to get B5 on the air
&gt;(especially wiht a premise that everybody doomed to failure as soon as
&gt;they heard it), so how did you do it? You were already known in the biz
&gt;when you pitched B5....but if someone new was trying to break through
&gt;what sort of things would he have to do?

I get this question all the time.  There is only one reply that I can give you:
it is impossible -- let me reemphasize that, impossible -- for a newbie to sell
a TV series without a long track record working in the business.  So there's
really no advice that can be given.
