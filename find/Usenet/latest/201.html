<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Lyta &amp; G'Kar Story (Spoilers)</H2>
17 Nov 1999<PRE>&gt;Also, this may sound dumb, but I was wondering how Lyta was able to send
&gt;G'Kar a telepathic message in the story, since he isn't a telepath.  I
&gt;guess I missed something in the series!

We've had other examples in the show of someone sending a telepathic signal to
someone else who wasn't a teep...Kosh to Sheridan being the one that comes to
mind right offhand.  We've established in the books that a teep can send into a
normal, but obviously it doesn't work in the other direction.
