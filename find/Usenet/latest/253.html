17 Dec 1999<PRE>&gt;Would staying home and watching "Apocalypse Now" count?

Depends on whether or not you plan to burn down the house while you're doing

And for folks looking on, as I'm sure is no surprise to many of you, this
padguy is Peter David, author of the first of the Centauri books that just hit
the stands.  (Who better to write one than a latent Centauri?)

So if you have questions, here's the guy to ask.
