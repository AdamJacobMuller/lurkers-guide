<H2>Re: Attn. JMS: Rising Stars Comic</H2>
27 Mar 1999<PRE>&gt;&lt;&lt;I saw a preview of your new comic "Rising Stars" and I'm looking
&gt;forward to a Watchmen quality story.  It's been a while since
&gt;something really good has been published in comics. &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;It depends on what you mean by "a while"  There are some very good comics
&gt;currently being published although most of them lean more towards four color
&gt;action than watchmen-esque darkness.  
&gt;

There's lots of good stuff out...the new Mage and Grendel books, the Alex Ross
stuff (any of it, definitely liked his latest, Uncle Sam), I've bought but
haven't yet read Kubuki which I hear is also quite good.
