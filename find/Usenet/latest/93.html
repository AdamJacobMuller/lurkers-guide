<H2>Re: Special Effects on Recent Episodes</H2>
22 Aug 1999<PRE>&gt;Has anyone else
&gt;noticed this or am I projecting the overall better episode quality
&gt;onto the special effects?

I think it's this to some extent...also we took a somewhat different approach
to the look of the EFX, and it takes some getting used to.
