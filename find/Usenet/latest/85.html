16 Aug 1999<PRE>&gt;Would there ever be a chance that there would be a movie done for the B5
&gt;univerce? 

WB has inquired about one several times, but I'm in no real rush.  If I were to
do one, it'd be a while down the road, and I'd want to take that time to think
of a really good story, rather than rush something out just to do it.
