<H2>Re: Attn JMS: Typical Episode Budget</H2>
22 Sep 1999<PRE>&gt;For example, one of the figures I remember from the early days of TNG was the
&gt;"$1 million an episode" factoid, and I was wondering how things compared.
&gt;

The average Trek budget was about $1.4 million, sometimes going to $1.6.

The average B5/Crusade budget was about $920,000 per.
