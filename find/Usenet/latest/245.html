<H2>various from jms</H2>
12 Dec 1999<PRE>Some overall quick notes, just some business and housekeeping stuff to get out
of the way....

1) It looks like the genie.com site and address will be unreachable after the
first of January, so anyone using that email address for me should delete it.

2) By a similar token, after the first of the year I'm going to be
quasi-retiring the jmsatb5@aol.com email address, since technically I'm *not*
at B5 anymore, and I'm kind of clearing the decks for other stuff in future.  I
won't delete the ID, because at AOL but rather let it go dormant, because if
you delete it somebody else can begin using it soon after, but I'll gradually
be shifting over to the new address, straczynski@aol.com in terms of answering
email.  

3) Folks sending fan mail to the cast should do so at the fan club mail address
rather than the Ventura Blvd. address, because that's soon going to be set
aside for only personal stuff.

4) My Last Word column in the new B5 Magazine (as well as the one in the issue
prior to this) got foreshortened by about 50% due to an apparent glitch at the
magazine.  So if it ends kinda whacky, that's the reason for it.  They'll
reprint the whole thing in an upcoming issue (and such errors will not occur in
future).

5) The Paul Harper wedding is off, I've decided instead to stay in the bathroom
all night and cry.

Thankyew.
