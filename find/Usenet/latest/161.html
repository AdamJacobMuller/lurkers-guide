<H2>Re: ATTN JMS - Telepath War</H2>
15 Oct 1999<PRE>&gt;I've finished the Bester series. As good as it was, I can't help
&gt;feeling a little disappointed that the Telepath War was not covered
&gt;in detail. Do you have any plan to tell the story or have we heard
&gt;everything we need to know?
&gt;

Thing is, the war is too big and too important to slip into what is, basically,
the personal story of Bester.  So we handled it in much the same way we handled
the Minbari war in most of season 1 and some of 2...we hear about it, and see
the ramifications.  And down the road, we may get a clearer picture of what
happened, and why.
