<H2>airdate correction</H2>
30 Dec 1999<PRE>I was incorrect about the airing of the 48 hours thing for which I was
interviewed; apparently it's going to air Thursday night on CBS, not Friday
night.  Again, I have no idea how much of my interview they did or didn't use,
so I can't guarantee anything, except that I probably said something stupid in
there somewhere.
