23 Sep 1999<PRE>I think Harlan (no surprise) put it best one day: "You get the show you want,
and it gets no PR, no respect; you get another show and a chance to redefine
SF, and they want to make it into wrestling.  You get one thing and they take
away another.  Kiddo, there is a war in heaven over you."
