2 Feb 2000<PRE>&gt;Oh, dear--JMS isn't playing nice again!  :)

Hey, c'mon, I'm pulling my punches here.

&gt;You should've heard what he said at Westercon in '98!  He said he
&gt;wouldn't believe in God until God put up a message in the sky, in huge
&gt;letters, saying "Come here, MF!" (I won't write it out, but you know
&gt;what the term is.)  It didn't go over well with some people, bu it made
&gt;me laugh (me &amp; my irreverent sense of humor!).

Yeah, but I also ended with, "But I'd *still* like to see where that neon
sign's plugged in."
