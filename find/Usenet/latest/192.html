<H2>Re: CRUSADE Rumor</H2>
10 Nov 1999<PRE>&gt;The rumor is that Sci-Fi is negotiating with TNT to do some sort of
&gt;one-time special CRUSADE marathon.  All the episodes would be shown back
&gt;to back, and if the ratings were high enough to please the Skiffy Suits,
&gt;talks would begin for possible purchase of CRUSADE by Skiffy.
&gt;

It's news to me, so I doubt its authenticity.  Also, they'd have to factor into
the equation that the episodes have just run on TNT recently, so a lot of folks
have seen 'em.
