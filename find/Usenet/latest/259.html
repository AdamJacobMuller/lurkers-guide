<H2>Re: 2 Questions about "Sleeping in Light"</H2>
20 Dec 1999<PRE>&gt;When Shariden was talking to Franklin and said that Delenn was grey
&gt;concil in training if not in fact what did he mean?

That she had been trained as Grey Council, and that even though she was no
longer a member of the Council, hence not a member in fact anymore, that
training was still much in evidence.

&gt;Vir signing something with a Ranger was the Ranger Zack Allen?

It was Zack but he wasn't a Ranger, he was an advisor/counselor to the throne.
