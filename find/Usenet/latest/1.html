<H2>Re: Elia Kazan</H2>
3 Mar 1999<PRE>&gt;I find it rather grimly amusing that those who profess the
&gt;greatest horror at "The Black List" now demand that Elia Kazan
&gt;remain blacklisted, forty years later, and get indignant, bent
&gt;out of shape, and even violent at any cracks in *that* black list.

Langauge and words have specific meaning.

To be blacklisted means that you cannot work, cannot pursue your livelihood.

Kazan has worked successfully for his entire life.

Further, most of those prosecuted under the blacklist were totally innocent and
never did the things they were accused of doing.  No one has ever said that
Kazan didn't name names.
