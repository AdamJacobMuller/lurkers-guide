27 Nov 1999<PRE>&gt;   On the other hand, the listing announcing "Rising Stars" #5 for 
&gt;January 2000 was decidedly different:
&gt;   The unknown issue! Tempers reach an all time high as deadline
&gt;     crunches weigh heavy on the shoulders of all! Atist, inker and
&gt;     colorist are still unknown but JMS will still deliver one heck of
&gt;     a story. Soon to be lengthened into a 900 page novel, grab
&gt;     yours today. Peace!
&gt;
&gt;What's *that* all about?
&gt;

I've no idea, since the script for #5 was turned in *ages* ago.  In general,
the scripts have stayed 3 issues ahead of the publishing schedule.  And even
before it was turned in, I provided TC with a synopsis of the story for use in
solicitations.
