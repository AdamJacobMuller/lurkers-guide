26 Nov 1999<PRE>No, I understand the motivation and whence it comes; on a much higher plane,
it's the kind of stuff that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle had to deal with after he
sent Sherlock Holmes over the falls of Reichenbach, after Dickens dispensed
with some of his characters...so I do understand it.

And thanks.
