<H2>Re: ACtA/crusade: War Zone *spoilers*</H2>
15 Jun 1999<PRE>&gt;i've seen some people(not sure if here or un unmod) posting about
&gt;inconsistancies between the end of ACtA, and the beginning of crusade, and
&gt;while there is at least one(dureena acting like the excalibur is new to her)

Actually, she never gives that impression; her reaction to the others seeing
the ship and being impressed is to shrug and say, "It'll do."  She's not
impressed because she's already been there.
