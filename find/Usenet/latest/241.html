4 Dec 1999<PRE>&gt;How will this effect your writing workload?  More novels and/or short
&gt;prose stories?  Maybe another comic series?

There's still plenty to do, and several other projects in the works while the
project I was doing for Chris is being shopped elsewhere.

Believe me, I never lack for stuff to work on.
