26 Oct 1999<PRE>&gt;::sigh:: yes, but a book you can re-read at leisure without the distraction
&gt;of
&gt;commercials.

That's why god made VCRs.

&gt;BTW, I enjoyed "We Killed Them in the Ratings".
&gt;

Thanks...I don't do that many mainstream stories, but that was one I enjoyed
(if only to take a shot at TV in general).
