21 Sep 1999<PRE>&gt;Major nosey questions:  Have you ever been personality typed?  what were the
&gt;results?  What did you think of them?

The one time I took a career-oriented personality inventory, it said I was best
suited to be an officer in the Army.  I think running a production company
comes in right about there.

Other than that, pretty much stayed clear of them...once had an IQ test that
put me in the genius category (was in Mensa for about a year before I ran
screaming out the door)...other than that, frankly, I think I'd rather not
know.
