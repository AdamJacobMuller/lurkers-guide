1 Jun 1999<PRE>Further on this point, I got the following today from John Freeman, editor of
the B5 magazine.

Text follows:

Joe 
(Hope you can forward this if you think it necessary... I checked with our
distributor and the rumour is pure hogwash....)

Further to your response below I can confirm that Eastern News, our news
stand distributor in North America, is actively seeking to increase our news
stand (i.e. Barnes and Noble, etc.) sales. We're experiencing an upswing in
sales, but it's more evident in the direct sales market. BTW, in a complete
reversal of the situation in the UK, direct sales shops are more likely to
have Babylon 5 on their shelves faster than news stands.
One area we are still trying to sort out is setting up  a North American
subscription house, which has taken much longer than we would have liked,
largely because we are a non-US magazine company. However, I hope that
particular 'nut' will be cracked very soon now - the paperwork has been
incredibly complex.
I would like to thank North American readers for their patience and
enthusiastic support, evidenced by the growing size of my B5 mailbag!
Best wishes
John Freeman
