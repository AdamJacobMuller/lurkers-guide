<H2>Re: B5 Awards listing?</H2>
9 May 1999<PRE>Let's see...this is from memory.

Two Vision awards from the Space Frontier Foundation.

Emmys forEFX and makeup.  

A bucket of reader's choice awards from SFX magazine, Sci-Fi Entertainment and
others.

Two Hugo awards.

(If you put the personal ones in the mix, you'd add the Bradbury Award and the
Inkpot Award.)

The American Cinema Foundation award.

And others that have momentarily slipped my mind.
