16 Aug 1999<PRE>&gt;Aren't any of those folks still around, and if so, aren't they really ticked
&gt;off at TNT management for damaging (possible irreparably) that potential???
&gt;

The problem in some measure is that there is an ongoing power struggle between
WB and TNT (WB owns TNT, but the biggest shareholder in WB is Ted Turner).  And
nobody -- I mean *nobody* -- wants to get caught in the switches on this one.
