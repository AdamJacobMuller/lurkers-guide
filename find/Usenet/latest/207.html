<H2>Re: JMS: Selling B5 Scripts &amp; Pricing</H2>
21 Nov 1999<PRE>&gt;So we must spend $20 a script on thestation.com for a B5 script...
&gt;
&gt;just thought you'd be interested to know that for $20 you can buy a
&gt;multimedia CD which includes ALL 175 Deep Space Nine scripts along with
&gt;their video promos.  Same thing for Next Generation.  Why didn't you do
&gt;this?

First, is this CD by any chance licensed?  

Second, that is the going price for actual, physical scripts.  Go to any other
place in town, X-Files, or a script store, and that's the going price to get an
actual script.  Lots and lots of folks don't want just a CD, they want the
physical script.  I can get all of an Mark Twain's books on CD, but I *prefer*
to buy them in book form.

Third, these are collectibles whose value is more than just the paper.

If you don't get that concept, there's nothing I can do that will explain it to
you.
