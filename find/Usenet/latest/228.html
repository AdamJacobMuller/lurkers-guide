28 Nov 1999<PRE>&gt;So to my mind, the B5 universe is closed fer business. It's as you wanted:
&gt;a good story, nothing more or less, to be re-read from time to time when
&gt;the real world isn't too appealing, up on the shelf with all the other
&gt;classics. 

&gt;Thanks for everything, from pilot episode to release of original scripts
&gt;and bibles. Thanks for a good time. Ciao.

You're welcome.
