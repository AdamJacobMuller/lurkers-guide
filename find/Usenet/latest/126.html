19 Sep 1999<PRE>&gt;Don't you get tired of the 'I can't discuss it yet' and the 'I can neither
&gt;confirm or deny that' and the showing of a neutral or optimistic face for the
&gt;sake of the project even though it's gone to hell in a handbasket?  The
&gt;political crap seems that it would grind you down and sand off your
&gt;integrity.
&gt;How do you deal with it?

I don't, basically, as the whole TNT situation makes fairly evident.  I'm
simply not a political creature.  My life would be eminently simpler and less
stressful if I *were*, but I ain't.  I go for the philosophy of "Be sand, not
oil, in the machinery of the world."

The peculiar thing about it is...by all rights I should be hard-core
unemployable.  But any time I become available, the phone rings...people who
work with me invariably come back to work with me again,fully knowing that I'm
a major-league pain in the ass.  I think the reason they do so is because they
know that I'm *not* political, that whatever some might say the truth is that
when I show up at the office in the morning, I check my ego at the door and
everything I do, I do if I sincerely believe it's the best thing for the show,
and the story.

Somehow, it works.  Damned if I understand it.
