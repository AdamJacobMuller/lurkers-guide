13 Sep 1999<PRE>&gt;So, knowing how tough it is to make a living in *Hollywood,* your saying
&gt;simply
&gt;because someone makes their primary living as a professional wrestler YOU
&gt;would
&gt;preclude an individual from consideration for a role? I really do not believe
&gt;you're that shallow and superficial.

Yes, I would, if it were done as a mandate from a studio as a ratings gimmick
rather than for a legitimate story reason.

As usual, your reasoning is specious.
