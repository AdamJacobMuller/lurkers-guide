<H2>Re: More comments, and a question</H2>
16 Jan 2000<PRE>&gt;All my friend wants is an
&gt;honest, balanced representation of her religion, and not one where the only
&gt;person who seems to have any faith in Rising Stars is a zealot. 

1) Not every single so-called religious person is a good person, as Jimmy
Swaggart and his ilk have shown.  I portray that which is appropriate to the
story.  Having done some very even handed stuff on religion on B5, I don't feel
I have anything to prove on this issue.

2) If fairness is an issue with her, may I expect that she will solicit an
honest, balanced representation of atheism from the pulpit of her church
sometime soon?
