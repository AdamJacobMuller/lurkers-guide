<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: What about The Further Adventures of Lyta and G'Kar?</H2>
16 Mar 1999<PRE>I'm writing 3 B5 short stories for Amazing Stories magazine; the first is a
Londo (shortly after he became emperor) story; also doing a G'Kar/Lyta story,
and a B5-setting story, all following these characters after the events of
"Objects at Rest."
