9 Nov 1999<PRE>&gt;Well, no speaking role, and really, who better to be the one to pull the last
&gt;switch to shut down B5?
&gt;
&gt;

Besides, it was supposed to be a *surprise*.  There's a qualitative difference
between talking about what's happening, and something planned for down the road
(if I had the courage at the last to do it, which I was never sure about).
