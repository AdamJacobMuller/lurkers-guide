16 Jan 2000<PRE>&gt;One thing that is probably out of your hands somewhat is the loooonnnng
&gt;time between issues.  

Actually, TC is really getting that part together; 4 came one month after 3,
and we just locked down the pencils and inks on 5, so that's heading toward
hitting the next deadline, or damn close to it.

Five, by the way, is probably the strongest issue of the bunch, and definitely
kicks over the table on the storyline.
