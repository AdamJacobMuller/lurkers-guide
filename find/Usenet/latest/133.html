<H2>Re: Hugo for Y2K??? Attn JMS</H2>
21 Sep 1999<PRE>&gt;I have a ?, since Sleeping in Light was not seen in Australia at the time of
&gt;the Hugo award presentation. Will it be eligible for consideration in Y2K??
&gt;

Thanks for the kind words elsewhere.  To your question...no.

The only B5 stuff that will be eligible would be A Call to Arms, The River of
Souls, and Crusade stuff.
