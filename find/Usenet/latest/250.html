<H2>two quickies (from jms)</H2>
14 Dec 1999<PRE>Forgot two points in my Various note...encroaching senility, I suppose....

1) Many folks have sent me email asking when Rising Stars #3 comes out...it
actually came out about a week ago.  So it's still out there, though copies are
starting to get hard to find.

2) For folks who are mainly planning to stay home New Year's Eve and watch the
apocalypse happen on national TV...a special 2 hour edition of 48 Hours airs
that night, with the Future being its topic.  Oddly, they thought I might have
a thing or two to say about it, so in theory (at least until they develop the
film and see the true horror that is joe), I'm supposed to be in a segment or
two of the thing.
