27 May 1999<PRE>&gt;Is it true that that the Babylon-5 magazine is suffering a drop in sales and
&gt;is in danger of no longer being carried by some national chain bookstores
&gt;such
&gt;as "Barnes and Noble?

Nope.  If anything, the magazine has been increasing a bit in size and scope
because sales are solid and increasing, allowing that to happen.

There are always some folks out there spreading this stuff...they've been doing
it for years.  They get off on it.  All anyone has to do is *look* at the
magazine to see how it's doing.
