<H2>Re: Attn:JMS-Biography</H2>
16 Mar 1999<PRE>&gt;I have just read "the last word" in this months B5 magazine and i was
&gt;glad to see you writing about yourself for a change.I found it a   very
&gt;interesting if brief insight into the man behind the story.

Thanks, I'm always leery about that, and try to keep a low profile in that
respect.

&gt;I was wondering if you would ,at some point in the future,consider
&gt;writing your biography, as i am sure a great many people would be very
&gt;interested.

I dunno...I've actually been asked to write one, but have so far declined; it
just ain't that interesting a life in many respects, and I'm only 44, writing a
bio at this point would be rather self-indulgent.  I guess -- and I'm not being
fascetious here -- I can't imagine anything less exciting to read than my bio.
