<H2>Re: Attn: JMS ... permission?</H2>
6 Jan 2000<PRE>&gt;Basically, I'm asking you now if we have your permission to "play" with
&gt;your characters in B5 fanfic?  I just wouldn't feel right doing it if
&gt;you said no.

I can't give permission because WB owns the rights to those characters, not me.
 And I think they would still view it as a form of copyright infringement.
