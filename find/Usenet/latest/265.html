<H2>Re: airdate correction</H2>
31 Dec 1999<PRE>I was even more incorrect than I thought; apparently (given a phone call today
from CBS), they thought the piece was important enough to justify pulling it
out and making it a stand-alone piece on its own.  It's going to air twice,
once Sunday morning, once I think Monday (I'll have to check the message
later); the longer version of the two runs about 8 minutes.

More as I get specifics.
