&gt;Can you tell us a little bit about the way you write your storys?
&gt;
&gt;How do you get your ideas for stories and characters and how do you handle
&gt;them?

I always start with character.  Character gives you plot; if you start with
plot and try to back your way into characater, you can go afoul very easily.

You have to know who your character is, what he wants, how far he will go to
get it, and how far someone else will go to stop him.  Answer those questions
and 90% of the plotting work is done for you.
