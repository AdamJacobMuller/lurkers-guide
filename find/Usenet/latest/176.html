29 Oct 1999<PRE>&gt;Then, since hindsight is 20/20, it appears you should have sold Crusade to
&gt;TNT as being as B5-like as possible.  Ties to the known commodity could only
&gt;have helped here (e.g. B5 actors guest appearing on Crusade often). 

Except at first TNT said they wanted NO connection to B5, or as little as
possible, because they wanted it to be THEIR show...then, after they began to
realize that the connection made sense (well into the writing process, I might
add), they said no, no, it's OKAY to have B5 stuff going on...which is why
Lochley is gone for so long.
