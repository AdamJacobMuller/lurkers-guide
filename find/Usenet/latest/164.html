21 Oct 1999<PRE>&gt;The meanings of the other season titles are pretty obvious:
&gt;Signs and Portents, The Coming of Shadows, etc.  But could
&gt;you give us any insight into the choice of "Wheel of Fire"
&gt;as the title for Fifth Season?

"For I am bound upon a wheel of fire, that my own tears do scald like molten
lead."  King Lear.
