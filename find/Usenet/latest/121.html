<H2>Re: Attn: JMS - Bryan Coney</H2>
16 Sep 1999<PRE>&gt;Umm, on another list, Bryan Coney just contradicted what I have heard
&gt;you say regarding eithe Wolf 359 or Vorcon, or both about some of the
&gt;cast members not getting paid for their appearance. I totally don't want
&gt;to take him on, but I would like to know if I read you correctly
&gt;regarding this issue. If not, or if the situation has been cleared up
&gt;since last November, I need to know. I would rather not getting into a
&gt;war of words with him. 

I was told, directly, by a number of cast members that they were most
emphatically *not* paid for their appearances at VorCon, or in other cases paid
only partially.  I have not heard anything to the contrary since then.  

Beyond that, I know that WB has initiated action against Cooney on a variety of
charges based on his convention activities, but that's all I know at this time.
 I don't really keep track of it because he's not worth the expenditure of
energy.
