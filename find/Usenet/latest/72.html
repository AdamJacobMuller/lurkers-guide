<H2>jms portland oregon query</H2>
9 Jun 1999<PRE>I have some family members who are looking for a retirement village or place in
the Greater Portland area (I'm told that Portlandians will know what that
means).  It should be a nice place, with the possibility of extending health
care or medical assistance, upscale is cool, middle of the road is cool, as
long as it's genuinely a nice place, decent sized, friendly, that sort of
thing.

They've been looking on their own, but haven't found anything, and I
figured...what the heck, I'd try this venue and see if anything came up.

Replies via email, no need to burden the forum with this, thanks.
