19 May 1999<PRE>&gt;There also seemed to be a "Rising Stars" 0 (zero) issue that was
&gt;distributed along with Wizard magazine...  Is this true?  If so, do you
&gt;know which issue of Wizard it was in? 

It's in the Top Cow issue with the Fathom cover, just came out about a month
ago, most stores should have it.  I'd actually suggesting reading that one
*first* since it sheds light on the preview issue.
