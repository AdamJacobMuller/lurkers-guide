&gt;And the prize our heroes win for resolving the crisis, the scientific
&gt;breakthrough that makes it all worthwhile, is the ability to infect
&gt;one's self with a reprogrammed alien biological warfare agent of
&gt;incredible sophistication - trust us, it's perfectly safe - in order
&gt;to avoid the indignity of wearing a filter mask for a couple of days.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;This is an idiot plot, pure and simple.

Funny...the microbiology experts at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory who vetted
the script thought it would be a) a useful thing indeed, and b) extremely
useful as a template in attempting to understand how the Drakh virus works.
