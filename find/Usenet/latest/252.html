15 Dec 1999<PRE>&gt;I can usually see where these groups are coming from (not agree with them,
&gt;but see where they are at - very important to remember that :-), but in this
&gt;case I can't even imagine what they might be on about...

Doesn't matter, and don't bother, because it ain't about the show, it's about
this group trying to garner publicity and attention by attacking TV shows, the
oldest and smarmiest trick in the book.
