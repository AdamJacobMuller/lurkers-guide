7 Oct 1999<PRE>&gt;Oh, out of curiosity, is there anywhere I can fins enough (good) information
&gt;to
&gt;make a report on you? It seems that they had to tell the teachers (what a
&gt;moron) and I've gotten a wonderful extra assignment. "make a report on that
&gt;person whom you heard that from".

I dunno, probably any of the grand jury hearings would suffice....

That apart, do a yahoo search...you'll get more than anyone would want to know.
