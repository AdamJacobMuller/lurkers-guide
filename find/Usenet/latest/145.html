<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: RealVideo Cruasde Episodes on the web</H2>
3 Oct 1999<PRE>&gt;Since TNT is almost certainly not going to rerun the Crusade episodes, and we
&gt;don't known when (or ever) we'll see them on video, would you give us the
&gt;permission to encode the Crusade episodes and put them up on the web, until
&gt;such
&gt;time as they become available to the audience in some other form?

No, because I can't give that permission, the show is owned by WB, and that
would be massive copyright infringement, and deny actors their residuals.
