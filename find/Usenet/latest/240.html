<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Characters Who Have Problems</H2>
4 Dec 1999<PRE>&gt;I've noticed, from watching B5 &amp; reading Rising Stars, that you tend to
&gt;write characters who have problems they need to overcome.  This is what
&gt;I like about your writing the most.  I've all ready mentioned my problem
&gt;with depression &amp; how B5 helped me to deal with it (along with therapy,
&gt;of course) here.  I also had to deal with OCD (obsessive-compulsive
&gt;disorder) along with it, so I had a tough time.  It's nice to see
&gt;characters who also face real problems on television &amp; in print.  So
&gt;thank you again!
&gt;
&gt;
Thanks...I don't believe in totally perfect people, we all have our flaws as
well as our virtues, and that's what makes us interesting, particularly from a
storytelling point of view.
