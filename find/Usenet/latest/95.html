22 Aug 1999<PRE>I hear this from time to time from folks, that they grew up on my work as kids
into adulthood.  (I started selling to TV in 1984, so that's...fifteen years.)

Suddenly I feel absolutely ancient....

On the other hand, if it causes some folks to grow up asking questions and
thinking about stuff, then it's a good thing and a service to the commonweal. 

Was it Emerson?  "Be ashamed to die until you have performed some service for
humanity."  It's just TeeVee...and there ain't much that's more trivial than a
TeeVee writer...but I do hope it's had an effect.
