4 Mar 1999<PRE>&gt;Was it your choice to cancel the series because you
&gt;felt it was being interfered with creatively, or did TNT cancel it because
&gt;you wouldn't do things their way?  

I do not have the power, authority or contractual ability to cancel a show and
take it elsewhere.  WB owns the show, lock stock and barrel.
