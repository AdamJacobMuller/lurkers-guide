<H2>Re: Attn JMS: Comments on KODO</H2>
13 Jan 2000<PRE>&gt;I get to see KODO perform live in LA on January 30th, and I'm just
&gt;jumping up and down inside at the prospect. I've seen them live several
&gt;times, and it just gets better and better each time. I'm doing the happy
&gt;dance right now, you will just have to trust me on this one.

Where are they performing?
