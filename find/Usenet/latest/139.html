24 Sep 1999<PRE>&gt;Anyone here surprised???  It didn't take me long watching B5 to realize that
&gt;about ya Joe.  
&gt;I'm glad you've used it for good.  Thanks for everything.
&gt;

Except, of course, that I don't believe it *means* anything.  At the very most,
it may be some kind of indicator for potential or intuitive thinking, but at
the end of the day it really doesn't mean anything; it's what you do with your
potential that matters, and person A with less potential can do 100 times more
than person B who had more potential but less *will*.
