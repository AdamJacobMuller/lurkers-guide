<H2>Re: JMS:  Synthetic Worlds?</H2>
20 Dec 1999<PRE>&gt;I just noticed a new addition to your online signature &lt;g&gt;.  Is Synthetic
&gt;Worlds your company?  Love the name.  Think the copyright will help?
&gt;

Synthetic Worlds, Ltd. is my personal company, which has been around for about
15 years, give or take.  (The credit appears on the original B5 pilot.)

As for the copyright info...I've freely given permission for my material to be
reposted to other groups, but NOT to anyone to put into magazines or books. 
One publisher lately had to redo his entire book because he tried to use my
material without permission.  Courts have ruled that internet postings are the
copyrighted material of the poster...and one can deny permission as much as
allow it.  So that's what I did.
