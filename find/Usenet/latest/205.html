<H2>Re: Crusade Jacket MIA?</H2>
20 Nov 1999<PRE>No, there's not a problem.  We wanted to wait until the last of the orders were
in, and then ship everything pretty much at once, which is easier for the
fulfilment house to deal with given the bulk of the items involved.

I think they've either stopped taking orders, or will stop shortly, so stuff
should go out soon.
