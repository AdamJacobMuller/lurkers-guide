11 Dec 1999<PRE>&gt;Yes, but stopping Crusade was a breach of contract with WB.  Why doesn't WB
&gt;yank
&gt;B5?  The shows might be different, but the owner and broadcaster are the
&gt;same.

You can't apply one situation against another; their license on B5 is solid and
by contract until the end of 2001 or thereabouts.  To pull B5 would breach WB's
contract with TNT, and they would be liable.
