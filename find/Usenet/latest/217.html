&gt;&gt; &gt; "&gt; &gt;Is there a chance to see you next year in London? In march there will
&gt;be
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the Starfury Millenium Con (no Wolf359 con AFAIK) with
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Peter, Andreas, Richard and Jason and some german B5 fans, too!
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; No, no plans for UK conventions next year, and would not be involved
&gt;with
&gt;&gt; &gt; this one in any event given some of the folks involved."
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; JMS, I hope it's not true, but that reply seems to imply that you have a
&gt;&gt; &gt; problem with Peter, Andreas, Richard, or Jason.  Again, I hope that's not
&gt;&gt; &gt; true, but I wouldn't expect you to explain why even if it is true.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I don't think he's referring to the actors, but rather the folks who
&gt;&gt; put on the con. ISTR some problems with one of the UK cons last year...
&gt;
&gt;AFAIK is there only a problem with Wolf359 (a UK Con runner) since the
&gt;Wolf359-Con "The Alliance" 1997 in Blackpool. I hope there is no general
&gt;problem from JMS visiting Cons in the UK.

Correct, I have no problems with the cast attending, or with the UK.  That
unpleasantness with Boston Harbor is long,  long forgotten....
