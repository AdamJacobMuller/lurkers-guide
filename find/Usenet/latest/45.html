<H2>jms = big rock</H2>
25 Apr 1999<PRE>Sent this a while back, but it never got on...

For those who are interested in these sorts of things, I learned recently that
Kitt Peak Observatory in Tuscon, Arizona, has just formally named an asteroid
discovered by them in 1992 8379 STRACZYNSKI in recognition of B5.  (This is the
formal designation, as per the Astronomical Union.)

Suffice to say it's a tremendous honor.

Finally, I'm a rock star....
