<H2>Re: attn: JMS</H2>
8 Mar 1999<PRE>&gt;I'm curious if you have seen the commercials for the movie "Wing
&gt;Commander". It opens with the narrator saying "Earth's Last Hope", and
&gt;he sounds so much like the narrator for Babylon 5. I wondered if you
&gt;would think this a compliment to your opening of Babylon 5.

No, I'm fine with it; it ain't like we copyrighted that phrase, and they
probably didn't think of us at all in that regard.  I'll certainly try to see
the film if I can, since I enjoyed the game.
