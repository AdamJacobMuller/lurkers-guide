<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Genie online service finally shut down</H2>
2 Jan 2000<PRE>&gt;I think you were still a member when I left in early 1996, when its
&gt;new owners yanked up the rates, driving off many long-time users. This
&gt;withered the content. Did you stay until the end?

Until they turned off the lights.

&gt;An aside: I recall that you appear regularly in a forum in CompuServe.
&gt;I have heard recently that owner AOL is making changes to CompuServe
&gt;that will make that service far less attractive to content providers
&gt;such as yourself.

If true that would be most unfortunate; it's been a good forum, and the one
I've been on the longest, since something like 1985.
