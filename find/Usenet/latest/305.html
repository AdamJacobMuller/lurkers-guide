<H2>Re: Voice in the Wilderness scripts</H2>
9 Feb 2000<PRE>I emailed Val, the current head of the fan club, concerning the few that have
had problems, and this was her reply:

**********8

"Joe

We are meticulous about padding our shipments.  We also replace damaged
bibles to everyone who notifies us of any problems.  This binding is not
cheap, it costs us $1.00 per unit plus labor in addition to duplication.
Unfortunately, if these customers don't make me aware of the problem I can't
rectify it.

I am more than happy to replace damaged items.  I understand that sometimes
despite padding and "Do Not Bend"
stamped all over the package the US Postal Service still sees fit to mishandle
packages.


Val"
