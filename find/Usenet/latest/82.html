15 Aug 1999<PRE>&gt;If Crusade doesn't come back (although I am really hoping it does
&gt;return), would you consider doing another B5 spinoff?  I love that B5
&gt;universe, &amp; the thought of no more of it (especially with how bad a lot
&gt;of the series are these days) makes me a bit sad.

No.

I like the B5 universe as well, but I would prefer to move on to other
projects, and not become a one-trick pony.  None of the other projects
currently in the works have anything to do with B5.
