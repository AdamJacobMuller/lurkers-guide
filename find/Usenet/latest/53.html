7 May 1999<PRE>&gt;Why did you not stand up
&gt;for yourself and protect your rights and property?

I could not do so; once the contracts were signed for B5, WB owned B5 lock,
stock and copyright.  They would have been the ones to have to sue Paramount,
and they were not up for doing that on an issue like this.
