<H2>Re: JMS:  Chronology question</H2>
23 Nov 1999<PRE>&gt;I'm really looking forward to the chronology in the upcoming B5 magazines.
&gt;Can
&gt;you tell us how it will be set up?  There are various 'canon' items that
&gt;weren't actually shown on screen (books, comics, magazines) and I wondered if
&gt;they will be included and annotated as to the source?  Also, how many issues
&gt;will it take?
&gt;
&gt;

I think it'll be stretched across 2-3 issues.  The thing can't quite be
explained as you've outlined the question here, it really kinda has to be seen.
 It incorporates a LOT of stuff from various sectors into a detailed timeline
that has been checked and cross referenced with our material to ensure its
accuracy.  It's real nifty.
