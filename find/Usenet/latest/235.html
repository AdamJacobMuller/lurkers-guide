<H2>Re: jms Tells the Chris Carter/CBS story at Loscon</H2>
1 Dec 1999<PRE>Just to jump in a bit...

The irony of course is that if Harsh Realm had been canceled even a week later,
we would've concluded the deal with CBS for the show I'd created and which
Chris, Frank Spotnitz and I would exec produce.  CBS had agreed to a pilot
production deal, and they were haggling over the per episode license fee should
the show get picked up for series when HR got canceled and the ripple effect
started.

The other thing I wanted to mention is that in my years in the biz, I have
rarely enjoyed a partnership with anyone as much as with Chris and Frank, who
are not only stand-up guys, but in all of our discussions I don't think a
single idea got broached that didn't make sense.  

Their approach is the same we had at B5: you check your ego at the door and do
what's best for the story.  I have nothing but good things to say about them,
and even though Fox felt that they needed to go forth only with 100% CC after
HR was canceled (the logic being that it didn't work because Chris didn't
actually create it), I consider the experience a positive one.

They're good people over there at 1013.
