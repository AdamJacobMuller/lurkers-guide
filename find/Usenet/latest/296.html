<H2>Re: JMS: Gil Kane</H2>
1 Feb 2000<PRE>&gt;Just got the word this afternoon about Mr. Kane's passing on. Heavy
&gt;mourning in progress on rec.arts.comics.misc and rac.dc.universe, by the
&gt;looks of it...

I hadn't heard this until now.  It's a terrible loss.  He was the one person
who could make the Atom *not* a silly character.
