2 Nov 1999<PRE>&gt;Do you know if Walter Koenig had a chance to read the "PSI Corps Trilogy",
&gt;and if he did, what does he think of Mr. Bester's fate?  After all,
&gt;other than yourself, he was probably was the one most involved with the
&gt;character.

I'm having lunch with him tomorrow...I'll ask.
