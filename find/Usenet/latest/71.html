<H2>jms on first eps</H2>
9 Jun 1999<PRE>Just for the record: I think the first one -- the only one written directly at
TNT's behest -- is probably the weakest one, certainly the one I find least
interesting.  It's lumbered with buckets of exposition, explaining things that
don't need explaining, too many fights, too many explosions, too much
swaggering around, all stuff the net wanted. 

Then we go back to the show we wanted to make...Path of Sorrows is terrific,
Well of Forever is a solid character story, The Long Road is just pure fun
(that's pretty much reverse broadcast order, btw)...there's one or two in the
bunch that are a bit slower than I'd like, but those are the exception rather
than the rule.  

Just to get my own feelings on this out there.
