<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Kosovo [off topic]</H2>
29 Mar 1999<PRE>I go back and forth on this whole thing.  On the one hand, I think the
atrocities against the Albanian population *have* to be answered, and they
*have* to be stopped, and the only voice the Serbian leaders seem to listen to
is the voice of force.  (Though so far that doesn't seem to have happened.)

On the other hand...I think there's a qualitative difference between this and,
say, bombing Iraq, which is very much isolated from its neighbors, and has no
desire to piss off its neighbors (for the moment and only for as long as it's
in its own interest not to).  Yugoslavia is dead center of a lot of other
countries into which this conflict could spill over into something considerably
larger and more dangerous.

Let's remember that WW1 began with a single gunshot in that region.

So bottom line...I dunno, I go back and forth on an almost hourly basis. 
Basically, I think either it'll work, or it'll start a massive war in a region
noted for a resentful populace and any number of leftover nukes.

Roll the dice....
