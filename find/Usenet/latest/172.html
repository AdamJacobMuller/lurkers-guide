<H2>Re: JMS: How do you work?</H2>
27 Oct 1999<PRE>&gt;I was just wondering in what kind of environment you work in.  At home?
&gt;In an office?  And if in an office, do you rent a permenant one
&gt;somewhere or something (since you're obviously not working in a
&gt;TNT-Crusade office).

Between shows, I work at my home office.  I travel light, don't have a lot of
folks working for me, it's just me, so there's no need to maintain an office
anywhere else.  I have a home office equipped with phone, fax, modem,
computers, reference books, music, TV, every distraction I could ask for.

&gt;And during B5/Crusade, where did you work?  Was
&gt;there like an office of writers or something (which of course would have
&gt;gotten lonely in Y3, 4, 5 !)? 

My office was in the B5 production building/studio in Sun Valley, at the end of
the hall, bordering the Wall of Death (a wall where all the generators and
power sources were, which was on the other side of the wall right behind
mydesk...and for a studio we're talking a LOT of power...I didn't think much of
it until we had an eletrician do an EMF sweep, came to the wall (where I sat
every day for 3 years) and literally paled.  HIs comment, "Jesus, you could fry
eggs over here."  So I moved to the other side of the office, and a lot of the
fatigue I'd had for the preceding couple of years faded.)

&gt;Did you live/work near the set where they
&gt;shot? 

Live, no...about 20 minutes away.  My office was about 15 feet from Stage C.

&gt;How much personal contact did you have with the actors?  Did you
&gt;ever watch them act/shoot the scenes?

Constant personal contact.  We'd eat together at lunch, I'd go by the stage
whenever possible (and often it wasn't) to watch scenes being shot, we
sometimes would get dinner or otherwise hang out.

&gt;And is your office extremely
&gt;cluttered or organized?

Yes.  It is extremely cluttered -- frighteningly so -- but I know where
everything is.
