<H2>Re: Attn jms: Are you letting Crusade die?</H2>
26 Aug 1999<PRE>&gt;It was my understanding that when WB let TNT out of their contract (a favor),
&gt;TNT agreed to relinquish their hold on show if WB could find another customer
&gt;(a return of the favor).
&gt;

Your understanding is most emphatically incorrect.  TNT would have had the
chance to get out of it had another network been found...no such deal having
been in place, the contract sticks, despite TNT's many attempts to get out
without paying any of the promised production budget.
