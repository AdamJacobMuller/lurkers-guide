<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Advice for budding writers???</H2>
11 Apr 1999<PRE>&gt;are you trying to say...it's impossible? :). I figured as much
&gt;already...but it seems like an endless circle. You cant get in w/o a
&gt;track record...but if you can't get in...then how do you get a track
&gt;record?

Of course you're proceeding from a false assumption.  New people get in every
year.  Every writer started out as an unknown, and not in the WGA, without a
track record.  You start trying to sell individual scripts to shows on the air
currently, then work your way up.

New members in the WGA are added every year, in substantial numbers.  Those
people all sold for the first time.  Happens all the time.

Not to flog my book...but go to your local library (cheaper that way) and check
out my Complete Book of Scriptwriting.  It may help.
