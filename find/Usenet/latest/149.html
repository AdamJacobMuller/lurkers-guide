5 Oct 1999<PRE>&gt;I liked the extra scene with Garibaldi &amp; the insectoid-alien.  Was this
&gt;cut for time?  I think it would've been really funny.
&gt;

We couldn't get the prosthetic to work right, so we never filmed it.  Unless
you read the script, there's no other way to know about it.

And yeah, Greg did a great job on the book.
