<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Phoenix Rising Series</H2>
20 Aug 1999<PRE>&gt;Some people seem to think that your new series is Phoenix Rising, a
&gt;possible new Star Trek spinoff.  I hope it isn't, because, for one
&gt;thing, it has the same title as one of your B5 episodes (&amp; I'm sure you
&gt;just hate that!).  Can you confirm or deny this rumor?

No, totally and completely untrue.  I don't know where this stuff comes from.

Some folks at Paramount have indicated privately that it'd be great if I could
take over the ST TV franchise but I have no interest whatsoever in doing that.
