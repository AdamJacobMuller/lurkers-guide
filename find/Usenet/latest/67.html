<H2>Re: Attn JMS: Funding Crusade (was Re: ATTN JMS: Third Psi-Corps</H2>
28 May 1999<PRE>&gt;Well it seems reasonable to me.  I assume if Sci-Fi had
&gt;picked up Crusade, they -- not TNT -- would have premiered
&gt;all 22 eps.

Also correct.  Nor was it being stated as a bad or a wrong thing...the only
point being that SFC would have to buy another 22 ep package at a time when
they'd already picked up 3 other 22 ep series, AND made a huge deal with
Spielberg in the $40 million range.  That's a lot for that net to bite off in
one season.
