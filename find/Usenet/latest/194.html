11 Nov 1999<PRE>&gt;BB-01A  Babylon 5 Autographed Bible  $45.00  
&gt;BB-01  Babylon 5 Bible   $35.00  
&gt;173-CB-01  Crusade Writers Bible  $20.00  
&gt;
&gt;Are the items in question?
&gt;

The Crusade bible is a different thing; it's the additional B5 treatment that's
being made available starting right now.  The Crusade bible was made available
a bit ago.
