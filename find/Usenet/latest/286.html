<H2>Re: JMS: Rising Stars questions</H2>
16 Jan 2000<PRE>&gt;1) Are you going to do a letter column in the comic?  I'm not too
&gt;familiar with Image/Top Cow's policy.  It appears some comics have a
&gt;letter column and others just have advertisements.
&gt;

We're discussing that now.

&gt;2) I've been searching the posts and haven't seen you state how long the
&gt;series is going to run. 

24 issues.

&gt; Are you really running Flagg's new name
&gt;in front of focus groups?  Do the readers get to write in and help pick
&gt;the new name?

Nope and nope.
