<H2>Re: rising stars #5 out 2/16</H2>
8 Feb 2000<PRE>&gt;Is this the way you've structured most of the story: each chapter having 
&gt;more punch and being better than the preceeding one?  Thus each one will 
&gt;be the best of the bunch when published?  Or are there to be peaks and 
&gt;troughs? (I realize any particula issue might span the range, generally 
&gt;from low to high...)

There are always peaks and valleys; the first bunch of Rising Star issues were
really establishing the rules and who some of the characters are; the fact that
the murders are going on, the possible motive, and introducing a bunch of
suspects.

Now all that pipe has been laid, and I can start to really move the arc of the
story forward, do more in present-tense than in flashback.  That's kind of
where the fun really kicks in.
