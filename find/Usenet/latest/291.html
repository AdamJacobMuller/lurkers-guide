<H2>Re: Rising Stars #4</H2>
16 Jan 2000<PRE>&gt;I think the confusion between the two comes because Pyre hasn't been
&gt;named, to my recollection, in any of the regular issues yet, and there's
&gt;a scene of him fighting Flagg, Jason, in #3 while in the midst of Lee's
&gt;story.  See one guy on fire in the middle of the story of another and
&gt;it's understanable that one might confuse the two.

Yeah, that's correct.  I'd wanted one panel in 3 that helped separate them out,
but it didn't quite come out the way I'd described, but we should clarify that
soon.
