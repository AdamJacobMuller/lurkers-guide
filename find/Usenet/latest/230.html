<H2>Re: Attn: JMS - Souls</H2>
28 Nov 1999<PRE>&gt;I think it's rather easy to define - a non-physical component of a 
&gt;person which is independant of their physical existence and still
&gt;incorporates all important elements of their personality such that
&gt;it would be unmistakeably unique.  (being non-physical it would
&gt;be undetectable and unaffected by any physical processes)

Except of course that this also defines *mind* just as well as it does *soul*. 
The mind exists IN the brain, as the soul reputedly exists IN the body, but you
can poke around someone's cerebral cortex all you want, you won't find *mind*.
