12 Sep 1999<PRE>&gt;Also, from what I understand, you have arranged for episode screenings at
&gt;conventions in the past ... was there any reason why no screening of *SiL*
&gt;was
&gt;setup for the convention prior to voting?

Because the voting is done long before the convention, by mail.  Clearly you do
not have any clear idea on the process.

&gt;That is their opinion and that is fine, however, the fact is that, honestly
&gt;speaking, season five IS generally hailed as the weakest and least satisfying
&gt;of the shows run.

So if somebody else says something, that's their opinion, but if you say it,
it's a fact, is that it?
