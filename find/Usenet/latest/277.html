<H2>Re: Attn: JMS - The Complete Book of TV Production?</H2>
6 Jan 2000<PRE>&gt;I was wondering if there are any plans for a companion tome to The Complete 
&gt;Book of Screenwriting that would deal with TV Production.
&gt;

I think it would probably be a less viable book in the marketplace since that's
a more specialized audience, so I don't know if I could make a go of it.
