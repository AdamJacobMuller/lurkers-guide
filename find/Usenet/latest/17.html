<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Can we help?</H2>
13 Mar 1999<PRE>&gt;Would letters from viewers help them to make this decision?  And, if so,
&gt;who should we write to?  One source suggests writing to Bonnie Hammer,
&gt;the Senior VP of Programming.   Also, Stephen Chao, the President of
&gt;Television and Marketing for USA

Yes, both those would be good choices.

And the best time for this would be after the episodes start airing in June.  I
think we have about 5 weeks before the actors' contracts expire in July.  (They
will be running all 13 straight through, or so they tell me.)
