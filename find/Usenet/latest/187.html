9 Nov 1999<PRE>&gt;"Will you ever do a cameo on Babylon 5?"
&gt;
&gt;     "No."
&gt;
&gt;Ahem.
&gt;

I said as straight as I can be about what happens in the show on the production
side to within my knowledge and ability.  That means mainly what happens behind
the scenes.  I a) consider the cameo to be a story thing, and b) what was I to
say to that question?  "Oh, yes, I intend to be in the last episode shutting
off the lights before B5 blows up"...?  That would be a massive spoiler.  And
it ain't the point.
