<H2>Re: Attn JMS: The Mars Missions</H2>
12 Dec 1999<PRE>&gt;In light of the recent failures of the Mars probes, I'm hearing
&gt;increased talk of cutting funds to NASA, launching Congressional
&gt;hearings, and just rethinking the whole space idea and/or strategy.
&gt;Your work and perspective are highly regarded by many at NASA, maybe
&gt;even Congress. As someone with a vision of space, is there anything
&gt;you can think of to say to these obviously frustrated people?
&gt;

Maybe if they'd *had* proper funding, instead of having to scrape by and
compromise things, the damned thing WOULD have landed intact.
