I already sent you an email to your Jmsatb5@aol.com addy, so I will not make 
this one tremendously long, because you'll have my other questions to answer 
if you can get to them :)

1.)  White Stars - did the Minbari actually have the ability to build more?  
I know that Delenn mentions around season 3 that the "First Wave" of White 
Stars have been built, yet around Season five, Sheridan's comments about 
"running out" eventually make it sound like they cannot build them anymore.  
Is this a case?

2.) Some discussion amongst some friends and I have centered around a 
definition for a "Defense grid."   Did you or anyone involved in B5 actually 
define what a defense grid is? (I know that, at least for EF, its 
interceptors and possibly ECM - is there more than just stealth or 
interceptors to a defense grid?  Some speculation has included "EM Fields" 
or "grav-fields" like some pseudo-shield technology, but I am wondering what 
you have to say on this.)

3.) Does ANY race on bablyon 5 use anti-matter based weaponry, or a type of 
reactor system?  I recall a quote from SEason five from Franklin dealing 
with the nature of weapons, and "disrupting" is mentioned, which is why i 
asked. Also, do Minbari employ some sort of "Forcefield" in their weaponry?  
I noticed that in In the Beginning, their tractor beams emitted from the 
weapons emittors it would seem, so I ask because of this.

4.) Vorlons and Shadows:  another discussion between me and some other 
people considered whether or not the shadows employed nanotechnology in 
their ships, rather than a more "biological" or "Cellular" approach for the 
Vorlons.  Further, I was wondering if Vorlon and Shadow technology each 
reflected their beliefs (The Vorlons favor a more "Evolutionary" approach - 
they keep most of the same tech over a long period but refine it to great 
degrees, making it more powerful, while the Shadows seem to appear to favor 
many new and different approachs.. more revolutionary.)

5.) Once in a comment you made reference to "gravimetric drives" on the 
White Star being based on magnetic and gravitic principles - is this 
something that you received from your tech advisors (JPL I think?)

6.) I've noticed that with the demise of Crusade, a large influx of novels 
seems to have started again...  is the B5 universe moving to a print media?  
Or have you considered this?  (By the way, have the Technomage books you 
mentioned Jeanne Cavelos, sorry If I misspelled her name, come out to your 
knowledge?  I really enjoyed book 7, and have been wondering.)

7.)  Just two verification notes, if you could.  In "Final Reckoning", we 
learn Lyta apparently is dead.   Did she die during the telepath war, and if 
so, was Bester involved?  (And do we learn in any way how she dies?)

Secondly, I ran across a note that you had made a interview in a magazine 
called "Dreamwatch" that talked about technomage technology, and had 
mentioned that the Shadows had "loaned" technology to the technomages, and 
if so, was ALL their technology shadow based, or did they have more beyond 
that (IE other technology from other races, or their own tech) and you had 
also mentioned that the reason the technomages left was to avoid repaying 
the debt.  I missed the issue, so I am just wondering if you had mentioned 
those things, and if there is anything you are allowed to add, or any 
summary that i might have neglected mentioning or got wrong.

<H2>jerry doyle runs for congress</H2>
18 Dec 1999<PRE>I'd heard this rumor the other day, and called Jerry to see if it were true or
not.  Well, he called back, and it's true.  He's running for US Congress in the
24th district, state of California (just north of the valley).  

I differ with Jerry on just about every one of his political views, always
have, but I think that his entering the race is great.  And while our views
differ, the thing about Jerry is that he talks straight and you always know
where he stands on an issue, no waffling.  So on that basis alone I think it'd
be great if he won.  I don't have to agree with his positions to respect their
origin, and the forthrightness with which they are expressed.

Go get 'em, Jer.
