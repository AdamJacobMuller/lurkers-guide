<H2>Re: JMS:  Why TV?</H2>
26 Oct 1999<PRE>&gt;With all of the media that you've worked in, why have you chosen to tell so
&gt;many of your stories on TV?  Isn't that awfully ephemeral for the breadth of
&gt;story you tell?  

It's an ephemeral medium but a pervasive one; it hits millions of people at a
time.  A best selling novel reaches 100,000 people or so; at its worst, the
average B5 episode was seen by 10 *million* people here in the US alone.  If
the task of the writer is to tell stories to the largest number of people, then
TV gives you that ability.

And why abandon such a powerful and pervasive medium to the visigoths?
