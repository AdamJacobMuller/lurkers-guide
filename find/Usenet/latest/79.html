<H2>Re: The Needs of Earth rating?</H2>
15 Aug 1999<PRE>&gt;I just noticed that "The Needs of Earth" has been given a TV-14(DS) rating
&gt;which is for sexual content and language.  Wasn't this one of the ones
&gt;written before TNT asked for more sex and violence in the show?  Has JMS
&gt;mentioned anything about this?  

No, this is actually pretty stupid...there's one shot where they think a nipple
is visible (it isn't, we were very careful in editing) and another where they
think a Eilerson says "goddamnit," but he doesn't.
