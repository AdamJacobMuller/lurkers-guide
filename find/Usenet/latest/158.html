8 Oct 1999<PRE>&gt;Almost as easy as it is to buy scripts from thestation, photocopy them and
&gt;sell copies or send them out on the internet after some OCR work, no?
&gt;
We're talking hours of work in the latter scenario, as opposed to 30 seconds to
download.  Thievery always happens, but you want to make it as difficult as
possible.

And photocopying a work into a scanner is a much clearer violation of copyright
for purposes of prosecution than transferring something already in file form.
