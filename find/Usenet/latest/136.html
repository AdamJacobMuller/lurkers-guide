<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Grimjack?</H2>
22 Sep 1999<PRE>&gt;I just remembered...it's been about...um...six years (what a
&gt;coincidence...) since you've mentioned the Grimjack screenplay you were
&gt;working on at one time.  Was there any further development on that?  Or
&gt;is it safely tucked into the back of a drawer somewhere?

There was a rights problem between the writer of the comic and the publisher
which could not be resolved; hence, it never got written.
