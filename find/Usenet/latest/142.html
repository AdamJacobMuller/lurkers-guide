<H2>RISING STARS #2 OUT THIS WEEK</H2>
2 Oct 1999<PRE>Just wanted to let folks know that the new issue hits the stands this week. 
It's a little mystery story about how one goes about eliminating someone who is
invulnerable...and how being invulnerable doesn't solve all your problems, and
how you get by and get a job and live a life when nothing can touch you.

It's kinda cool.
