<H2>Re: JMS: a new(?!) Crusade future question (spoil?)</H2>
13 Sep 1999<PRE>&gt;I know that 3 Crusade scripts were written but not produced (To the Ends
&gt;of Earth, Value Judgements, The End of the Line).  I've heard you
&gt;respond maybe I'll put Crusade into novels, etc.  My question:  will you
&gt;somehow release these 3 already made scripts?  now that's something I'll
&gt;shell $20 bucks a pop for! 

Dunno...haven't decided yet.
