<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: B5 Synchronicity</H2>
18 Aug 1999<PRE>&gt;Many times when I go by the machines, they will call out "B5".  It's so
&gt;weird because some nights, it happens several times!
&gt;
&gt;Anyone else have some weird B5 concidences?

One odd thing...seems like any time I have to leave Burbank airport, I end up
going out of and returning in via gate B5.
