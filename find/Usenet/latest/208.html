&gt;
&gt;That should be enough space.  (maybe more than enough LOL).
&gt;
&gt;What I enjoyed most was seeing how you moved some of the pieces of
&gt;peoples lives around.  I can't find it know but one of your suggested
&gt;stories was Garibaldi talking with his father in the hospital, not
&gt;Ivanova.  Or the fact that you mentioned in the bible Franklin was
&gt;divorced with two kids, that didn't come out in the show (to my
&gt;recollection).  So many ideas to play with, so little TV time to show
&gt;it.
&gt;

The first was a story that Larry looked at in the treatment and suggested would
be better given to Ivanova since Garibaldi had already had a lot of
character-related exposure.  And as for the latter...I didn't get a chance to
bring it up early on, and finally vetoed the thing as laying in too many
threads, especially since an ex-wife would end up playing significantly in the
Sheridan thread.
