<H2>Re: attn JMS: new Show - future of CRUSADE and BABYLON 5</H2>
15 Sep 1999<PRE>&gt;My friend is a big Dragon Riders of Pern fan and told me that he saw
&gt;an interview with Anne McAffrey. She stated that there was Babylon 5
&gt;writer who was coming over to write the Pern series.  That leaves me
&gt;with two possible writers: JMS or Fiona Avery.

Nope.  It's probably Larry DiTillio, who is a big fan of Anne's, and was our
story editor for 2 seasons (and is a perfect choice for the job).
