<H2>Re: Authorized Scripts for sale at NASFIC</H2>
25 Aug 1999<PRE>&gt;I wonder if there' s way to flip through them first? It might be good, but
&gt;the
&gt;televised versions of her previous scripts on Crusade were pretty bad. 
&gt;

When thsi script came out (going for sale at Fiona Avery's table at 11:30
Friday at NASFIC), Walter Koenig drove all the way across town specifically to
say how much he loved it...he went on to memorize huge sections of it long in
advance, and even performed sections of it in front of folks at at least one
convention (as reported by several SF magazines) and apparently wowed them with
it.
