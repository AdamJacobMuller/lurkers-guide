<H2>JMS: B5 Editorial: Lamentable</H2>
27 Jul 1994<PRE>     And just let me underline this again, on the "the sole motivation
of this is money" (like Paramount produces ST because they think it'll
cure cancer)....
 
     The Babylon 5 production company received no money from either of
these companies.  Okay?
 
     If your "reviewer" is going to start making charges like that, he had
better learn to get his facts straight.
 
     Second, on the notion that current companies won't be around 200
years from now...there are companies here in the US that go back to the
1700s; there are companies overseas that go back 500 years or more.
 
     This is as absurd as saying, in the 1800s, that by gosh, that
Guiness company in Dublin won't last past the end of the century....
 
                                                                       jms
