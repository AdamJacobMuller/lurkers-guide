<H2>I want to see some B5 stuff so</H2>
24 Jul 1994<PRE>     We kinda sat on merchandising for the first year; now there's a bit
coming out.  Shirts, mugs and stuff from Creation (and others, whose
names escape me at the moment), a CDROM in the winter from Compton's, a
CD soundtrack around November, a comic from DC and some original novels
from Dell (first one by John Vornholt).  Trying to keep it manageable to
maintain quality control over the stuff.
