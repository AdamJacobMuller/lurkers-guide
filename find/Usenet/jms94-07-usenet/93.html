27 Jul 1994<PRE>     RE: Coke being more "reasonable" in Blade Runner because it's
closer...that doesn't seem to be the point of the original post.  It's
ANY "commercial product" in a show that ruins it.  Extrapolation doesn't6
seem to enter into it.  Which is what makes it, in my view, a doofus note.
