<H2>Eyes--maybe a 5. JMS a child o</H2>
15 Jul 1994<PRE>     Sorry, but I don't agree with you about the characters being one
dimensional.  (Big surprise.)  Londo...sometimes comic figure, sometimes
tragic figure, in later episodes sometimes hero, and later still,
something much darker.  G'Kar...much the same, but never at the same
time.
 
     As far as government types go...in the episode you cite, we show a
Psi Corp rep who was *not* an evil type or an asshole.  In "Survivors" we
showed a government agent -- the head of presidential security -- who was
in fact not a baddie at all.  Had some issues, but was at heart okay.
 
     I could point to the Soul Hunter, who was doing what he believed was
right, which others believed was a horror.  I could point to "Believers,"
which was nothing BUT shades of grey.
 
     How can you say that the show demonstrates all government employees
as being evil or stupid when, after all, our main human characters are
themselves employees of the government?
 
     I could go on and on and on...but don't really see much point to it.
 
                                                                     jms
