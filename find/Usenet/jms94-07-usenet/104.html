29 Jul 1994<PRE>     RE: the big bridge shot...the storyboard artist came up with 3 shots
we could use.  One of them was a wide shot across a crystalline ground
like area, through which a path can be seen at ground level, but it
was narrow and still really didn't convey the scale of what I wanted.  One
other was not much different.  The third was a downshot designed to pull
back, and though I knew it would make folks say "Krell!", I knwe that it
was the right shot for that scene, so chose that one and decided to live
with it.
