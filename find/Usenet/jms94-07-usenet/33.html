<H2>A problem with S&amp;P</H2>
11 Jul 1994<PRE>     I hate to burst your bubble, but the Raider ship *was* rotating.
Look at it again.  It's most visible when the ship is being photographed
from behind with B5 in the background.  You can see the round part of the
ship rotating (with the docking bay at center).
