<H2>JMS:  Please, NOOOOOOO!</H2>
12 Jul 1994<PRE>     This is getting vastly misrepresented.  What we're doing, which is
something I noted here a long time ago, is trying to balance stuff a
little.  We did a *great* job, I think, creating the alien characters; so
much so that our human characters kinda got short shrift over the course
of the first season.  Year Two will show us a bit more of the humans on
the station; that is NOT the same as downplaying the aliens, and we're
most emphatically NOT doing that.  In point of fact, *all* of the major
alien characters will be appearing (by contract) in more episodes than
was the case last year.  Even the diplomatic attaches like Vir and Lennier
go from 6-7 episodes last year to 13 this coming year.
