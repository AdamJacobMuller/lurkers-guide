<H2>Re: "Eyes" too much like TNG</H2>
18 Jul 1994<PRE>     Re: Sinclair/Garibaldi/Ivanova basically liking each other; this will
tend to stay, for many reasons.  One of the things that grates on mhy
nerves about some dramatic TV is that they invent phony tensions and
reasons for the main characters to bitch at each other, that generally
don't mean a lot.  Also, we see a lot of conflict in other shows, but not
a whole lot of what *friendship* means.  And loyalty.  These three are
friends, as well as co-officers; they will go to bat for one another, will
if necessary die for one another.  I find that a lovely emotion.  There are
plenty of others who argue with them, and plenty of other shows in which
the main characters yell at each other all the time; why not explore the
other end of the spectrum?
 
     I will grant you that this is one of the more idosyncratic parts of
the show; I have always placed a very high premium on friendship...my
friends know that they can call me at midnight, and even if they're on the
other side of the country, or the planet, I'll be there on the first
plane if they're in trouble.  And I know I can do the same with them.  For
some reason friendship, and loyalty, have become kind of passe in TV, and
movies, and many other areas, as I think of it.  So for me, this becomes
something worth communicating.
 
     Bear in mind, though, that after this season, Sinclair goes elsewhere,
and suddenly there's a new dynamic introduced into the show, which no one
is entirely sure how to deal with.  It disrupts them, and that is for the
good, I think, as they try and work it out and decide whether or not they
can trust one another.
