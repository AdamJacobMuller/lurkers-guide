17 Jul 1994<PRE>      I don't at this point know when the series will be out on disk; my
guess it that it won't happen until a third year, when there will be
enough at one time to make the transfer process from standard-screen to
original-format widescreen more financially reasonable; do it all in
bulk.
 
     Ironheart blew out the Omega starfuries.
 
     And more money for Caitlin wasn't the problem.  She wants to do
more feature films as a leading lady, rather than being a face behind a
mask.  It's that simple.
