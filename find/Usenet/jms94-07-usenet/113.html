<H2>Voice in the Wilderness CGI</H2>
30 Jul 1994<PRE>     The CGI are definitely getting better.  Year One was more or less
getting used to the software and learning what was capable.  They've now
gotten more sophisticated in their use of the equipment, more artistic
in some ways...and the preliminary renderings I've seen for stuff in the
beginning of year two is *very* cool.  It has even more of a sense of
mass, and weight, and solidity.
