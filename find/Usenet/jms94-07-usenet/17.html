<H2>Re: Grail SPOILERS</H2>
8 Jul 1994<PRE>     Actually, no, the "forgery" story with the elderly couple didn't
hold up, because repeating the steps they took didn't replicate the
other crop circles.  The stalks are bent, never broken, a counter-
clockwise section beneath a clockwise section, the stalks continue to
grow, and the bend seems more from heat than pressure.  The forgery story
was itself a fake, and has been largely discredited.  Not to say that
there isn't some other way of doing it, but that ain't it, and thus far,
no one has been exactly capable of duplicating a proper crop circle.
