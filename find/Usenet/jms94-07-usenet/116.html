30 Jul 1994<PRE>     The Psi question I can't answer at this point in time.
 
     Jumpgate travel usually requires a few days within hyperspace,
if you're going a LONG distance (say, Earth to B5).  Only a few minutes
if you're going to a local gate.  That's time outside hyperspace; the
span seems less when you're inside hyperspace.
