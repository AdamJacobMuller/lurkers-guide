<H2>Attn: JMS: Local TV Stations</H2>
19 Jul 1994<PRE>     We do what we can with the stations, which ain't much.  Regarding
future stuff...any time information is needed from prior episodes in a
current episode, that information is *always* restated somewhere in the
current episode, so it doesn't matter really if you miss a prior episode,
you can follow it just fine.
