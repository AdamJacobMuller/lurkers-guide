<H2>Re: JMS: B5 Editorial: Lamenta</H2>
28 Jul 1994<PRE>     Do not twist my words around.  I don't like it.
 
     When I said that Zima making it to 1995 was "hysterical," I was not
making fun of people or kids who are or become alcoholics.  I grew up in
an alcoholic family, and there is *nothing* whatsoever funny in that, nor
was that intended in my message.  It was strictly a comment about the
product probably not making it past 1994.  Period.  Don't go off on
tirades against my message that have nothing to do with what i wrote, and
then try and blame it on me.  That's not what I said, not what I wrote,
not what was meant.
