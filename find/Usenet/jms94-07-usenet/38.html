<H2>Attn: JMS  What do you want?</H2>
12 Jul 1994<PRE>     We'll continue to work at intensifying the relationships across
the coming episodes.  "Eyes" does a lot, as do several more upcoming
episodes.
 
     As for "What do you want?" Morden...yes, he is a very significant
character, and yes, you will be seeing him again.
