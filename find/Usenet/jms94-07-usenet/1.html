<H2>DC Comics B5?</H2>
2 Jul 1994<PRE>     We are trying to keep the B5 comic part of B5 continuity and canon,k
though without the requirement that you have to read it to follow the
show, because that would be vastly unfair.  It just *fits*.  I.e., we
establish a prior relationship with a woman on Mars for Garibaldi, and she
can show up in flashbacks in the book, or in the present.  And yes, there
is complete freedome to use Sinclair in the books since he's not entirely
gone from the storyline at all, and still will carry a part.
