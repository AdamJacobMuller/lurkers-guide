<H2>EYES &lt;possibly spoilers&gt;</H2>
9 Jul 1994<PRE>     As story editor, Larry's job is to get it right as much as possible,
and keep the dialogue natural to the characters once created.  He's good
at this, which is why I work with him.
 
     And yes, Janet is a *great* director, and will probably do the first
episode of year two for us.  We think she's nifty.
