<H2>Question about Sinclairs statu</H2>
13 Jul 1994<PRE>     Is it a conflict of interest...yes and no.  Sinclair functions much
as a military governor in, for instance, California's past.  Someone in
this position may speak on behalf of his government with neighboring
countrires, and represent others.  Does it sometimes lead into a conflict
of interest?  Yes.  Is it sometimes unfair?  Yes.  Which is kinda like
life, and that's why I rather like putting him in an awkward position.
