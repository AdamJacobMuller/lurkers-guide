<H2>Re: SURROUND Sound.....Oh yeah</H2>
24 Jul 1994<PRE>     Just for clarification, while Chris does a great job on the music,
the sound mix is done in the studio with our regular sound guys, who do
the surround mix.  We spend a *lot* of time getting the mix to sound
just right, to take full advantage of the surround channels.  A lot of the
credit here goes to George Johnsen, our co-producer, who is an absolute
perfectionist about this stuff.
