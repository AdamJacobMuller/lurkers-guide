<H2>Ninja likely *not* paid for</H2>
16 Jul 1994<PRE>     Correct; Kawasaki did not pay us a dime to use the bike in the show.
We called around, to see who would loan us a bike, with the understanding
that we'd be tearing it apart.  Because Kawasaki does advertise with some
of the PTEN shows, someone there had a relationship with the company, and
gave us a name.  After we tried a couple of other companies, we tried
Kawasaki, and they agreed...not a donated bike, just a loaner.  And
that's what we used.
