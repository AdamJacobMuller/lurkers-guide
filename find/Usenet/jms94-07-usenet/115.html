<H2>JMS: San Diego ComicCon Appear</H2>
30 Jul 1994<PRE>      Thank you for putting this note up; I wanted to post one myself, but
am still unsure how to send an original message (not a reply) from GEnie
to Internet.  That said....
 
     In addition to whatever panels I'll be on, I will be doing *two*
Babylon 5 presentations at the San Diego Comic Con this coming weekend
(August 7-10).  The first will be that Friday, from 2-4 p.m.  The second
will be the next day, Saturday, from 11-1.
 
     At this point, the only cast member who may or may not be able to
show up at either panel is Bill Mumy.  No others are planned.  So it may
be just me at both.  The presentations will be a bit different on the
two days, but I think the one Saturday may be more interesting if you can
only attend one.  Will probably show the blooper reel (two, actually, one
on each day), and a previously unseen episode will be debuted.
 
     One advisory: at just about every con I've attended and done this
kind of presentation, the B5 items tends to wind up as either the most
heavily attended event, or close to it.  So if anyone's going, you may want
to show up a bit early to make sure you get a decent seat.  Also, I tend
to show up a bit early myself, to make sure the video equipment and stuff
is working correctly, and hang out; sometimes I say stuff I can't say in
front of a larger group.  (Those who were at the Chicago ComicCon on the
first day can verify this one.)
