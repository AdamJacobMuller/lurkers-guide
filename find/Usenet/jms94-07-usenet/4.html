<H2>Londo based on Brother Theodor</H2>
4 Jul 1994<PRE>     Actually, no, Londo was not based on Brother Theodore, who I only
discovered some time later on Letterman.  But Harlan and Peter David
mentioned at the panel that Brother Theodore could make a swell brother
for Londo in some episode, so this is something I may consider....
