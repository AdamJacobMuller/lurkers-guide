<H2>Interesting lines in "Voice"</H2>
30 Jul 1994<PRE>     It seems to me that every generation thinks that things are
changing, usually for the worse.  In some cases, they may be right.  The
B5 story is set at a point in time where things are very much in a state
of flux.  Every so often, the wheel turns.  Everybody's feeling a sense
of growing uncertainty, of the chairs being moved around.  They're right.
