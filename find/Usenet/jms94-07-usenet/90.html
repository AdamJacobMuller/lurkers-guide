<H2>Mars &amp; Psi Corps</H2>
27 Jul 1994<PRE>     Actually, the Psi Corp rep did mention that the Free Mars movement
has been growing over the years, but that no one knew that they were quite
this well organized, or well-armed, the sign of a good resistance; not
that they "didn't know anything about the revolt."  Just a clarification.
