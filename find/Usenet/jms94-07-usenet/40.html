<H2>Who founded the Babylon Projec</H2>
12 Jul 1994<PRE>    David...what an absolutely wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful
question.
 
    I think I'll answer this in an episode next season.
 
    It's something that I've known, and just filed away, but yeah, this
should be dealt with.  And I'll do so.  (Though now you have to wait to
see it on TeeVee.)
