<H2>Re: JMS' Real Ghostbusters</H2>
17 Jul 1994<PRE>     Yeah, I knew Lorenzo Music while we were doing the show, but not
afterward; we never really hung out or anything.  He's a roundish,
friendly kind of guy.  We always had to separate him from Frank Welker
and Maurice LeMarche in the sound studio, because if they were *ever* in
close proximity, all kinds of hell would break out.  One day they got into
a competition to do celebrity farts...little Doris Day squibs, a George
C. Scott roller...we managed to keep it together until Frank let fly with
his version of a William Conrad thunderer...which went on and on and on...
windows blew out...buttons flew off shirts...and when it finally came to
its conclusion, *no one* was able to do *anything* for about twenty
minutes.  Shut *everything* down.  No one could keep a straight face or
get a line out.  And Frank just sat there, smiling innocently.
