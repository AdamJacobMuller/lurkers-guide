<H2>JMS:  Voting Procedure of Coun</H2>
9 Jul 1994<PRE>     We didn't have the League of Non-Aligned Worlds up and running for
the pilot.  They get one vote, determined by majority decision.  EAch
mamber of the main Advisory Council gets one vote, equal to that.
 
     In "Deathwalker," you had one abstention (Kosh), two to try her
(EA and League), and three against the trial (Narns, Centauri and
Minbari).  Abstentions don't count either way in such a vote; it's the
negatives vs. the positives, and there were more no's than yes's.
