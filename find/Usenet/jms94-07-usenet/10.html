<H2>JMS - yet another small questi</H2>
5 Jul 1994<PRE>     The bays are called Cobra Bays because that's kind of the shape of
the bays from the outside as they wrap around the front, round part of the
station (narrow at one end, flaring out big at the other).  The name
refers to the look of the place, not what's stored inside.
 
     Will definitely keep on...well, spacin'....
