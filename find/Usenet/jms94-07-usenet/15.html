<H2>What makes B5 different and sp</H2>
6 Jul 1994<PRE>     Actually, one follow-up...one thing we've been very careful about is
that when something is referenced in episode 9 that took place in episode
3, you don't *have* to have seen episode 3 for it to make sense; the
information you need is collapsed or somehow incorporated into the dialogue
in episode 9.  Meaning that while VCRs and repeated viewings and groups
can help to *predict* stuff, you don't need to have seen ANY prior episodes
of the show to enjoy any one episode of the show.
 
     But the *more* you watch, the more you get out of it.
