<H2>Reflections on "Voice" (part 1</H2>
29 Jul 1994<PRE>     Actually, this was not the first B5 or Sinclair had heard about the
escalating problem on Mars; remember, that was the main reason that Ben
Zayn had been sent to B5 in "Eyes," smoking out sympathisers with the
Free Mars movement.
 
     Also, the fissure wasn't created by the quakes; Tasaki mentions it
was artificial, but nudged open by the tremors.
