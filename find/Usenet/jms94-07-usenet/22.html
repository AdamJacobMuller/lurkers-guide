<H2>Re: What makes B5 different an</H2>
8 Jul 1994<PRE>     Correct; the title of "The War Prayer" is a nod to Twain's piece of
the same name, which should be ready by *everyone*.  Given the growing
problems with illiteracy, I try to refer not to pop society so much, as
to literature...Tennyson, Twain, even writers whose last names don't
begin with T.
