<H2>Re: Drumhead parallels</H2>
16 Jul 1994<PRE>     Brett has already uploaded some of my comments from elsewhere on this
topic.  Let me only emphasize some stuff here.  As stated, Larry never
SAW the Drumhead.  We generally make it a point NOT to watch what's done
on ST to avoid being influenced.  Second, the basic ending which you feel
is strictly ST's can be seen in the Caine Mutiny, A Few Good Men and
others.  "Eyes" was a direct consequence of all that preceded it in our
first season.  It came about because Larry suggested that with all that
Sinclair has done, sooner or later somebody's going to take notice back
on Earth.  There would have to be some kind of investigation.  Because
we are doing some very specific things with the Psi Corps this year and
next, which I wanted to foreshadow, a PC telepath was inserted into the
story, to show that they are starting to get a foothold into the military,
with new laws concerning scans.
 
     We knocked the story back and forth for some time, and it went through
many different permutations.  We also figured that the episode should be
kind of a Cliff's Notes guide to season one, hitting the high points for
those who joined the series later than those who were here at the
beginning.  The ending also went through various changes, but what made the
most logical sense was to get the Colonel to admit bias in some fashion or
another...and the only way to do this really was to get him so angry, so
furious, that he'd incriminate himself enough, or open the door enough for
Mr. Grey to verify the bias.
 
     That was how the structure was arrived at.  I was there.  It had
nothing -- *nothing* -- whatsoever to do with the Drumhead, which I have
a vague memory was written by Jeri Taylor, who is a friend of mine, and
further invalidates the very idea.
 
                                                                  jms
