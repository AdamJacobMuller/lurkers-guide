<H2>jms: TRG songs?</H2>
8 Jul 1994<PRE>     Yeah, I wrote all the lyrics for the songs in "The Halloween Door,"
including Egon's piece, and the lyrical (without music) goodbye to Poe,
Bradbury and the rest.  I've written a few songs here and there, a couple
of which have actually been recorded, but I won't tell you where.
