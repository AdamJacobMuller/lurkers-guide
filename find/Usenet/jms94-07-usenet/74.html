<H2>General question on writing fo</H2>
18 Jul 1994<PRE>     I have never seen *any* scriptwriting seminar that was worth $400 for
a couple days.  You would be best advised to take that money and buy $400
worth of scripts, the best-written scripts you can find.  Read every one of
them three times.  By the time you have done that, you will have learned
far more than you could have *ever* learned in any seminar.
 
     And I have my own problems with McKee's school of thought as well,
but that's another story.
