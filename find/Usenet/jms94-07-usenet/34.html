<H2>B5 Ratings</H2>
11 Jul 1994<PRE>     Just a couple points on the ratings cited...the reruns which were
being broadcast at that time (and reruns get lower numbers anyway) were
being killed by the NBA playoffs and finals, which were going on in the
same timeslot.  (Actually, throughout June, everybody was getting hit to
some degree; we got it worse because we were at 8 in many markets opposite
the NBA, but it ain't that much of a difference.)
 
     From the overnights on "Grail," we're pretty much back where we
were prior to reruns, a definite jump upward...an increase of about two
ratings points.
 
     Cost-wise, btw, we're about the same price as "Kung Fu," so there
isn't much difference in that respect.
