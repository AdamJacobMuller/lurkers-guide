<H2>Re: DiTillo at Westercon 4/2</H2>
9 Jul 1994<PRE>     Once again, some of this is getting distorted.  We are looking for
the best person to play this new role.  Once we decide who it is we want,
we will run this past PTEN for their approval.  It is nothing more or
less than this.  Bostwick, who I personally very much wanted to work with,
was NOT -- repeat, *not* -- turned down by PTEN.  We courted him for a
bit, but in the final analysis he decided that he didn't want to do a
syndicated series.  We have only this week, for the first time, formally
presented the name of a prospective actor to PTEN.
 
     As stated, Larry was in considerable discomfort due to a kidney
stone, and has been more or less out of the loop, due to working on his
first script and not formally beginning his term yet as story editor for
this season.  As one example of this...the line that Sinclair will not be
seen until *after* the second season is also incorrect.  We have already
shot a sequence with Sinclair, which is slated for the second season.
 
 
     Larry is very bothered about how this is being distorted, and he told me
to remind certain people that he specifically said that if any of this
turned up on the nets, he would find the person responsible, go to their
home and kill them.  Granted, he was on painkillers at the time, but *I*
certainly wouldn't push it.
