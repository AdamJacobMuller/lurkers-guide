<H2>Points of Departure.</H2>
26 Jul 1994<PRE>     The idea of a Chrysalis II went by the boards once I really got into
the script, and realized that C1 had tipped over too many tables to even
HOPE to resolve them in one follow-up episode.  So the threads yanked
in C1 will be paid off over several episodes, hence no C2; the first
episode of year two is "Points of Departure."
