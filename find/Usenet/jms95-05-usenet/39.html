<H2>ATTN JMS: References</H2>
19 May 1995<PRE>     Securecam is NOT a reference to Max Headroom.  It is a work formed
out of Security and Camera, which is the function of the ones mounted on
the station, as Maintcam goes on the maintainance bots.  The Psi Corps
line in the commercial is not a reference to Paranoia.
 
     Not everything in this show is a reference to some other show.  We
do have some interest in doing our *own* story, rather than nodding to
every series on the face of the planet, and not all concepts started in
the other shows that used them.
