<H2>Garabaldi's Eyes??!</H2>
11 May 1995<PRE>     (sigh)  Our rotoscope EFX guy was waiting for a bunch of PPG EFX to
finish rendering in that battle scene, and was bored, and like many such
EFX types, filled in the eyes of Garibaldi with weird stuff while waiting
around.  When the other scene finished rendering, he got out, believing
that he had not saved that one frame.  Unknowingly, he had.
 
     Nobody caught it until after broadcast.
 
     We talked.
