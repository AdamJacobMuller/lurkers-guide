<H2>From jms re: Internet Gateway</H2>
17 May 1995<PRE>     To those who've inquired: my regular GEnie internet gateway is down
and has been for the last several days.  This happens periodically, for
whatever bizarre reason.  I can still get private email, but not the
usenet.  It generally comes back up again in a bit.
