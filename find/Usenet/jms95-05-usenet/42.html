<H2>This is going too far</H2>
19 May 1995<PRE>     Then again, you are assuming that you are being told the truth about
the bothersome phone call.  I'm not saying it *ain't* true, or that it is,
only that I've seen this gag pulled before, where somebody comes in, posts
a message that gets an argument going, gets ganged up on, and then says
he or she is being "threatened" or intimidated in some way, in order to
play the victim (and also win an unwinnable argument) and get people on
his/her side.
 
     In all the years I've been on the nets, I haven't encountered one real
case of this, and given the nature of discussion on this forum, there have
been *real major* flamewars which cause this one to pale into
insignificance, and if THOSE didn't provoke such calls, I don't see why
this one would, all of a sudden.
 
                                                                   jms
