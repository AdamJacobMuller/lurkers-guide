26 May 1995<PRE>     It's very sad, Bruce, that you think the only way to get a response
is to insult people and use emotionally-laden "hot-buttons" to try and
inflame them.
 
     I've generally found that a reasoned, simple, polite question gets
answered far more often.  Perhaps next time you should try it.
