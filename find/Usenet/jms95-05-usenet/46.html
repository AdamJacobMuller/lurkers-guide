<H2>Notes from jms</H2>
19 May 1995<PRE>     Some quickies....
 
     1) Claudia Christian, Bill Mumy and I will be appearing (on various
days/times) at the Creation MegaShow to be held at the Anaheim Convention
Center, in California, May 27-28.  I don't know when they'll be up, but
I'm slated for Sunday.  (Plus Mark Hammil, Stan Lee and some Voyager
folks.)
 
     2) Parents with small kids who watch B5 may want to consider
screening the next episode, "Confessions and Lamentations," first, in
order to determine how to talk to your kids about it.  It's a *very*
intense episode and uncompromising.
 
     3) Yes, as discussed elsewhere here, Warners has scheduled the last
four episodes of this season to run in October, to build momentum toward
what (we hope) will be the season three debut, though no official word
has yet been given on year three.
