<H2>Re: "Rip-Offs" and Con Organiz</H2>
25 May 1995<PRE>     1) Tom C. informed me that arrangements had been made with Capricon
for the bunch of us to appear there on Saturday, though explaining that it
"couldn't be put into the program because we didn't have an exact time."
Which seemed kinda funny to me at the time.
 
     2) Upon arriving, at Tom's insistence (I at no time even knew about
the convention until Tom told us we were booked to stop by as a "goodwill
investment"), it did seem that *nobody* knew we were coming, which upset
me more than a little.
 
     3) I did insist on a room rather than being stuck in the dealer's
room, at a table selling unauthorized merchandise.
 
     4) As we left the convention, I had a very angry conversation with
Tom, in that insufficient groundwork had been done, no preparations or
arrangements had been made, and the entire thing was sloppily done, and
that it couldn't be allowed to be done this way again.
 
     So Bruce, if you're going to start talking about "the net of a
thousand lies," I strongly suggest you get your OWN facts straight first,
because all of points 1-4 preceding can be verified by all the cast
members who were in that car.  You, I note, were not present.
 
                                                                jms
