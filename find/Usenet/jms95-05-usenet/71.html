<H2>Big Bang Warning from jms</H2>
26 May 1995<PRE>     I just received a message from someone I know that there is an ad for
the Big Bang Convention in the current issue of STAR WARS INSIDER that
just came out listing me as attending.  I am in the process of getting my
hands on the actual ad to verify this, but since the source is a reliable
one, I wanted to alert anyone who might see this that I am most definitely
NOT attending, CMC/Tom Christofferson has known this for months now, and
the advertisement is absolutely false in that regard.  He has been
forbidden to use any references or representations regarding me or Warner
Bros., and if this information turns out correct, and I have no reason to
doubt that at the moment, this will be turned over to lawyers.
 
     Meanwhile, to repeat: I will NOT be attending this convention, nor
is this convention in any way endorsed by Babylonian Productions or PTEN
or Warner Bros.
