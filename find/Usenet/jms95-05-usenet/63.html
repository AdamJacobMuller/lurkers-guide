25 May 1995<PRE>     Re: Tom C.'s statement that he "had to call in a lot of favors" to get
us into CapriCon is one of the -- no, make that THE -- most ludicrous
thing I have ever heard.  More of his trying to inflate his position.  I
suspect that if Michael O'Hare or I or anyone else showed up at a con, we
probably wouldn't have a hard time getting in, given the number of requests
that come in for their presence.
 
     More CMC bullshit.  Pure and simple, and as with all the CMC bullshit,
painfully obvious for what it is.  Which is one of many reasons I withdrew
any endorsement from B5 for their "event."  I wouldn't work with these
people if I were dying of cancer and they were paying in chemotherapy.
