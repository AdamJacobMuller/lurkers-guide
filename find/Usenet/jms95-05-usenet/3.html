<H2>ATTN: JMS: Has the Arc Changed</H2>
10 May 1995<PRE>     Actually, no, believe or not the arc really hasn't changed much; it's
gotten filled out a bit in places, but the direction hasn't altered.  I
had always had kind of a (?) in the thing as to how to transition clearly
from Sinclair to the Shadows, because I needed some way to connect the
stories, but having Sinclair have a hook to the shadows just strained
credulity past the breaking point.  Gradually I figured out a way to do
that, and that (?) was filled.  Other than that, no; it's going where it
was always going.
