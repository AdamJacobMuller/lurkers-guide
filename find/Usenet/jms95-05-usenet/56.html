<H2>Some technical questions</H2>
24 May 1995<PRE>     The majority of those questions are best left to Ron to one day
explain in a tech manual, as he has more of the hard-science info at his
fingertips than I do.  Certainly, both tachyon and ansibles are part of
an instantaneous communications system.  And yes, there was some amount
of conscription during the wars.
