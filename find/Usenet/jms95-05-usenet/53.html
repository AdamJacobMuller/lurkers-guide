<H2>Screw the plague! (possible sp</H2>
24 May 1995<PRE>     Next time I will try and locate every other producer in town and
see what they plan to produce, so I can plan accordingly.  When I wrote
the episode, Outbreak hadn't been promoted yet or known about, Voyager
hadn't aired, ER hadn't told me what they were going to do...if I'd
known there would be such a glut...well, I probably would've done so
anyway, because this isn't so much about the plague and saying its'
dangerous, but about our attitudes when we are confronted by this, which
really hasn't been dealt with that much in SF.  (And I'm sorry, but
don't even *try* to bring the Voyager story into this; the ship is
threatened by a cheese contamination?  I almost fell off my chair.)
