<H2>For JMS:  Cons and Con Jobs</H2>
25 May 1995<PRE>     Dan'l...you make a lot of good points. The only one I'd argue with
is the "Worldcon is an exhibition, and all attendees at businsss
exhibitions pay to get in."  (Paraphrase)  Not true.  Invariably, any
good exhibition of business convention allows for industry passes; I was
at E3, the big multimedia exhibition/convention in LA a week or so ago,
with 30-40,000 attendees, and media pros/industry types were comp'd,
because it's the presence of these individuals that brings in others.  If
Worldcon is, as you say, more a business than a convention (which is
on one level kinda less than it was intended, he said wistfully), then
it should begin acting like one.
