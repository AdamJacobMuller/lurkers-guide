<H2>Why Is Babylon 5 So Bad?</H2>
10 May 1995<PRE>     Dear S.S. (an appropriate acronym, assuming this is indeed your real
name) ...there is a quote about books which applies just about as well to
televsion.  I pass it on to you as the sole reasonable reply to your
missive.
 
     "A book is like a mirror.  If an ass peers in, you can't exactly
expect an apostle to peer out."
 
                                                                 jms
