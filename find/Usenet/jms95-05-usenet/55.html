<H2>which comes first...</H2>
24 May 1995<PRE>     Actually, the chronological order was *supposed* to be "Knives," THEN
"Z'ha'dum."  In "Knives" you get the reminder about Anna, then in
"Z'ha'dum" you get the payoff.  That was originally how they were intended
to be aired, but there was *so much* CGI work and rotoscope work and
creature animation involved in "Knives" that it got flopped to second in
that order.  So while it works *best* the way it was intended, it still
works okay in this order.
