11 May 1995<PRE>     When Delenn underwent the chrysalis, it modified the epidermal layer
at the back of the head, making it somewhat smaller, more human; this left
a gap between the bone (which grows out from the temples and joins at the
back, like antlers in reverse), and the hair comes through this gap.
