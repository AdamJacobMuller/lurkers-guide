<H2>Pros at Cons</H2>
28 May 1995<PRE>     Actually, I don't tend to use the hospitality suite much at cons;
I generally hang out in the halls or in the dealer's room or in going to
panels, rather than hiding out.  I also don't tend to eat much before a
presentation as it kafuffles my synapses and all I can do is stand there
and belch (which, granted, is some small improvement over my usual
performance).
