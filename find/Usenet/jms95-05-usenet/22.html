<H2>ATTN: JMS  - Anna *Sheridan*?</H2>
18 May 1995<PRE>     Anna chose to take Sheridan's last name.  Her decision.  You have the
option.  Some do, some don't.  If you start to pass rules that no woman
CAN take her husband's name or she's betraying something, then you're being
just as restrictive as those who insist a woman MUST take her husband's
name.  Me, I'm pro-choice on every level.  She felt like it.
 
     (And I note that my own spousal overunit kept her own name.  But then,
who in her right mind WOULD take Straczynski...?)
