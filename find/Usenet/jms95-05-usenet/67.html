<H2>C&amp;L Analysis *SPOILERS*</H2>
25 May 1995<PRE>     What you also have to do is step back for a moment and remember that
the dinner began prior to Keffer and the rest leaving B5; and was ending
about the time they got back.  Add up the time indicated, and you've got
a ritual that has gone on for at LEAST 3-4 hours now, probably closer to
5-6; seated in a small room, legs crossed, after what was almost certainly
a busy day.  Show me somebody who WOULDN'T doze off after a while.
