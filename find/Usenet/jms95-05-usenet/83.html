<H2>PC Babylon</H2>
27 May 1995<PRE>     PC's got nothing to do with it.  But 1) the syph epidemic didn't
occur to me, and 2) this was nowhere NEAR the level of plague that we were
addressing.  It didn't occur to me while writing it, and if it had, I
probably would've excluded it because it wasn't relevant.  I would also
add that *all* sides in this particular storyline acted with varying
degrees of irrationality, so if there was one side or the other held up
as wiser or better, I sure didn't see it.  Or write it.
 
     There are legitimate complaints one can bring of political
correctness.  Unfortunately, it has gained such wide currency, and is
used so broadly in non-applicable areas, that the term has lost most of
its meaning and effectiveness.  Nowadays PC is meant to mean anything one
disagrees with, anything with a possible moral or idea, to denigrate
anything and everything but absolute rudeness.  It's a dismissive, nothing
more.
