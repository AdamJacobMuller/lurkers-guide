<H2>ATTN:JMS--Thanks for Vir</H2>
18 May 1995<PRE>     Thanks.  I like Vir a lot.  Many folks were willing to write him off
in the beginning, not understanding that there was more beneath the
surface (a problem Vir has also had in his "life").  But you gotta be
careful; characters have a way of surprising you.  And I like that, and
intended that, Vir be the first one to stand up to Morden.
