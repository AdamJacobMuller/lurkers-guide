<H2>Someone's Impersonating jms</H2>
28 May 1995<PRE>     I recently received information that someone is impersonating me in
Internet Relay Chat.  This person has been going under the handle of
straczynski@nwlink.com.  I have just sent this creep a message privately
outlining the whole *host* of civil, criminal and related laws under which
I will prosecute him if he continues in this action.  Be advised that this
person is out there, and if you see this address, or anything similar,
be advised this person is committing fraud.  Anyone who wants to further
assist with tracking down this person is welcome, though we already have
quite a bit.  Email replies only.
 
                                                                jms
