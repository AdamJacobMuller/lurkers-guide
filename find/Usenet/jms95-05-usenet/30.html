<H2>Congratulations to JMS! (Was R</H2>
18 May 1995<PRE>     Let me clarify this.  We have not -- NOT -- been officially renewed,
nor is PTEN looking for money.  Every year, the two parts of PTEN (the
stations, and Warner Bros.) engage in negotiations over that year, in
terms of deal points, commercial times available to sell, number of runs
per week and other areas.  They have indicated to us that they would like
the PTEN shows to continue, but that is all contingent upon both sides
working out their differences on deal stuff.  That is where we stand at
this moment.  It's taking a while for them to nail all this stuff down.
