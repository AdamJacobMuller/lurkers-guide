19 May 1995<PRE>     There are NO "production time restraints" involved in delaying the
last 4 episodes until October, which can be easily verified by the fact
that we'll be delivering all the finished episodes in time for the UK to
air these same last 4 episodes in June/July.  They'll just sit on a shelf
here in the US until October.
