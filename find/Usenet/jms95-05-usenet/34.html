<H2>JMS: Now you did it!!!</H2>
18 May 1995<PRE>     The balance of season two eps will show up in reruns between the end
of May and the next batch/last batch of year two eps...which I've learned
will be held until *OCTOBER* to (in theory) help folks get a running start
on year three (still awaiting final word).  Also, WB is concerned about
running year one reruns because it might confuse people to see a different
CO running the place.
 
     (I just report the news, I don't make it.)
