<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Thanks for the recommendation</H2>
2 Jun 1998<PRE>&gt;When did swing come back?  I must have been asleep or something...but
&gt;it's wonderful music and never fails to make me feel better if I'm down.

I dunno...seems like the kids today call it "swank."  I first came across it
with the Squirrel Nut Zippers, then Cherry Poppin' Daddies, now Big Bad Voodoo
Daddy...there are any number of swing clubs opening up these days (we had the
B5 wrap party at one of them here in LA)...I don't know what made it hit
critical mass, but I'm glad it did.

What I like about some of these, like Cherry Poppin' Daddies, is that they
apply the music of swing to some pretty raw-edged lyrics, which makes for a
combination that is at once modern but familiar, edgy but reassuring.
