<H2>Re: ATTN:  JMS</H2>
17 Jun 1998<PRE>&gt;My question to you is this:  If you (or anybody) had to do it all over again,
&gt;is there a way you could set up a contract so you would get what is rightly
&gt;yours?

If I'd walked into the room with three or four hit series under my belt, I
would've walked out with a considerably different deal.  As the deal currently
stands...well, as you say, hell will be covered with frost before I see any
profits, given the way such things are defined in a first-time series.  The
definition on Crusade is a little better, but only a little.  

On the other hand...I find it very hard to get too upset about it, because the
bottom line is I'm being paid to tell the kind of stories I'd have to tell
anyway, for free.  Where else can you get a deal like that?
