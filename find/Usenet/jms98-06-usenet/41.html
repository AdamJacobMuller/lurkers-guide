<H2>Re: DS9 episode</H2>
17 Jun 1998<PRE>Excuse me, but all I said was that I was amazed that the story, as described to
me, got on.  I did not specifically condemn anything in the episode, and
generally don't coment on DS9 stuff.  Someone mentioned it to me online and
specifically asked for my reaction.  I was as brief as I could possibly be, one
line, no more, no less.
