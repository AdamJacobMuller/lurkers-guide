&gt;A thoroughly impertinent question: do you ever cry when you write?
&gt;
&gt;	I'm curious because I occasionally start to cry when I am writing
&gt;poetry or fiction, though if I am deeply involved in the work I may not
&gt;even notice until later.  
&gt; I remember your saying once, I think on
&gt;this newsgroup, that if you do not move yourself, you will not move the
&gt;audience.     

On occasion, yeah...I think you have to really feel that if you want to do it
to someone else.  When I bumped off Kosh, there was a little of that...and
there were some scenes in "Confessions and Lamentations" that did that, and
definitely in "Sleeping in Light."

Thing is, last night I pulled out the tapes for the last two episodes, "Objects
at Rest" and "Sleeping in Light," and watched them back to back, and I was an
absolute wreck afterward.  There are a couple of scenes in both of them that
just put me away.  That's *good*, they should, they have to, but man...I was
just gone.  

But strangest of all, the final credits sequence and what we did with them for
SiL is also very deeply affecting...and I'm not entirely sure why, I think it's
something operating at an almost subconscious level, about seeing certain
images juxtaposed.  Darndest thing....
