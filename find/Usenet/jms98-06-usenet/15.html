&gt;It would be perfectly reasonable given his known personality for Sheridan
&gt;to have not assigned Lennier to the Centauri border for any number of
&gt;reasons, and not necessarily to "protect Delenn."  And if that *wasn't*
&gt;one of his reasons, he'd have her butt hand delivered with a singing
&gt;telegram to go with it.  But instead, her reasoning just happens to be
&gt;right.

&gt;Mind you, I love Delenn's character, but she should be right by reason
&gt;and not right by dramatic license.

She's right because she's married to the guy and knows him inside and out,
including how he thinks and why he does things.

When you live with somebody like that, you can go out and buy a pair of shoes,
and in the morning, complain that they're too tight...and never mention it
again for the rest of the day...then in the evening you sigh, as you're taking
them off, and he or she says, "Don't worry, we can always have them stretched."
