6 Jun 1998<PRE>I think it would be next to impossible to prevent prostitution in an
environment such as this.  And in some cultures, it would not be a big thing at
all, not illegal, and cultural behavior between members of the same species
that is allowable within that society is generally allowed on B5 as well,
provided that it does not affect anyone outside that species.
