<H2>Re: Attn: JMS A Professor's Letter to JMS (forwarded)</H2>
2 Jun 1998<PRE>&gt;At some point, I envision teaching a class in rhetorical
&gt;philosophy using B5 as the point of analysis.  I hope that is
&gt;something that would be acceptable to you as a use of your
&gt;universe--what a marvelous way to open up Plato, Aristotle, Cicero,
&gt;and Quintilian to new generations. 

What, no Marcus Aurelius?  For shame.  We'll have to knock ten points off your
grade for that one.

Seriously, though...to the degree that the show can encourage discussion, and
dialogue, and the free exchange of ideas that point to the history of
literature and philosophy, I am a happy man.  By all means, if it's useful, use
it.  (As I understand it, this spring there is a class nominally in the
Philosophy of Babylon 5 at the University of Illinois at Urbana.)

And thank you...not just for the kind words, but for the open mind that
preceded them.
