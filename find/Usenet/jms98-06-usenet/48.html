<H2>Re: AtTn JmS:  The Harlan Award</H2>
21 Jun 1998<PRE>&gt;Tell us, for the sake of
&gt;future TV producers who may work with Harlan and the people who love them,
&gt;how did you do it?

Simple.  Just respect what he brings to the table, and don't fuck with him.  In
over a decade of calling Harlan a friend, I have never seen him go after
anybody who didn't go after him first.

&gt;What I want to know is how much  of the quarter-million-book-library
&gt;mentioned in the same show Harlan has actually read.  Come to think of it,
&gt;I also want to know Harlan's reading speed, JMS's reading speed, and if
&gt;either of them can recommend an effective, reliable and reasonably priced
&gt;speed-reading course!

I figure if somebody took time to get it right, you don't speed read past it.
