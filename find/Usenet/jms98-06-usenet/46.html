&gt;It would be a big kindness to hear why TNT is not promoting Thirdspace
&gt;with the same vigor they did for B5 thus far. They haven't really
&gt;answered
&gt;the question

Usually you don't promote a show until a couple of weeks before it airs.  The
promotion for ItB was also the promotion to launch the entire SERIES, which
needed bigger lead time.  In TV, you rarely promote a standalone like
Thirdspace more than a couple of weeks before airing.
