14 Jun 1998<PRE>&gt;I am really enjoying the Cherry Poppin' Daddies and Big Bad Voodoo Daddy
&gt;CDs you mentioned. Thanks for the heads up. 

Not a prob.

&gt;In both I notice a major fascination with alcohol consumption, abuse and
&gt;its consequences the likes of which I haven't run into since the Gin
&gt;Blossoms debut. 
&gt;It lead me to wonder, in light of poor Mr. Garibaldi's current treatment
&gt;in your hands, exactly when did you start listening to this stuff?

Unnecessary; there's a long history of that stuff in my family. 

Which is why I stay far, far away from alcohol, drugs or ciggies; when you have
addictive personalities in your family going back generations, it's generally a
bad idea.
