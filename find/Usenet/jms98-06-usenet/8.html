<H2>Re: Darkness Ascending= Damn Amazing!  &lt;Spoilers&gt;</H2>
6 Jun 1998<PRE>&gt;Nice to see certain characters back in their old forms.
&gt;Delenn is not a lady to mess around with- even in an arguement.  She
&gt;didn't merely hand Johnny's butt back to him, she GIFTWRAPPED the
&gt;fragger, and put a pretty bow on it!  Nice verbal Judo, there. 

That's one of my favorite scenes from that episode...she basically yanks his
pants up over his head and ties them in a knot.  Someone trained in the
religious caste can argue her way around just about anything and anyone.

Minbari religious caste make Jesuits look like intellectual softies by
comparison.
