<H2>Re: And All My Dreams, Torn Asunder ( *Spoilers* )</H2>
17 Jun 1998<PRE>No, what you're noting is just about right.

I wanted this job to be something Sheridan grows into.  He's going to make
mistakes; he's not trained for this kind of job, and errors are part of the
learning process.  In Deconstruction it's noted that he said himself that the
teep situation was the worst mistake of his entire career.  There were others.

The first year of any new government is rocky at best; mistakes get made,
sometimes huge ones.  What he will have to do is learn from them.  Even by the
last few episodes, he has his act more together; moreso as the years pass.  In
some ways, and this was something I was going for in "Asunder," he's been
pulling back, trying to figure out what to do and in some ways, cutting against
his best instincts to keep things together.  It's really after he blows at the
end of "Asunder" that he begins to do what he should've done all along: go with
his instincts, rather than second-guessing himself.
