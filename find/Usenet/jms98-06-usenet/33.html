<H2>Re: And All My Dreams, Torn Asunder ( *Spoilers* )</H2>
16 Jun 1998<PRE>If some people are upset at the Centauri moon, that's a damned silly thing to
be upset about.  Most moons are too small to have any real atmosphere, so
there's nothing to keep meteors from hitting and causing craters rather than
burning up on entry.  So you're going to have pockmarks.  We made it a point to
have the patterns different than our own moon.  It's round because most
planetary bodies *are*.  And the local sun has the same basic spectral
qualities as Sol, so you're going to get similar bounce-back on the light.

An equal amount of effort goes into making that moon or a more odd one.  But
not everything has to be constantly different just to be different.
