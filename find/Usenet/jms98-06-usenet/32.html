&gt;Did the Centauri warships attack Centauri civilian ships as well as the ships
&gt;of other races?  Or were Centauri ships left alone (and was the Alliance
&gt;incredibly thick in not working out who was behind the raids?)

It was stated in the episode that at least one Centauri low priority ship was
attacked.
