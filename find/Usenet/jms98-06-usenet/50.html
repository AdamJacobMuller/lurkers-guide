<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Londo's "old" makeup</H2>
24 Jun 1998<PRE>&gt;It just struck me how *convincing* Londo looked 20 years into the future as
&gt;an
&gt;old man.  The makeup is startlingly believable, much more so than most other
&gt;"old" makeup I have ever seen

&gt;So what's the secret?  How were you and your crew able to pull off something
&gt;that no one else, with any size budget, was able to successfully accomplish?

I think it comes from the makeup folk knowing every line in Peter's face from
five years of working with him, and how to bring it out, something you don't
often get in films.
