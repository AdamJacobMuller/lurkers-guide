25 Feb 1997<PRE>Hey Tom!

Even though the Joe uses "another" platform, the show actually uses
many!  Macs have been essential to the creation of the show from the
beginning.  Even farther back, the Amiga and the Newtek Toaster were
employed.  

Currently we use Pentiums and Alphas for animation, Macs for Editing,
Matte paintings and Compositing, and SGI's for Compositing and titling. 
If that isn't platform independent, I don't know what is!

So, Andy can continue to like the show, AND be true to the magazine he
works for!
