<H2>Re: ATT: JMS No Models from Revell?</H2>
16 Feb 1997<PRE>"recently I read that you saw ads for the model ships to be made by
Revell/Modello, and thought they'd be out soon.  I rushed out to the local
hobby shop, where the owner had heard nothing new on the subject."

These were ads that were coming through my hands for approval.  They won't
be appearing for a while yet...but definitely later this year.  They
wouldn't be sending me ad copy if they weren't planning to do something. 
Since the ads just came through, they wouldn't have shown up in the latest
catalog.
