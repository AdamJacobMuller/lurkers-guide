27 Feb 1997<PRE>Steve-

It is most assuredly NOT the way the sound is done on the show.  We do
take advantage ofthe extra dynamic range offered by digital post
production, and that sometimes results in a 2 or 3 db difference between
us and the commercials, but not the phenomenon you describe.  I would
love to speak with your affiliate to see if there is some help we can
offer.
