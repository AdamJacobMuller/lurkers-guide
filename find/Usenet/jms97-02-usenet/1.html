:I am unaware of any *deliberate* attempt to have people tortured to
authenticate information. The deception consisted of several elements."

That you may not be aware of it does not mean it's incorrect.

I ran across this information in an article in The Los Angeles Times about
8 years ago.  It was something of a big deal because the situation had
been kept secret ever since the war, and when it came out it caused a
great deal of distress (and discussion) about the ethics involved.

I called a couple of other people who I talked to when the article first
came out, and their recollection of it is the same as mine.

I'll try and get around to doing a search on the LA Times database, to see
if I can find the exact references, though I don't know if their search
engine goes back that far.
