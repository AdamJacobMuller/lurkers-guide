"As you seem to be very quiet about the possible futures, here is my
question:
	What do you *want*? :-)"

To tell stories.

It's all I've ever wanted.

As for the future of B5, whatever happens...I proved that it could be
done, when the Industry said it couldn't.  What I set out to achieve, I've
achieved...now it's just surviving the last stages of it all.
