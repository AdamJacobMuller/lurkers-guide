<H2>Re: ATTN GEORGE:  Equipment question</H2>
24 Feb 1997<PRE>Hey, Lee-

Whoa- sounds more like a lightwave mailing list question! :-)

The arsenal looks like the following- 

Alphas for design stations serving 5 animators and one animation
assistant (housekeeping and slate specialist).  Most of these stations
run Lightwave and a couple add Softimage.  VERY plug-in hungry.  PVR's
on every station, with calibrated component NTSC (darn it, I hates ntsc)
right beside.

P6's in quad enclosures for part of the renderstack, and Alphas for the
rest, backed up 2x per day to an optical jukebox.

Completed shots output to a DDR post rendering and get integrated into
the show.

Shots to composite go to the Macs running After Effects, or the SGI
running Flint, depending on the type of comp being done, and then to the
DDR (8 minutes capacity on the SGI).

Boy it sure sounds easy!  The only problem is, we have a killer schedule
and very picky producers, and ESPECIALLY picky viewers! :-)

It is, however, a bunch of fun!

George Johnsen
CoProducer, B5
