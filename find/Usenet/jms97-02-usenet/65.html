<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Question on Ethics in Writing</H2>
25 Feb 1997<PRE>The line about meaning what you say is an old saying that goes 'way, way
back, long before the O'Toole movie.  And as far as Caligula goes, the
sense of it is there, but not the details...and even if they *were*,
basing part of a story on historical precedent, on actual events, is
hardly inappropriate.  (And in this case, again, it isn't based on
that...evocative of it, yes, but nothing more.)

The notion of the Vorlons and Shadows representing Order and Chaos goes
back to the Babylonian creation myths, that the universe was born in the
conflict between order and chaos, hence part of the reason I decided to
name this show after Babylon.  That's called *research*.  It informs the
show, but it is not the show.
