14 Feb 1997<PRE>Thanks...the show can be a nudge, but only a nudge...you have to do what
needs to be done, and you did exactly this.  All praise and responsibility
rests at your feet; I got nothing to do with it, but I will, with thanks
and appreciation, reflect for a moment the sunshine of your accomplishment
as though I actually had something to do with dawn.  Good luck.
