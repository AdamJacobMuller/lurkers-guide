<H2>jms thinkpad story: end notes</H2>
9 Feb 1997<PRE>Just a follow-up since a few have asked....

A while back, I posted about the IBM Thinkpad 560 that I bought, which
went kablooey within 24 hours and could not be fixed, and the multiple
incompetent attempts to make it work by techs who had never touched this
model before.  I vented here in my frustration about it all.

Well, what then happened was that a Very Nice Man named Robert Kirk at IBM
heard about this, and intervened.  Through his own resources, he had it
checked out thoroughly, and discovered that the motherboard was wired
wrong, and badly, with some connections not fully made, so it'd work one
minute, and not the next.

It's subsequently been replaced, and it has been running fine ever since. 
I've held back saying anything more until I was sure...but it's a fine
little machine, now that it's working.

Sometimes, as with any bureaucracy, you have to get their attention, and
that's what the nets are good for.  I heard from several others who had to
go through similar steps..and if you plink them in public, they will
sometimes do what they will never do for you in private.
