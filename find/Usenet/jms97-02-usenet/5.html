3 Feb 1997<PRE>"He (Mr. Ellison that is) also mentioned that J. Michael Straczynski took
over hosting a radio show in the LA area. I haven't ever heard of this
before (as opposed to knowing about Cap'n Power- one of my favs as a kid,
Ghostbusters, etc.), and I was wondering if it was really you."

Yeah, that was me.  The show was HOUR 25, a 2-hour weekly talk show
covering SF, fantasy, comics, horror, you name it.  I hosted the show for
5 years on KPFK-FM.
