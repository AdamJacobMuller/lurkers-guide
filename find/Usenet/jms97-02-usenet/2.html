<H2>Re: jms graphics note (cgal repost)</H2>
2 Feb 1997<PRE>Mojo:

I will point out to you that in my original message, I never even
MENTIONED Foundation, or referred to it in any way, manner, shape or form.

You did that on your own.  You made baseless statements about our entire
EFX team coming from Foundation, when you know this is an absolute and
utter fabrication on your part.  

If you've got a problem with this topic being brought up, it's you who did
it, so take your concerns to the mirror.

Me, I'm out of this.

"All I can say is that Joe REALLY doesn't know how to take a sarcastic
comment in good stride!"

Maybe, in future, if you didn't just drop in "sarcastic comments"
randomly, you wouldn't have problems like this.  Every time I have made a
positive comment about the EFX this season, you have jumped in with
sarcasm.  Grow up, Mojo.

Meanwhile, as far as I'm concerned, this thread is over.
