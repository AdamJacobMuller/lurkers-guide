"Was this your intention - to get a response from those of us who follow
the Sheridan and Delenn story line closely? Some how, I feel manipulated
and very disappointed."

Yes, as I sat in the editing room, I thought, "Hmmm...if I do this, it'll
get the Sheridan and Delenn fans' knickers all in a knot...."

Every scene goes through some editing...there is barely a scene we film
that doesn't get a line or two or three snipped.  Sometimes the edit is
noticeable, sometimes it ain't.  The only thing you can decide is, "Does
this move the story along or not?"  I was chasing about another 20 seconds
(which was all we're talking about here), and the back-and-forth didn't
really add anything to what was already in that scene.  I treated it the
same as I would treat any other scene.
