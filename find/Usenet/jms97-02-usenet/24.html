11 Feb 1997<PRE>"Can you tell us if Crusade is going to be a definite length eg B5
is/was supposed to be 5 years (still hanging on for season 5
announcement and sadly for season 4 to start showing in UK)."

There's a definite ending in mind, yes, but there's some room to play
within that framework.  Again, there's an arc, but not quite as rigorous
as with B5.
