<H2>Re: Atonement; slight spoiler</H2>
26 Feb 1997<PRE>"My question is, since we can see that the ship's engine is running, why
aren't all of the objects in the hold laying against the bulkhead as a
result of the ship's movement?  Aside from that, it was a pretty neat
effects shot."

Because it's accurate; it's the same reason you don't see everything
slammed up against the back wall of the shuttle even though it's circling
the earth at thousands of miles per hour.
