<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: You really depress me</H2>
21 Feb 1997<PRE>If it's a little close to home...you have to remember I came out of
journalism, that was where I cut my teeth as a writer, working for
newspapers and magazines.  You see a lot of the tricks, some good, some
not so good, used for purposes that are sometimes good or not so good,
distortions on the left and distortions on the right. So it wasn't hard to
just tweak it a bit.

Thing to remember, though, is that this isn't ISN as we've known it in the
past, at least not to this extreme.  If anything, this ep should point to
the difference between journalism, albeit biased, and propaganda, which is
all ISN is now, and how only an informed viewership can prevent the one
from sliding into the other.
