<H2>Re: ATTN: JMS or GEORGE--Questions about ISN cameras</H2>
25 Feb 1997<PRE>Jeff-

The ISN cameras are not capable of autonomous operation, but they can be
progammed within a parameter set.  The wand is a control device to
change those parameters.  Thus, one operator, two cameras (or more!)

There was a distinct anti Minbar/Minbari sentiment among this particular
crew, as evidenced by the later parts of the show, and it isn't hard to
imagine that the bumping was at the behest of the wand wielder.  If
Lennier was simply annoyed, advantage ISN.  If he reacted violently,
advantage ISN. I'm sure that footage will be used on another ISN
propoganda broadcast.  (You can see it on Channel 134 of your cable)(Oh,
sorry, Channel 134 is not availbale in all sectors after curfew)
