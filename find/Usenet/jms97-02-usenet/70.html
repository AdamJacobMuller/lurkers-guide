27 Feb 1997<PRE>Andras-

Cineon is not the only processor to have a grain remover/grain adder
module in the software.  The discreet logic Flint, Adobe After Effects,
and Lightwave 3D used on B5 also have various modules and plugins for
grain manipulation.  We use 'em all the time on composite and blue
screen shots to make the generated elements fit into the film elements.

We shoot with Panavision Gold super 35.  We have tested nearly all of
the emultions currently available, and 5298 is what John Flinn III, ASC
likes the best, so that is what we use.  He feels it preserves the look
he is going for the best.  I know an EXR test was scheduled, but we
haven't gotten there yet.

We record all of our CG elements to hard drive and optical disc.  The
images are created "resolution independent" meaning they could be
rendered for anything from video game to Imax, based on user input.  For
the NTSC version, we output to digital tape, eventually.

Hey, advertise Kodak all you want, they make good film.  Love that
Kodachrome, even thogh it's disappearing.

CoProducer, B5
