<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Question about B5 novels</H2>
20 Feb 1997<PRE>"Is this book consistant with what happened to Sinclair in the first few
issues of the DC comic? Or is the DC comic now non-canon?"

It's *absolutely* consistent with the comic, the events of which are
mentioned at some length in the novel.  I'm telling you...it ties in the
comics, the first year, the following year, the development of the
Rangers, what happened to Marcus and his brother, what happened to
Catherine Sakai, we learn a lot more about Valen...it's going to be pretty
cool.
