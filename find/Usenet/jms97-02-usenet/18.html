8 Feb 1997<PRE>The early information on Vorlons was just put in there to make the studio
happy, since I didn't want to reveal what they were -- it'd be kinda hard
to explain to business types -- because they wanted *something* to hold
onto.  The same material includes drawings done again just to help them
relax.
