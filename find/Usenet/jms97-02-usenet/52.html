<H2>Re: ATTN:JMS-New comics?</H2>
21 Feb 1997<PRE>Yes, here's the skinny: 

There's going to be a new 3-part story arc for the comics.  It'll first
appear in the UK, serialized in the B5 magazine (which will be regularly
published over there shortly, to coincide with new episodes), then it will
be gathered together and published in the US by DC Comics.  The books are
being written/assembled in-house, to avoid conflicts with editors.

I've written the first issue, which brings the Valen story into the
foreground, and the second two parts are being written by Peter David.
