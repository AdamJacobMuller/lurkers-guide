<H2>Re: Attn JMS: audio problem during "The Illusion of Truth"</H2>
24 Feb 1997<PRE>Hey Folks-

The audio problem on TIoT was caused by the uplink at the uplink
facility that Warners is using this year.  This facility is not all
digital, like our facility was last year, and these analog-y problems
creep in from time to time.  The buzzing mentioned happened specifically
on the "hypertext" captions (tell the truth, how many people touched the
button pads?), and was caused by the audio channel being too close to
video with a high white level.  (Video pro alert- yes i know this is an
overly simplified explanation) 

WB is in the process of fixing the problem.

Any of the other mentioned problems, voices shooting off into the
surrounds, steering effects in stereo, dialog level fluctuations are a
local phenomenon.
