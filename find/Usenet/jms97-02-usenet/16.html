<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Only on Babylon 5 . . . (no ITF spoilers)</H2>
7 Feb 1997<PRE> 1.) The CGI was excellent and seemed very different than in previous
episodes, much larger, better defined, darker.  Was this an effort on
your part, or the post-production department?

We're trying some new rendering techniques...I think they're working very
well.  (Some of the stuff in the next episode has a very realistic feel to
it.)

  2.) Have you found some way to slow down time or compress the episode
into a shorter span?  When I finished this one, I swore I had watched a
two hour movie.

You did.  We arranged for a time dilation bubble to appear over your
house.

  3.) Any reaction from the actor or staff on this one?  Especially, Ed
Wassner? (Might be a bit of spoilers in the answer to this one)

Ed wants to come back as an alien.  I see no problem with this.
