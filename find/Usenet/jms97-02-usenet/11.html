4 Feb 1997<PRE>We use the Hubble images (provided by them) a lot on the show, including
these current couple of episodes.  We digitize them, then enhance them
into 3D.

There aren't any official B5 paintings going on now, the only artwork of a
collector's sort now is the collector's plate series from Hamilton, which
is very nice (the Delenn plate in particular is *gorgeous*).
