<H2>Re: Attn GEORGE: Interceptors</H2>
24 Feb 1997<PRE>Mark-

The interceptors have two components, one that throws a ball of energy
at an incoming weapons charge (physical or energy) and causes
dissipation, and the other is a net-like energy web that reduces the
severity, but does not deflect or absorb, beam type energy.  This allows
some time for maneuvers after beam contact.  

Note that Major Ryan (He'll always be D-Day to my brother!) was very
reticent to fire on the Clarkstown at all.  Knowing that the
Interceptors were down made his job all the more difficult.  The rear
facing beamn on the Alexander is similar in design to the front facers
on the Clarkstown.  When the C-town fired on the rotating section ofthe
Alexander, it did not explode, as the interceptors were still active.
