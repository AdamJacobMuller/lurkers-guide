16 Feb 1997<PRE>My suspicion is that they're dropping the B5 promo into what was the Kung
Fu promo spot, since KF ain't no more.  They can't put in any more
commercials because they're up to the maximum limit, and most fans have
indicated wanting to see the longer promo not the short one, which is
often cut off.
