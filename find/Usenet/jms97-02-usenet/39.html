<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Question about B5 novels</H2>
16 Feb 1997<PRE>In the past, we've taken pitches, but overall I've felt that the books
strayed too far from canon by doing it that way; the latest batch were
more directly influenced.  One is taken right out of B5 canon, the
Anna/Icarus story, and it's one of the best to date; the second one up is
based on a premise I wrote up and was assigned to the writer (it's the
weakest of the three, set on Centauri Prime while G'Kar was still held
prisoner, but still okay); the third is also based on a premise, and
follows Sinclair after leaving B5 to form the Rangers...I worked very
closely with the writer here to ensure that virtually *every line* is
canon.  Frankly, if anyone asks from now on, "What happened to Sinclair
after leaving B5?" I can point to this book and say, honestly, "It's all
in there."

I think we'll continue to work this way more in future.

Dell only works with published authors with agents and credits.
