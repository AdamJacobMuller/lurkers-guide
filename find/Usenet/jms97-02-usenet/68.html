<H2>Re: ATTN JMS:  Can you elaborate on Netter Digital Press Release?</H2>
27 Feb 1997<PRE>Happy to explain.

"And now this letter comes out from your company which seems to imply
there won't be a fifth season."

NDEI is not my company.  I don't own it, don't work for it, it's entirely
Doug's separate company.  With a stockholder's meeting coming up, he told
his financial PR person to pump out a release to get a little heat
going...and there was the TNT deal to pick up the B5 episodes that clicked
over at 88 episodes.  That is the point at which they can get the show
clean, and there's the two movies for TNT to announce as go projects.  

The financial PR person put this out, rather than the B5 publicists, or
WB, and it never went in front of me or John Copeland.  It just went out. 
That TNT gets access to 88 doesn't preclude a possible season 5, which
could air concurrently, a la the way Lazarus Man did.  

When I came in and found email on this, and saw the release, I raised hell
with Doug about it.  He said "the entire 88 episodes" just refers to
what's solid right now, it doesn't mean it's going to be all there is...to
which I said it could be read that way, and many people *were* reading it
that way, and his person could've saved everyone a lot of hassle if it'd
been run past me first.

One thing's for sure: This Will Never Ever Happen Again.
