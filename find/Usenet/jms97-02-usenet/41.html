<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: 14th April for season 4 in UK?</H2>
16 Feb 1997<PRE>"I had written to them about the repeats of Season 1 (which we're not
getting in Wales) and after explaining that their commitment to Welsh
langauge programming did not allow them sufficient airtime for as many
repeats as the main C4, they went on to say, "However, you'll be glad to
know that the next series has been provisionally scheduled to start on
the 14th April 1997 on Channel 4. That series will definitely be shown
by S4C, although I am unable to give you a date and time at present.""

This is the first time I've heard a specific date, so I can't comment with
any kind of competence one way or another...I can only nod wisely, as if I
knew what the hell was actually going on....
