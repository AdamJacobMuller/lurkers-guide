<H2>Re: ATTN: JMS - Choice of Music in "The Long Night"</H2>
3 Feb 1997<PRE>It's not exactly a question of choosing the music: I sit with Chris
Franke, our composer, and indicate, "Here's where the music starts, and
ends."  If it's source music, we discuss the type of music, and he then
composes it.  We don't choose from library stuff on the show.
