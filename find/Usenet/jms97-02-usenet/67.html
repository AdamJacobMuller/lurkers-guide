No, the Netter release categorically does NOT state that there will not be
a fifth season, only that TNT has the rights to the 88 episodes and is
hoping to get them on ASAP...but we're told by WB that this does not
preclude year 5, which would (in the case of renewal) run in syndication
cuncurrently with the reruns on TNT.
