<H2>Re: ATTN: JMS--Pushing the Envelope (SPOILERS, Into the Fire)</H2>
9 Feb 1997<PRE>Thanks.  Now comes more fun...again, it's all about process...going from
post-war (Minbari) to an uneasy peace, to showing how a war starts to come
about, the actual beginning of a war, its progress, then the aftermath. 
That arc really is at the core of the show...the changes that take place
through this process.
