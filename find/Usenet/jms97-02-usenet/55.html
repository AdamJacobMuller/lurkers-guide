<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: New book?</H2>
22 Feb 1997<PRE>Thanks.  I'm loathe to say too much about the book for now, because I tend
to prefer to talk about these things closer to completion, so I know it's
something that will *happen*.  I can say for now only that it's an SF
novel, probably with a good mainstream appeal to it, in a contemporary
setting.  I'm not able to work on it as much or as often as I'd like,
stealing away a few hours here and there, but I'm about 100 pages into it
now, and hope to have it done by the end of the year.
