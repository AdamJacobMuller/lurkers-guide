<H2>Re: ATT JMS:  Proportions of writing</H2>
12 Feb 1997<PRE>Thanks...at last, I'm well proportioned....

I've always preferred the arc, both inside an episode, and between
episodes, and even in the course of a season, where there's the resolution
and then there's time to consider, reflect, and show the impact of these
things.  It's not just about solving the technical problem that way...it's
about the people who solve the problem and how they are affected by the
problems and solutions.
