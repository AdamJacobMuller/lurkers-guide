<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Revellogram model kits</H2>
8 Feb 1997<PRE>I saw the ad copy for the first batch of models when they came through my
office for approval...the Starfury is going to be one of the first ones
out, and if the ad just came through, then it means they're about to start
marketing it, so I'd keep my eyes open.
