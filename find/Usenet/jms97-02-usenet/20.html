<H2>Re: ATTN: JMS   &lt;spoilers for #406&gt;</H2>
9 Feb 1997<PRE>Ghar...your comments are well and good and have nothing to do with
reality.

First, the Rangers situation is not a typical military situation.  They
are primarily from Minbar, both in terms of actual Minbari and humans
trained there.  They are specifically under Delenn's charge, with Sheridan
*sharing* that authority.  He did not know Ericsson because they're a
large bunch to whom he has not been introduced, and likely they don't have
very large records on them.  This is a *de facto* army, not a *de jure* (I
hope I spelled that right) army...there ain't a lot of paperwork on the
Rangers.

Second, it was Delenn who sent for this particular White Star, more for
its strategic location...which Sheridan used because it was closest to the
goal.  Your observation is like saying that General Patton should know
*instantly* about every soldier on the line in battle, however distant he
is.  Which is simply absurd.  Watch some old WW2 footage someday...there's
General MacArthur walking among some troops..."What's your name, son? 
Where are you from?"  By your lights, he should have known that.  

Third, re: the encryption notice...of *course* they're all
encrypted...what Sheridan said was "we're RE-encrypting this message EVERY
THREE SECONDS, so be sure to have your system keep up."  That's an
escalation in layers of encryption so elaborate and involved that it makes
the system actually slow down.

Before you start flaming, I suggest you stop and consider what you're
saying some time, and that there may be other elements at work beyond just
what you THINK should be the case.
