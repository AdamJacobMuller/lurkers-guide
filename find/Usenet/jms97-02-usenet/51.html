<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Crusade/B5 ending?  ** SPOILERS**</H2>
21 Feb 1997<PRE>"You have pretty consistently said that you would *end* B5, and that there
would *never* be a sequel.  Instead, you would do something in the B5
universe, but not realated to the B5 storyline.  The description sure
sounds like a sequel to me."

What I have said about this from the beginning, and the ONLY thing I have
ever said about this, was that there was a side-story in the B5 universe
that could go off from the main story.  That has been quoted in many
different places, and on line, and definitely includes any plans for
"Crusade."

BTW, that new characters were mentioned does not exclude any current cast
members...doesn't include them, either, but bottom line, that ain't a
complete list of characters.  There's room and flexibility in there,
depending on what happens.
