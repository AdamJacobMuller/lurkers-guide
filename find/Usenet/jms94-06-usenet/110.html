18 Jun 1994<PRE>     Getting in someone else to play Sinclair would be the solution if
the actor were the problem.  He's not.  It's a question of looking at the
character (at least from my side of this) and saying, "Is there something
different we can do here that's more interesting?"  This isn't a question
of salvaging stuff.
