<H2>Re: Alleged JMS slam of TNG (R</H2>
9 Jun 1994<PRE>     Oh, please, if that's the best you can do.  You were asked to
provide a quote in which I slammed Trek fans.  That message you quoted
doesn't slam Trek fans.  It doesn't even MENTION Trek fans.  It refers to
a couple of people -- and there messages WERE geeky -- who got very snotty
and said that they had NEVER EVER used CGI on TNG, and that they could
tell (even though I know from inside that in at least one prior episode,
where Picard "joins" a band of crooks, they DID use a CGI ship in a
couple of shots).
 
     And you even admit that you aren't sure that it was directed at
Trek fans.  Which, again, it wasn't; only at a couple of specific people.
 
     Further, the "All Things...STUPID" header wasn't created by me, but
was on a thread created by somebody else.
 
     I have NEVER, in any post, slammed Trek fans as a group, and I don't
think I've ever just roundly dismissed/slammed ST as useless or sucky or
anything on that order.  If there was something specific to mention or to
critique, maybe, but frankly I don't recall doing much or any of THAT,
either.
 
     You made an allegation.  And now you can't back up that allegation
with anything.
 
     Perhaps an apology might be in order...?
 
                                                                       jms
