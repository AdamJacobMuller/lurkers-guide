<H2>JMS: How much did B5 cost and.</H2>
2 Jun 1994<PRE>     Doing a conversion of EA dollars in 2258 to US dollars 1994 is a
bit much for me to handle.  The EA was able to afford the first few on
their own, since they were attempts that didn't get very far, but later
had to accept Minbari and, later still, Centauri co-financing to make it
viable.
