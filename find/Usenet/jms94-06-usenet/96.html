<H2>Re: BABYLON 5-THE SCORES</H2>
17 Jun 1994<PRE>     What you address in the last bit of the music in "Signs" is what
I've been trying to get across.  The theme music appearing there is not
quite what we use otherwise.  I suggested to Chris that it'd be cool to
have the B5 theme there in *minor keys* or minor chords.  It's a somewhat
different version, and playing a theme in minor instead of major keys or
chords makes it somber, sad, unsettling.  We've just seen B5 explode, and
doing that particular riff on the theme seemed to both of us a good idea.
 Play it again, then the regular theme, and you'll see the difference.
