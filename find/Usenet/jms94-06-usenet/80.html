16 Jun 1994<PRE>     "Franke...is not cutting it..he's just not the right person for
the program."
 
     1) That's your opinion.  2) Your opinion is irrelevant.
 
     The job of a composer is to work with the material as written and
directed, to fit the vision of the person who's putting it together.
Christopher's music is *exactly* what I envisioned wanting for the show.
So he *is* exactly the right person for the show.  You don't get a vote
on that.
 
     And it's pretty cowardly for anyone to step up to the plate and
criticize others behind a pseudonym.  My real name's up here, why isn't
yours?
 
     From your comments, your sense that you are obligated to "take on"
me and other show runners, your grandiose sense of importance, your
insistence that the world is the way you say -- no live players even
though there are -- despite being repeatedly told otherwise, I would
almost be tempted to conclude that you are suffering from delusions of
grandeur...but I suspect that closer to the truth is that you are
suffering from delusions of adequacy.
 
     You are being an ass.  Go away.
