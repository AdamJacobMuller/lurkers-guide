20 Jun 1994<PRE>     OKAY, OKAY, SO CHRIST AND THE TWO ME'S WERE IN ON THE MUSIC SPOTTING
SECTION!  I ADMIT IT!  ANYBODY ELSE GOT A PROBLEM WITH THAT?
 
     ...sigh...I can't win.
 
     Typos have always been the bane of my existence.  I once did a humor
column for the university newspaper.  Did an Easter column.  Wrote,
"Celebrated Easter by running down a rabbit."  Okay, not great humor, but
what do you expect in college?  One problem: due to a typesetting typo,
the column comes out reading, "Celebrated Easter by running down a rabbi."
 
     The Jewish Student Union -- in the person of five very large men
waiting for me when I arrived, all unknowing, on campus the next
morning -- was *not* amused.
