22 Jun 1994<PRE>     I'm putting this here because, by virtue of my initials being here,
this should be a trivial enough thread for a trivial question.
 
     On the theory that we are all generally 8 people removed from
anyone else on the planet...an idle request.
 
     When I was living in San Diego from 1974-81, I knew a young woman
there named Liz Ochoa.  She's part Basque, red hair, a rose tattoo on her
left wrist, and in 1978 or so had a 3 year old son named (I believe)
Justin.  She lived in the northern part of San Diego around El Cajon.
 
     I lost track of her a number of years ago, and if anyone out there
happens to know her, just as an experiment, drop me a private note.
 
     Let's see if this really works.  (And nothing weird here; she was a
dear and good friend.)
 
                                                                        jms
