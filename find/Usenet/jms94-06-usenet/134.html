<H2>JMS: Why B5 isn't SF Pt 1</H2>
22 Jun 1994<PRE>     Dear Matthew:
 
     So I log onto GEnie and see in my gateway 300+ messages, many of them
titled "B5 Isn't SF", starting with a three-part meganote.  "Oh, no, not
another pointy-head starting an argument," I decide.  So I wait, and wait,
until I've cleared my desk, and I can sit down and decide whether or not to
do battle, or simply reply with, "So what's your point?"
 
     Then I read what's actually contained in your messages.
 
     I can't decide whether to laugh or drive a semi-truck over your
house.
 
     So I've decided to do both.
 
     See you in...oh...about an hour....
 
                                                                      jms
