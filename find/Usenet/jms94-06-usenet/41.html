<H2>Re: JMS: does this group affec</H2>
8 Jun 1994<PRE>     I have thus far changed about 3 or 4 minor elements because someone
posted what could constitute a story idea that came uncomfortably close to
what we were doing this season.  Fortunately, they were small things, and
didn't affect anything substantial, but it is kind of a pain in the ass.
 
     On the *other* hand...very often there are zillions of questions
here about the characters, the universe, history, all that.  A writer's
job in creating a universe is to try and think of every question, and
answer it.  But far more questions get asked here than I could ever think
of.  So, sometimes a question I'd never considered gets asked, I come up
with an answer, and now it's part of the show.
