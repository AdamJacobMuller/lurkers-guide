<H2>JMS: Re: TOYS! TOYS! TOYS!</H2>
4 Jun 1994<PRE>     I believe that's correct; the PPG consists of more than 20 pieces
of machined aluminum, which has two lighting systems, one when the
trigger is depressed (the barrel lights up, and a side light turns on),
and another when you slap in an energy charge pod at the back.
 
     I imagine that'll come out sooner or later (the plans).
