<H2>B5 and LOSH (or: Now I know wh</H2>
18 Jun 1994<PRE>     Yeah, but y'know, I just *hated* what they did to the Legion; it got
SO big and out of control that while I still buy the book (not really
knowing why), I can barely follow the thing.  I dunno, it just lost
something to me.  (Plus the artwork during the revamp was SO awful, and
you could never tell who you were looking at.)
