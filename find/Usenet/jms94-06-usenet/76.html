<H2>Att jms</H2>
16 Jun 1994<PRE>     To answer your questions in order...I use small initials jms because
it looks cool, and keeps me modest.  (Someone pointed out that it looks
like a derringer pointing right, but what do I know.)  Yes, we'll find
out about the Minbari situation re: Sinclair in the first episode of year
two.  And it will have future ramifications.  As for knowing what was
going on in "Sky"...bear in mind that you (and other net-surfers) have an
advantage 99.9% of the rest of the country does not: this conversation.
 
     That 99.9% didn't even *know* about the hole in Sinclair's mind
when "Sky" began because it hadn't ever been mentioned *in the series*
up to that point.  Only in the pilot, which the majority of B5's current
viewers never saw.  All of the discussions here lead netters to expect
stuff that the rest of the nation has never seen, and thus can't expect.
 
                                                                         jms
