18 Jun 1994<PRE>     Neil's turned down some script work because he's up to his eyes in
prior commitments, and doesn't take on stuff unless he feels strongly
that he can give it the proper amount of time to do a good job.  But he's
good enough to merit going back to again and again and again until he
surrenders....
