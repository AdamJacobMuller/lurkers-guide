<H2>Koenig was doing Shatner!</H2>
16 Jun 1994<PRE>     It's a funny thought, but knowing Walter as I do, I can say without
fear of contradiction that he was *not* doing Shatner.  Given the chance
here to do something *utterly* outside ST, which was his hope, and our
pleasure to provide, he wouldn't do this, and having spoken with him at
some length about his character and his performance, know that he *didn't*
do this.
