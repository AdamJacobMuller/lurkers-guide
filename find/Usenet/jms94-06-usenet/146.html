<H2>UK: PoD; See you next Wednesda</H2>
23 Jun 1994<PRE>     The line, "See you next wednesday," was basically an offhand line,
slightly but not significantly based in the idea that in most markets,
B5 airs on Wednesdays.  It was never meant to be a John Landis reference,
and if I'd known it was (I'd never heard it before), would've changed it.
 
     Not all of us in Hollywood have forgotten Vic Morrow.
