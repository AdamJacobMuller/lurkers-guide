<H2>ATT: JMS - The Pit Crew</H2>
19 Jun 1994<PRE>     In a way, I kinda thought it was more interesting to play the C&amp;C
techs as just that: they are their jobs as far as we can see.  To give
them a sense of being part of the machine.  They are occasionally referred
to in dialogue, but only by job: "Station one, transfer data to main
console."  I think we broke it down to one station each for environment,
jumpgate/navigational assistance, security and a couple of other areas.
