16 Jun 1994<PRE>     I *imagine* my presentation will be on that Saturday, but I have no
actual proof upon which to base that belief.  It is simply an act of
faith at this point.  Re: bringing down cast members...we'll be in the
thick of shooting, so I don't know who if anyone can make it (though Bill
Mumy will be there for his concert).
