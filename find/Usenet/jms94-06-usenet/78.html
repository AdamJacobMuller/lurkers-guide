16 Jun 1994<PRE>     "Is Kosh what he/she/it appears to be?"
 
     Kosh is always and forever *exactly* what he appears to be, no less
and no more.  At the same time, Kosh is absolutely *nothing* like what
he appears to be.
 
     These are not contradictory statements.
 
     And this is about the straightest answer I've given yet on the
subject, believe it or not.
