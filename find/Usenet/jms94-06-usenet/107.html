<H2>JMS: Main title for Season 2 o</H2>
18 Jun 1994<PRE>     Since the show will have to be promoted for year two, and there will
be articles all over the place, it's impossible for general viewers not
to know, so there's no sense having to make two different openings to
accomodate the first episode.
