16 Jun 1994<PRE>     There will be a new intro to year 2.  I would hope that the
opening narrative would be shorter.  Not ready yet to announce who's
going to be doing it.  It will probably include shots from years one and
two.
 
     Getting Patrick will depend on getting a script he likes.  It's
certainly one of my goals.
 
     And yes, there will be some new writers freelancing for us this
season; I'm talking to writers like Peter David, and Scott Frost (from
Twin Peaks and X-Files), a few others...and I'm going to keep hammering
at Neil Gaiman to do us a script until he finally does one just to make
me go away.
 
     No immediate committments to the prior three, but we're seeing what
we can do.
