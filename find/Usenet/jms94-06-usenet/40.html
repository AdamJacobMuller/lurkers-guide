<H2>Re: Commander Tomolok (sp?)</H2>
8 Jun 1994<PRE>     "B5 should be better than Trek's first season, jms has been able to
watch Trek for years before he made his show, and should have learned from
them."
 
      There are two things about this statement that make me absolutely
fucking nuts.
 
     1) There's this attitude that I see again and again that's somewhat
confrontational, often from ST fans, that we have to do *better* than
ST (and usually in ways that they feel can be measured against ST, even
though it's a different series).  Some people say, "Well the characters
aren't as gritty as in NYPD Blue or Homicide," or "I'm tired of people
saying there's humor on the series, it doesn't compare with COACH."  It
seems like it's not enough that we be simply a *good* show, we have to be
THE BEST TEEVEE SERIES ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH IN ALL TEEVEE HISTORY or
we're crap.  Talk about moving the borders around....
 
     2) Re: watching and learning from ST...that's useful ONLY IF YOU'RE
DOING MORE ST.  It's a whole different universe, different characters,
different technologies, different rules.  It's like saying you should
watch LASSIE to learn how to do DRAGNET.  Or, to stay within genres,
watch DRAGNET to learn how to do NYPD Blue.
 
     B5 was conceived before TNG went on the air, btw.
