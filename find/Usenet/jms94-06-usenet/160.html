<H2>jms:  Civil liberties</H2>
28 Jun 1994<PRE>     Yes, there are definitely civil liberties.  In the specific
instance you cite, you're looking at a camera feed from a B5 facility,
which is as admissible as a videotape inside a supermarket; it's not a
question of putting it in an unauthorized area.  B5 is owned by EA.
 
     The whole question of how telepaths can be used gets very much into
issues of civil liberties and privacy; that's why they're prohibited from
unauthorized scans, and are not allowed to determine anyone's guilt or
innocence by a scan of the accused, since it violates the right to due
process.
 
     We've thought it out a lot, but it would fill up a lot of room here
to go over it in detail; perhaps best for now to let the show speak for
itself.  (You'll see some discussion of this upcoming in "The Quality of
Mercy," for starters.)
