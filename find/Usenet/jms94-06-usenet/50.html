<H2>"Mind War" -second thoughts</H2>
9 Jun 1994<PRE>     There's an awful lot there and most of it involves math, so I'm
going to have to puzzle this out.  But for the other stuff...no, there's
no in-joke in Sigma 957, but ***CONGRATULATIONS!***  You are the FIRST
person to pick up on the Native American line that Ironheart quotes when
he goes up against Kelsey.  (And yes, I believe it is ojibwe in origin.)
I've always considered it a very powerful line (a prayer of protection
against one's enemies), and wanted to use it.  That seemed the perfect
opportunity to do so.
