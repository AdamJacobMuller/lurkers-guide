<H2>Re: JMS : B5 CD?</H2>
28 Jun 1994<PRE>     I understand your concern; my sense is that, as a writer, my job is
to find the right word for the right job.  I could describe a character
as "dumb," but somehow "breathtakingly stupid" just sounds better.
 
     I could describe a car in a story as simply a car, or say that it's
a Mercedes 300E with silver finish and deep, plush seat linings.
 
     I could tell someone to simply go away...or "piss off."  And the
latter just tickles me a bit more.
 
     The right word for the right job.
 
                                                                  jms
