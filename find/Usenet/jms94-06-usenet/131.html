<H2>jms: I'd like to spec a script</H2>
20 Jun 1994<PRE>     I understand your dilemma; understand, though, that under Writers
Guild rules, I cannot encourage anyone or ask anyone or even participate
in the process of speccing a script.  Your question underlines the
problem I raised in my original message back.
