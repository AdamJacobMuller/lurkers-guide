16 Jun 1994<PRE>     Re: your continued allegations that B5's composer Chris Franke
"uses synthesizers in place of live players"...I am going to say this
just one more time: I don't care *what* your ears tell you; your ears are
hearing what you want to hear.  Chris uses both synth AND a live
orchestra.  He combines them.  What does it take to convince you?  I've
BEEN there.  I've SEEN the process.  It's ONGOING.  What you say is being
done is NOT what's being done.  Period.  You're pointing at a black wall
and saying it's white.  I'm not to blame for your problem with colors.
 
     You have two choices, one of which involves calling me a liar.
