<H2>JMS: Canada reference?</H2>
16 Jun 1994<PRE>     So it's okay by you to mention that Canada was wiped out by the great
genetics plague of 2134, and has been cut off from the rest of the world,
the few remaining mutants kept out behind barbed wire and gun turrets, you
really *want* I should mention that...?
