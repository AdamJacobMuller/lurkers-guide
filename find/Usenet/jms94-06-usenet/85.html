<H2>Re: BABYLON 5-THE SCORES</H2>
16 Jun 1994<PRE>     "I've stated that what I put forth was an opinion based on my years
of working in the business of music for films and TV programs."
 
     How can you say that when you operate under a pseudonym?  How do WE
know you have "years" working in the music business?  We have no proof
of this.
 
     "I've answered your questions with facts."
 
     No you haven't.  Not one.  Just more opinions.
 
     "I DON'T HEAR AN ORCHESTRA AT ALL IN THE SHOW!"
 
     So what?  That's your problem.
 
     This is like two guys standing in a zoo, looking at an elephant.
 
     "That's a duck," one says.
 
     "No it's not, it's an elephant."
 
     "I don't see an elephant.  I have experience.  It's a duck."
 
     "I don't *care* what YOU see, it's an elephant.  Look, see that
thing in front?"
 
     "What?  Its bill?"
 
     "That's not a bill, it's a trunk!  See how it waves back and forth?"
 
     "Oh, well, then it's a broken bill...pity, you think they could
afford to fix it."
 
     "Look, tell you what, how about I put your head under the 'duck's'
foot and see what happens...?"
 
     We're not responsible for your problems with perception and tone
deafness.
