<H2>Re: lack-luster characterizati</H2>
8 Jun 1994<PRE>     What do I know about alcoholics, to portray them?  Well, aside from
a degree in clinical psychology, and some internship work in the area, I
come from a family with alcoholism going back at least four generations,
and I'm talking *heavy duty*.  I am, in fact, the first male Straczynski
in my branch of this particular stunted tree NOT to have this problem.
 
     I have had far, far, far more experience with this area than I care
to recite...and from that perspective, I have no problem with Garibaldi's
portrayal.
