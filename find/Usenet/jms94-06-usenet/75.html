16 Jun 1994<PRE>     "The CD gift was nice I'm sure, but let's be honest it also sounds
like he's sucking up a lot too.  Just remember who signs his paychecks."
 
     Could you *possibly* be more smarmy about this?
 
     FYI, a *number* of people got these gift CDs, a very small group
that -- however this may surprise you -- includes people who do not pay
him.  Chris has no reason to "suck up" to anyone.  He's already on for
year two, his negotiations for the soundtrack with Warners have no impact
on us and we have no say in it...it was simply something done out of the
goodness of his heart, and his enthusiasm for the show.
 
     For someone who sets himself up as in a position to go after other
people, you sure engage in some dubious observations.
