<H2>Key questions to be answered</H2>
27 Jun 1994<PRE>     Without commenting one way or another on various speculations, let
me dive in for a second on the general issue of "what means what."
 
     One of the things I learned doing other shows, like being on "Murder,
She Wrote" for two years, was that you *must* play fair with the
audience.  The clues cannot be so small, or so diminished, that they will
zip by too easily.  There has to be at least a reasonable chance that
people will glom onto things.
 
     So the odds are that a single word, or a look, or something going on
in deep background is probably *not* significant.  Anything in foreground,
which is given some weight, *may* be significant.
