24 Jun 1994<PRE>     Re: "The Real Ghostbusters"...that show was a great deal of fun to
work on.  I'm pleased that it continues to get mentioned and noticed by
people.  (And the number of SF people who worked on it is actually quite
interesting...Richard Mueller, Michael Reaves, JM DeMatteis, John
Shirley, Arthur Byron Cover and others, in addition to the aforementioned
David Gerrold.)
 
     It was a show we were all free to go totally gonzo with, and it was
a ball, occasional fights with suits notwithstanding.  We got away with
some amazing stuff.  The bunch of episodes I wrote for TRGBs was pretty
much the end of my involvement in animation, and I kinda wanted to go out
with a bang.
