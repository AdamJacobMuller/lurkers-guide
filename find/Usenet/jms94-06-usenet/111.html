<H2>Re: Message from JMS</H2>
18 Jun 1994<PRE>     This to Patrick Rannou...I'm going to try this again, and see if it
sticks.
 
     We DO have options on our actors.  We DO and DID have options on
O'Hare.  It was WE who first approached HIM, not the other way around.
Your characterization of his actions here is not only inappropriate, but
absolutely and catagorically untrue.  If you've got a problem, you've got
a problem with me, not Michael.
 
     Once again: this was MUTUAL, and it was AMICABLE.
