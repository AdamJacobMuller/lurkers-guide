<H2>Babylon 5 is scary.</H2>
29 Jun 1994<PRE>     Then it's having its intended effect.  To me, the best SF has always
left me with an uncertain feeling, as of having touched something quite
extraordinary.  (Being young and discovering H.P. Lovecraft for the first
time can REALLY do that to you, yikes!)  I try to build in a little of
that same sense...the flip-side of the sense of wonder.
 
     Humans have definitely had a rough time of it lately, in the B5
storyline.  But we're going somewhere now, as our arc begins to shift.
We have always struggled upward.  And there are some very interesting
things in store for humans in the B5 universe....
