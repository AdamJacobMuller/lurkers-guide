30 Jun 1994<PRE>     RE: mental powers...there's still investigation into this area
going on, and I don't think we've yet heard the final judgment...jump
gates are a fairly reasonable extrapolation on folded space, wormholes
and the like...and as for FTL travel, there isn't any, none of our ships
travel faster than light per se; hyperspace is one way of avoiding the
whole issue.  In normal space, none of the ships in the B5 universe
travel faster than light.
