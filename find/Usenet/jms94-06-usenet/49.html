<H2>B5 Newsletter - What Happened</H2>
8 Jun 1994<PRE>     OKAY!  OKAY!  I'LL WRITE THE GODDAMNED ESSAY THAT CHRISTY MARX HAS
BEEN NAGGING ME TO WRITE FOR THE LAST MONTH OR TWO OR THREE OR WHO EVEN
REMEMBERS WITH HER AFTER A WHILE, JUST THIS CONSTANT DRONING, ON AND ON
AND ON, "WRITE THE ESSAY, WRITE THE ESSAY, WRITE THE ESSAY," AND I TELL
HER I'VE BEEN BUSY, I'VE BEEN NUTS, GO AWAY, I'M TRYING TO MAKE A SERIES
HERE GODDAMNIT, BUT NOOOOOO, SHE JUST KEEPS ON COMING, WON'T STOP, AND
NOW SHE'S SENDING HER AGENTS OF DARKNESS AFTER ME, THAT'S IT, YOU'RE
WORKING FOR HER, AREN'T YOU, TELL THE TRUTH, I'VE SEEN HER OUTSIDE MY
WINDOW AT NIGHT, WATCHING, WATCHING....
 
     I am in *desperate* need of a vacation....
