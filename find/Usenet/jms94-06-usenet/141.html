<H2>AtSFoS: ***Differences?*** (JM</H2>
23 Jun 1994<PRE>      No, there were no changes in the Sinclair ship-yank scene; what you
may be remembering is a shot some magazine ran a while back which used a
shot we discarded, which was a lot like what you describe.  The guys at
Foundation called it the "snot shot," because that's kinda what it looked
like (hence why we didn't use it).
