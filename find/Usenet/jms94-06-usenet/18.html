<H2>Re: ST:TNG episode "Believers"</H2>
4 Jun 1994<PRE>     "who sincerely hopes that JMS posts a clarification/retraction of
his slams of the opposition...."
 
     Please reprint for me the "slams" that you say I have posted, and
then show me where they are in error.  If a misstatement of facts was
ever made, I will retract it.  If not, not.  I will not take back any
criticism just because you don't like it, and further, in my postings I
generally make it a point *not* to slam.  So, again, please repost those
messages for me.  Otherwise, as far as I'm concerned, I have nothing to
retract.
 
     Second, to the point of your message...we *showed* what happened:
the raiders came out of nowhere.  She turned around.  Hit her engines, and
ran.  We SEE her turn and run.  What in this is so incomprehensible to you
that you felt you needed it *explained*?  And in the midst of the main
story in "Believers" cranking rapidly toward its end, what would have been
served by cutting away one more time just to show her running and firing
backward as she ran?
 
     We show nearly everything on this show; almost *nothing* happens off
camera...as opposed (okay, you want a slam, here's one) to one episode of
TNG that I recall where there was some kind of disturbance they were
investigating, they were hit by the vortex (never saw it), the other ship
(which we never saw) was hit by it, the ship was destroyed (we never saw
it)...the whole THING was one big radio drama, with the crew narrating
what happened rather than showing it to us.
 
     In 14 episodes, we chose to let *one* incident happen off-camera,
and it was a dramatic choice, leaving something to the imagination of the
viewers, and to avoid interfering with a very dramatic moment in the main
story.
 
     Deal with it.
 
                                                                   jms
