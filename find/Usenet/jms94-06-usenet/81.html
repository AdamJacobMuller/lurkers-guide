16 Jun 1994<PRE>     Once agan, Franke's approach to the show is not "wrong."  What you
are doing is like walking into someone's home, which is decorated to
their tastes, and saying it's "wrong" because it's not how you would
decorate your house.  You don't get a vote.  It is right for what I want
to do for my show, and so it is right.  Only one person gets a vote on
what does and doesn't "fit" with this show.  And it ain't you.
