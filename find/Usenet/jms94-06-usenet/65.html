<H2>JMS!!  What are the rules?</H2>
15 Jun 1994<PRE>     Of the options you listed, only D poses a real problem; A-C are
more or less okay.  The problem comes not so much from speculating on
elements already introduced, as introducing *new* plot elements that
have not been seen in the show to back up speculation or conjecture,
which may or may not approximate what we're doing.  "The Minbari
surrendered because in some episode we'll see someday the Earth had
developed a giant killer space duck hidden on the dark side of the
moon that would nibble the Minbari homeworld to destruction."  That is
kind of the dividing line between what's safe and not-safe.
