<H2>UK: People missing the point.</H2>
24 Jun 1994<PRE>     You don't have to read another book to "get it" re: psi's making
love.  Perhaps her problem was more with the making love part than the
psi part.  Haven't read Julian May's book.  It's just the obvious answer
to what happens if and when telepaths make love: if they truly open up,
then you're going to get a mirror effect.  Have your lady friend stand
between two mirrors and look at the effect.  This ain't rocket science.
