<H2>ATTN JMS: Rules for submitting</H2>
23 Jun 1994<PRE>     We cannot take any outside ship designs for legal reasons.  We hae
(have) contracted with Foundation to provide designs on a work for hire
basis, meaning we go in owning it, rather than buying designs after the
fact, which gets into rights and ownership questions, buyouts and the
like.  Even offered freely, we really can't do that (and even so, I have
this problem with people working for free).
