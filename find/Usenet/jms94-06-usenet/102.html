18 Jun 1994<PRE>     I was referring to ST purists, not ST purism, the latter of which is
applicable to many, the former of which refers only to a few.  One of the
things we get faulted on is that we're just not ST, and don't do things
the same way ST does things, from music to props to stories, you name it.
It's to that small group that I was referring.
