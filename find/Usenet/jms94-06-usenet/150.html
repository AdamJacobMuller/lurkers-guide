<H2>Re: JMS : B5 CD?</H2>
24 Jun 1994<PRE>     Lemme get this straight...you come on here, insult and slam Chris
Franke's music, accuse him of minor theft, fraud (by way of saying that
he is NOT using the orchestra that we're paying him to use), and being
talentless...and *then* you can actually come in here and demand to know
what label his CD is coming out on?
 
     Screw you...wait in line like everybody else.
