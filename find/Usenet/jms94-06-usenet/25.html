<H2>Editorial: Michael O'Hare's De</H2>
6 Jun 1994<PRE>     As it turns out, Michael O'Hare came by the office today, and we
spoke at some length about this issue.  Michael has offered to compose
a note confirming all that we've spoken about here, though I still don't
think it's necessary.
 
     There is no contradiction at work here.  Michael very much believes
in the show, and wants it to continue.  So do we.  As far as writing
campaigns are concerned, it's one thing to support a show, and another
thing to attack.  Cynthia Lieberman, for instance, has nothing -- let me
repeat, NOTHING -- to do with the running of Babylon 5, casting, or any
other aspect.  She is in Warners public relations.
 
     If you've got a problem, then your problem is with me.
 
     In addition, people keep seeing this as a cut-and-dried situation.
It isn't.  The reason Michael was here today was so we could film a piece
that will appear later in season two, and will set up the framework for
further appearances by Sinclair down the road.
 
     If you send a lot of letters to Warner Bros., to the *wrong person*
no less, all you will end up doing is pissing off Warner Bros., and with
good cause.  And the rebound effect would be to hurt Michael, and hurt
the show.
 
     Now, if fans want to write in noting how much they enjoyed Michael
as Sinclair, and that they would enjoy seeing him again down the road,
that I have no problem with.  It's only the "WHY DID YOU DO THIS I HATE
YOU YOU EVIL BASTARDS" kind of letter that can come out in this kind of
situation that I've discouraged.  If people want to say they'd like to
see Sinclair again on the show...that they enjoyed his performance...fine,
because that's certainly what we figure on doing at various points.
 
     Meanwhile, there's no one at Warner Bros. to complain *to*.  The
ultimate action came from this office, and you should address any
problems to me directly.  Or to Michael, who will be hitting the
conventions over the next several months, and can certainly speak for
himself.
 
                                                                  jms
