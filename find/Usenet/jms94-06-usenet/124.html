<H2>Re: JMS: Do a UK convention?</H2>
19 Jun 1994<PRE>     Actually, no, the May/June reference was to 1994, not 1995; I'd hoped
to get away before we began really cranking on this season.  I do hope to
get away next year, 1995, around April/May to the UK.  Later than that is
not workable due to production (assuming we get year 3).
