<H2>JMS: Do a UK convention?</H2>
18 Jun 1994<PRE>     I'd actually planned on visiting England in May/June for two weeks,
partly for vacation, partly for any PR work I could do for B5, but the
workload kinda precluded that.  I certainly have no objections, should the
opportunity arise, to do a UK con; I've visited England before, and enjoy
it quite a bit.  Will take any excuse to go there.
