<H2>Prepared for early cancellatio</H2>
30 Jun 1994<PRE>      The only way I've been able to get B5 to the TV screen at *all* ahs
(has) been to totally deny any other possibilities; I can't even consider
or discuss them.  The story will all eventually be told, that much I'm
determined about.  I feel the same way you do; it's always the shows I
like that get canceled...but so far we're doing okay, and we can only
hope for the best.
