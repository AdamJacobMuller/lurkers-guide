<H2>No change in new Mind War &lt;was</H2>
16 Jun 1994<PRE>     We discovered, when we went to put in the revised CGI, that the
international versions had already been made and transferred, and it would
be nearly impossible to recall that part of the process...so it was left
alone rather than have multiple versions of the same episode floating
around.
