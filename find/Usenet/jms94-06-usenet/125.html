<H2>jms: I'd like to spec a script</H2>
19 Jun 1994<PRE>     This is something I'm really trying not to encourage, for all the
reasons cited previously, plus the fact that we're trying to go with well
known SF pros and established writers.  But if you're going to do it, the
only way *to* do it is to have it submitted by an agent, through our story
editor Larry DiTillio.
