<H2>Why a jumpgate at Sigma 957?</H2>
18 Jun 1994<PRE>     An Explorer-class vessel looks for areas that look like likely
prospects for exploitation, or which are good for logistical or other
reasons, do a fast survey, drop a gate and move on.  Nobody *knew* about
the problems in Sigma 957 until well after the gate was in place.
 
     Generally, the race that builds the gate, owns it.
