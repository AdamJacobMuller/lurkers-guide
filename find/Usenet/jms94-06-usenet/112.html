<H2>JMS: About writing for B5?</H2>
18 Jun 1994<PRE>     The problem becomes that, the deeper we get into the series, the
more continuity there is between episodes, and the more you pretty much
have to know what's coming the rest of the season to write episodes for
the show.  Right now, all the scripts currently in the works have been
assigned out on the basis of premises developed by me, because I'm the
only one who knows where the hell the ship is going, particularly in light
of the new character(s) coming in.  What I'm doing is looking at some
spec scripts, determining if they've got what it takes, and assigning out
stuff; we're *not* looking for outside stories.
