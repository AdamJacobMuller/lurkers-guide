<H2>Re: JMS : B5 CD?</H2>
27 Jun 1994<PRE>     I didn't answer your first demand for information because I didn't
feel like it, and I don't have to.  You repeated the demand, and I told
you to piss off.  Lots of people here asked what *your* "credentials"
are in music...I don't see you responding to *their* requests, why the
hell should anyone honor yours?
 
     There will be a mountain of publicity on all the B5 licensing that
will be coming out later this fall.  The CD (as opposed to the CD Rom)
will be out in November, which is plenty of time yet for those who like
the music to find out.
 
     So it's a question of waiting two weeks to inform the fans of the
show...or annoying you now in the present.
 
     I opt for the latter.
 
                                                                 jms
