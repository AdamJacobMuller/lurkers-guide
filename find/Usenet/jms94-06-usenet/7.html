2 Jun 1994<PRE>     Correct, there are several different kinds of starfuries and models
of fighters; the standard lightweight version used at B5; the more stealth
oriented Black Omega fighters; and in the two-parter, you'll see the heavy
military class, with turrets fore and aft, and pilots fore and aft.
