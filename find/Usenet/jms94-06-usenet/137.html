<H2>Pronunciation? Help!</H2>
22 Jun 1994<PRE>     The *correct* pronunciation, the Old World version, would indeed
be "stra-chin-ski," though I don't worry about that since nobody should
ever have to worry about looking at a CZ and pronouncing it CH.  The
Americanized version is "stra-zin-ski."  Which is more than fine, and is
in fact what I use.
