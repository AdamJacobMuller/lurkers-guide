<H2>Re: B5 Newsletter - What Happe</H2>
10 Jun 1994<PRE>     BTW...and I attach this here only because I'm still fuzzy on sending
new notes to the Internet...this Saturday, June 11, B5's own conceptual
consultant Harlan Ellison will be signing books in the San Diego area, at
Mysterious Galaxy Books, in the Claremont Shopping Center, from 2-5 p.m.
In addition, for those who buy a copy of Mephisto in Onyx or Mindfields,
and $25 in other books, there will be a reading by Harlan of a new short
story at 6 p.m.
 
     I'll also be there, on and off, hangin' around.
 
                                                                        jms
