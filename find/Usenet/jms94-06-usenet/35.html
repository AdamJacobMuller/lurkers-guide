<H2>YOOHOO!!! JMS!!!!</H2>
8 Jun 1994<PRE>     If you were to look at B5 realistically (which is kind of our goal),
the realities are that a Lieutenant-Commander would not be promoted into
that kind of position.  She's not *nearly* seasoned enough to be entrusted
with a diplomatic posting (and can you *imagine* her trying to be
diplomatic on a regular basis?).  So it'd have to be someone else.
