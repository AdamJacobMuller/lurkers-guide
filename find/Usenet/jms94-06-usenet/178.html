<H2>Re: The One-Armed Man</H2>
30 Jun 1994<PRE>     PS #1: as Brian O'Neill said, any lawyer in his right *mind* would
tell you that after filing a complaint, the #1 rule is, "SHUT UP!"  Do
not go around making public statements about it.  Doofus-activity #1 from
you.
 
     PS #2: I have not said anything to you that anyone else here has
not said, in some cases in far harsher terms that I have said it.  Since
you said that you now intend to sue *me*, you must now also sue *them*
as well.  Otherwise your suit becomes selective, and thus provably a
vendetta.  So now how many *more* are you going to sue?  Or threaten?  Or
harrass?  (I notice you accused the Doge of forging your mail, so I
suppose we're now broadening our scope to include charges of forgery.)
 
     You use threat of lawsuit to intimidate people, with *no* conception
of the law.  Doofus-activity #2.
 
     Would you now like to try for Doofus-activity #3, or go home now?
