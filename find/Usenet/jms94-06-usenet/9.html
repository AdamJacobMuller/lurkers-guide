2 Jun 1994<PRE>     1) It was felt that further emphasizing the personal stories would
help with that demographic.  This is not a problem for us, since having
established the universe of B5 in the first season, we were moving ni
(in) that direction anyway for year two (and, in fact, did go that way
already in the latter half of year one).
 
     2) No, no real changes planned in the arc.
 
     3) The O'Hare situation is an entirely different issue.
 
     4) Warner hasn't said a peep about the alternate lifestyles character,
despite many opporunities to do so.  You'll start to get a sense of this
character more in season two.
