<H2>[JMS READ!] Airschedule (say i</H2>
8 Jun 1994<PRE>     As it was explained to me by Warners, the HUT (Households Using
Televisions) figures for August are notoriously low.  Also, they said
that they thought that showing it once, then again in reruns that week,
and then again before the start of season two would "diminish" the
impact of what is, frankly, our best episode of the whole first season.
 
     So they want to play it just the week before year two starts.
 
     This ain't my decision, and I've debated it with WB until I've turned
blue in the face.  They still think it's a wonderful idea.  Their
motivation is only good.  I just don't agree that this is the best way to
do it; a cliffhanger is supposed to...well...leave you hanging.  I mean,
that's kind of in the description, innit?
 
     Sometimes studios, like god, transcend all understanding.
