<H2>TV Guide &amp; Fall Preview (was A</H2>
16 Jun 1994<PRE>     There are a number of people at TV Guide, including Jeff Jarvis, who
want *zero* references to B5 at worst, to slam it at best.  If we went on
the air in the spring again, they'd simply not mention us at all.  Does
anyone actually think they cover things based on *quality*?  They don't.
It's whoever buys the cover that week.  By going in the fall, they pretty
much *have* to at least mention us, so that's a start.  But that's not
the full reason; it has much also to do with rerun schedules and how you
make episodes stretch between sweeps periods.
