6 Feb 1998<PRE>Spoilers for The Paragon of Animals

























White Stars are not invulnerable.  If they saw what they were told were a
friendly fleet coming in, to join them in an offense, they would have their
defenses down.  And a full-scale Drazi fleet would also somewhat outnumber the
White Stars.  A Pearl Harbor style attack on White Stars would effectively
decimate the fleet before they would have a chance to respond.
