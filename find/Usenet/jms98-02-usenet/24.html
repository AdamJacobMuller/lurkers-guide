<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: How do you feel?</H2>
7 Feb 1998<PRE>&gt;Now that a major portion of your work
&gt;will be over are you not going to know what to do with all that free time?

What free time?  

&gt;You must feel relieved, sad, euphoric, and proud because that's what you've
&gt;done to me in just the first few episodes this season.  I bet you'll be able
&gt;to identify with how Sinclair would have felt if he'd stayed after year one,
&gt;being outside the action a little more. 

Certainly all those emotions and still others raced through me when I finished
typing the last words of episode 522 a few days ago.  There's no way to
describe it.

&gt;So what's left to do as Executive
&gt;Producer these next few weeks?   

Writing the next 2 movies, to be shot in April/May; doing all the other
production stuff (working with the various departments -- costume, prosthetics,
CGI, sets, directors, actors), post production stuff (doing the editing,
working with the composer on music, others on sound, more CGI, other stuff),
dealing with the mountain of licensing approvals that has piled up on my desk
due to being more interested in the show than that stuff, and (one hopes)
shortly gearing up for Crusade.

Also just had a new 4-hour miniseries that I wrote optioned by a major company.

Other than that, not much going on.
