&gt;- My husband wants to know if there are really 10 Zathrai, or whether it is
&gt;just one that has been time travelling *way* too much.

Yes, there are ten Zathri...despite the restraining order.

&gt;- I was wondering if you could explain a bit more about how you manage to do
&gt;things like bring in new major characters. You have said that you know what
&gt;threads need to be continued somehow, so I imagine you start with that.
&gt;What
&gt;needs to be accomplished and can any of the regulars take that over? If not,
&gt;I
&gt;picture in my mind your going to the B5 universe and saying " I need someone
&gt;who can, for example, run the station, keep the major characters on their
&gt;toes
&gt;and handle emergencies with minimal violence - who do we have that can handle
&gt;it?" Then a few people show up and you pick the one that suits your needs
&gt;best.

That comes pretty close...it's a matter of looking at the logistics and
backgrounds of people and, if a thread has to be adjusted ("What do you MEAN
Wayne Alexander just got hit by an asteroid?!) you look at the next logical
person in the show whom you can then beat up even further.  

It's not quite "one of you step forward," but it's close.

And sometimes it's a situation where you know that actor X hasn't had as much
to do as might've been the case, and an opening in thread A lets you do more
with that person.
