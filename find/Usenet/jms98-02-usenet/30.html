12 Feb 1998<PRE>Spoilers for A View from the Gallery

























&gt;In one scene Byron and friends combine to turn away an
&gt;invading soldier, but in another scene Byron alone places images into the
&gt;mind of the maintenance worker, Bo. Why did Byron need help with the
&gt;soldier but not with Bo? 

Because there's a substantial difference in will and intent in making a person
who's come to murder you turn around, and creating a momentary illusion in
someone's head.  It's the degree of effort involved.
