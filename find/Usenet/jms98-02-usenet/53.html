<H2>Re: attn. jms: one pass viewing or 2 pass?</H2>
25 Feb 1998<PRE>&gt;When you write the episodes with foreshadowing and other such puzzle
&gt;pieces to be clarified later, do you do so with the intent of the viewer
&gt;watching reruns of old episodes on a second pass and seeing how all the
&gt;pieces fit together, or do you write with the intent of the first
&gt;viewing pass, with the foreshadowing  having more of a subliminal effect
&gt;preparing for the further denouement? You couldn't have known that TNT
&gt;was going to pick up the show and run all the back episodes could you? 
&gt;
&gt;
Whether it was TNT or someone else, it was inevitable that someone would pick
up the reruns of the show; so I put stuff in to work both ways, as
foreshadowing, and things you could pick up on later, on re-viewing, that
suddenly jump out at you.
