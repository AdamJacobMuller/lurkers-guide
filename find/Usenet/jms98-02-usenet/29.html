&gt;Vocabulary lesson, please.
&gt;"Optioned" means that a major company can make the miniseries, but doesn't
&gt;have to, correct?

An option is the standard protocol in deal making.  It is a fee paid to the
writer allowing the studio or network to hold onto the material while it puts
together the rest of the deal.  Consider it a downpayment.  Once the deal is in
place, the rest of the money follows.
