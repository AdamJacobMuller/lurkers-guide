What the experiment also does, which you touch on, is to show how changing an
angle on an actor, making it a close-up rather than a long shot, can make the
scene more or less dynamic...how you can get out of scenes earlier than in the
first version, and thus pick up the pace.  

It is, as you say, most educational.
