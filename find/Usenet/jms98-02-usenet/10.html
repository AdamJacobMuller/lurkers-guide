<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: cats, CTS and clubs</H2>
3 Feb 1998<PRE>&gt;Cats- I've always assumed that you don't like felines but a recent posting 
&gt;made me wonder if maybe you do.  So.... do you like cats?

Absolutely.  But with all cats, it's half affection, half psychological
warfare.  Goes with the turf.

&gt;CTS - are you still suffering? 

It comes and goes.

&gt;Clubs - can members of the UK fan club access "thestation" site?

If by that you mean members in the UK of the B5 official fan club, then yes;
but membership in the UK fan club (a separate organization) is not membership
in the official organization.  But of course anyone can access thestation.com,
it's just that fans get certain areas and discounts others don't.
