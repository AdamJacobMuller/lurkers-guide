14 Feb 1998<PRE>Scoggins did exactly what you suggest, Diane.  She figured, "This isn't about
hair."  She was awakened, and had to get to C&amp;C fast, she ain't gonna do her
hair, just ponytail it back.

She didn't realize, in making that choice, that it would make her a) look that
severe in the uniform, since she was still getting used to it, and b) give her
the Ivanova "peanut-head" as she used to call it.  She later realized this was
a bit of an error, and has never done it since.
