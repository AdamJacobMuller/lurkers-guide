Thanks...Seven Days in May is an excellent movie, one of several that, if I'm
channel-surfing and come across, I can't *not* watch it.  They did a more
recent version of it for cable -- HBO, I think -- but the original will always
be my favorite.  

And yeah, Rod had an amazing way with words...still holds me in awe.

BTW, if you liked that one, I commend Fail Safe to you as well as The
Manchurian Candidate.
