<H2>Re: To jms: Babylon 5 and other science fiction shows</H2>
17 Feb 1998<PRE>&gt;You have mentioned on many occasions
&gt;that one of the things you wanted to do with this show was deviate from
&gt;more "traditional" American science fiction, such as Star Trek. Do you 
&gt;actually not like these shows, or did you just want to make
&gt;something different? 

It's the latter.  To do something differently isn't to say that it wasn't done
right before.  It's not a good/bad issue.  I wanted to do something that
nobody'd done before, in part BECAUSE nobody'd ever done it before...where's
the challenge otherwise?
