<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Resolution</H2>
3 Feb 1998<PRE>&gt;Now that you are in the process of writing the final script, I'd just
&gt;like to ask has the season shaped up the way you wanted it? And will 522
&gt;provide the same sense of resolution that 421 did?

Yes and no...the last part of the season is very tight, 17-19 are very much of
a piece, 20 sets up one final thread, then 21 and 22 are more designed to *lead
up to* the held-over 422.  That's one of the main differences...if it'd aired
at the end of S4, it would've been a bit of a jump, but now can lead up to it
more smoothly.
