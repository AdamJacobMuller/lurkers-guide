<H2>Re: ATTN: JMS</H2>
9 Feb 1998<PRE>&gt;-In season 2, we had all these cool 'exterior' kind of shots into
&gt;Sheridan's Office and Earhart's.  (Ex: the shot of Londo at the window
&gt;of Sheridan's office in "Geo. of Shadows")  What ever happened to them?
&gt;
&gt;

Bottom line...I keep forgetting to write them in.

&gt;-I'm a columbia house guy, collecting all the tapes -I wonder what
&gt;versions of the shows you are using.  For instance, in the US, we lost
&gt;the "Whole Garden Maze" in the ep with Londo and Morden in the Garden.
&gt;Are we gonna get the complete UK version or the US version?

The US version was only for the first airing; all subsequent airings have been
correct, and should be correct here (they told us they burned the incorrect
master...we'll see).
