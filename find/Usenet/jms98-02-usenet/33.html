<H2>Re: A View from the Gallery</H2>
14 Feb 1998<PRE>&gt;Remember, with the gravity produced by the station's
&gt;rotation, portholes must be in the floor.  Hence, in _The Long Dark_,
&gt;Schultz's character appeared to be looking through a floor drain.  For
&gt;Bo and Mack to have looked out the porthole in the lower wall, they must
&gt;have been walking down a rather steep incline.

Nope.

Look carefully at the station.  It is in segments; and at the outer wall of
each of those segments, as with the sanctuary, you can get an outer view.  You
can see the lights from some of these areas that have portholes in the station
when it's dark.
