&gt; please
&gt;please please don't throw in a typical jelousy-based story line with the
&gt;little woman mad about a prior relationship. Geeeez. 

It's amazing to see how many people (not speaking directly to you, but the
flood of email and public posts on this) who go right for cliche in how
something like this would be handled, and then have jumped to the conclusion
that that's what would be done *here*.

Believe me, that aspect ain't what this thread is about.
