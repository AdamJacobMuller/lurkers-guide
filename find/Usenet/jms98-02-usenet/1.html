2 Feb 1998<PRE>&gt;You have come so far in the last five years.
&gt;
I do hope so...we've learned a lot doing B5 over the years, and this kind of
intense writing tends to teach you a LOT in a very short amount of time.

&gt;And what's really amazing is I'm pretty sure you're going to top it at 
&gt;some point this year!

Hope so again...that's the other part.  I think we all have to keep challenging
ourselves on a daily basis, or what's the point of going on?
