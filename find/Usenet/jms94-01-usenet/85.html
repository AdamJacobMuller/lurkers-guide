<H2>Fighters</H2>
23 Jan 1994<PRE>     There are other kinds of fighters; it's a question of what's intended
for use where.  The Raider ships, and the Narn heavy fighters, are both
atmospheric and non-atmospheric ships.  Some fighters, such as B5's
Starfuries, the Drazi Sunhawk, the Ipsha Battleglobe and others (you'll
see the latter two in "Deathwalker") are configured only for non-atmosphere
activities, and have different configurations.
