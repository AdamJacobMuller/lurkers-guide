<H2>Re: Midnight: thoughts... AND</H2>
25 Jan 1994<PRE>     Quick responses: Re the spotlights, we'd figured that since the
transport had been freshly attacked, there'd be debris all over the
place, and lots of particulate matter which would show up in the light.
Re: the council...I tend to agree.  The prosthetics on our background
aliens and the League started out okay, but we felt we could do better,
and began a series of improvements, which can be seen most clearly in
"Deathwalker," where they're all proper prosthetics rather than masks.
