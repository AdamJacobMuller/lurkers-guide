<H2>Too many cooks...</H2>
16 Jan 1994<PRE>     What you are noticing is the same thing suffered by anyone who creates
something; for a long time, it's just yours, and maybe a few others' as
well.  But the point is to get it *out there*.  And when that happens, as
with creating B5, it isn't *yours* any longer, it belongs to the viewers.
It can take some getting used to, and you just have to learn to let go.
