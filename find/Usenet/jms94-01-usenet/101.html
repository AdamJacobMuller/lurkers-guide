<H2>Re: ALIEN DESIGN CONCEPTS</H2>
24 Jan 1994<PRE>     Okay, but now, the only problem is...let's say we take your advice,
and build an alien around the design of an oyster.  Now we have Sinclair
having a converstion with an oyster.  Can you *imagine* the audience
reaction?  Some things sound nice in theory, but when you build it, and
try to play it for drama...it ends up very, very badly.
