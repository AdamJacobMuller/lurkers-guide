<H2>B5: Universe Today Babylon 5 E</H2>
23 Jan 1994<PRE>     Just a minor correctin: B5 did not miss even *one* day of filming
due to the quake.  We gave everyone the option of staying home, but they
wanted to come in...so we were shooting first thing Tuesday morning
(Monday, remember, was a holiday).
