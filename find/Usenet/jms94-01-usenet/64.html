<H2>What I didn't like (minor Midn</H2>
18 Jan 1994<PRE>     A few small quibbles with your quibbles:
 
     1) In "Midnight," Sinclair is really not given a chance to show his
character, since it's basically a reintroduction to the series, and there
is a lot to cover.  He functions throughout the episode only in his
official capacity.  In other episodes, you'll get to see some very
different sides to his character, particular in "Parliament of Dreams."
 
     2) The line, "You're too young to hurt that much," which actually
is, "You're too young to experience that much pain," isn't from
"Midnight."  It's from "Infection."
 
     3) I agree, most of the plot lines are tied up pretty well (except
for the telepath issue introduced at the end, which comes back at us
again...as does, incidentally, the Raghesh 3 incident and other stuff).
In responding to some of the criticism of the pilot, I tried to make this
one far more self-contained.  Which is why I much prefer "Parliament,"
"Mind War" and "Soul Hunter" over "Midnight."
 
     4) Yes, Vir is very obsequious in "Midnight."  That's done in order
to give his character somewhere to go, as gradually he begins to stand up
to Londo and talk back.
