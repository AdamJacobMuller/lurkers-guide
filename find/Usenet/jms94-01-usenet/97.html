<H2>Budget Cuts Too Obvious ...</H2>
24 Jan 1994<PRE>     I really don't know what you mean by budget cuts affecting the
points you mention.  If we'd wanted to save money, we would've left the
prosthetics and other design elements the same as in the pilot.  But
after doing the pilot, we looked at the makeup designs for Delenn and
G'Kar and decided we didn't much like the way they came out, and set out
-- at considerable cost -- to redo them.  We did new life-casts, hired
new people to re-sculpt the alien headpieces, and went to a somewhat
more expensive variety of Delenn's headpiece.  As for G'Kar's makeup
being a bit "thinner," that's because we went to a finer mask, which
tears more easily, has to be replaced more often, at greater cost...but
which gives the actor a LOT more freedom of expression.  To make a thick
mask is a LOT less expensive than a thin one.
 
     We changed things, yes...but out of personal preference.  Same with
the observation dome, where we added an office for Sinclair, did the
same with medlab for Franklin...you may or may not agree with a change,
but please don't assume automatically that budget was involved when in fact
it was not.
