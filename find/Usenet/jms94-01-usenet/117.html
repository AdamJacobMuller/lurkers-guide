<H2>Reaction of the Council. Spoil</H2>
30 Jan 1994<PRE>     It's interesting what we can read into faces...in Delenn's reaction,
I saw concern, angst, but not that she believed the story.  That certainly
wasn't the intent of the scene, or the script...faces are interesting
things.  As for the rest, you're right; not everyone wants to do the Right
Thing For The Right Reasons.  Some would prefer not to get involved.  So
some might want deniability, want a reason not to go up against the
Narns, or have sold out their votes.  A human looking at that screen
could tell that the person was being coerced...but what about the other
alien races, to whom a downcast face could be a sign of joy?  In any
event, suspicion is one thing, but *proof* is another, and the legal
system works on *proof*.  Nothing could be done until they had the proof
that Sinclair got at the end, and chose to use behind closed doors to
the same effect.
