<H2>Yo Joe! Some Questions...</H2>
11 Jan 1994<PRE>     On the theory that some of the militaries have blended, the system of
ranks is kind of a cross between the navy and the air force (at least the
ones with which our characters will have any interaction).  Probably an
admiral would be more likely to run this place.
 
     At some point, we'll probably see what it looks like from the ship'
 POV leaving or entering hyperspace, yes.
