11 Jan 1994<PRE>     As a matter of fact, in a couple of episodes you'll see a photo of
the Earth Alliance president.  The photo itself is of Doug Netter, my
associate on the show and fellow executive producer.  (The woman running
against the incumbent president in the election featured on "Midnight" is
played, in photo, by our wardrobe designer, Ann Bruice.)
