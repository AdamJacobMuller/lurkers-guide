<H2>ID of someone in Making of...</H2>
23 Jan 1994<PRE>     The fellow to whom you refer is John Copeland, one of our producers
on B5.  We've got a John Copeland, a John Iacovelli, a John Johnston, a
John Radulovic...we've got Johns all over the place on this show, oddly
enough.  (Though you can never have enough johns, I suppose....)  And just
as oddly, only one Joe.  Go figure.
