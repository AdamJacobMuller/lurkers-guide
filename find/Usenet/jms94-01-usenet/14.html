6 Jan 1994<PRE>     No, we generally don't announce the day/month in the episodes, though
sometimes dates or seasons are referred to tangentially or offhandedly.
The real significant progression is year to year, which is why each year
of the show will be marked in the opening narration and parallel real
time (season 1: 2258, season 2: 2259, etc.).
