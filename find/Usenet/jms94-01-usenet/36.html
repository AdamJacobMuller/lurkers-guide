11 Jan 1994<PRE>     Oh, absolutely; I'd say that "Parliament," "Mind War," "Soul" and
"Purple" are (to my mind at least) much better than "Midnight."  Mind,
that's just my personal preference, your mileage may vary.
 
     But I'd say that our two *best* so far are still "And the Sky Full of
Stars" and "Chrysalis."  I just watched a cut of "Chrysalis" today which
finally had all the CGI in it, and had to scrape my brain off the opposing
wall, it's *that* good.
