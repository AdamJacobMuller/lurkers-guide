<H2>Re: Psis and Trials</H2>
18 Jan 1994<PRE>     I'm sorry, but whether or not you personally agree with the
structure, the prohibition on the use of telepaths in court is NOT
irrational, OR based on an irrational government.  Members of the Psi
Corps are NOT just individuals walking around; they are *governmentally
regulated and controlled*.  Any good defense or prosecution attorney
could turn that against them.  Also, the Law Profession isn't ABOUT to
turn over control of its actions to a bunch of government-regulated
telepaths.
 
     There are already restrictions in place on hearsay evidence, even on
anecdotal or eyewitness testimony.  People are entitled to a fair trial,
and due process, *based on evidence*, not the opinions of a State
employee or someone controlled by the State.  This has been the history
(at least in theory) of jurisprudence in this country for the last 200
years.
 
     Finally, the judicial arm of the government itself will not relinquish
control over the courts to an outside agency.  Look at human nature; this
simply will NOT happen.  It is not irrational, it is relentlessly
logical, and based upon what happens now in our court system, and what is
likely in the event of actual telepaths being discovered.  And again, you
have to remember that there are competing governmental agencies involved
here, this isn't just a bunch of civilian witnesses roaming around.
 
     And on another level, there are LOTS of reasons for wanting the Psi
Corps NOT to get this kind of control or influence.  Some might say (and
in the course of this series, some WILL say) that the Psi Corps have too
much influence as it is, they're trying to worm their way in all over
the place.  They represent the all-seeing Big Brother, with the potential
for massive abuse.
