<H2>Re: B5 and Trek</H2>
19 Jan 1994<PRE>     Actually, if you want to verify which came first, there's a very
simple and easy way to do it that doesn't require taking my word for it.
1) There's an interview with me in Starlog during the time I was story
editor on the new Twilight Zone series.  I mention there about having
been trying to sell a show called Babylon 5 for some time.  Also, I
slipped a reference to B5 into my second novel, "OtherSyde," published
around 1991 in hardcover by Dutton.
