<H2>Re: alt.Babylon-5.creative</H2>
23 Jan 1994<PRE>     There's a general difference between "it'd be nice to see Garibaldi
in civvies" as a discussion of things people would like to see in a show,
and, "okay, Garibaldi is stranded on a planet with a talking moose who
proceeds to sing show-tunes all night."  The latter is a *story*, and
that is the thing I have to be careful not to stumble across.
