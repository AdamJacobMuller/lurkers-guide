<H2>Re: Earth Shake!</H2>
21 Jan 1994<PRE>     The worst part of the quake, really, was that my house was without
electricity until Midnight Thursday night.  So I'd write (up against a
real deadline because of the quake) at the office, charge up my notebook
computer, go home, fire up the notebook, and write scripts by flashlight.
 
     Yikes.
