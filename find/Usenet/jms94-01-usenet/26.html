<H2>Re: jms's creds</H2>
8 Jan 1994<PRE>     My software is not easily set up to let me quote from stuff.  I get
a list of messages...anywhere up to 50-55 at a time.  I read in batches,
and when I see something requiring a response, the GEnie software is set
up so that I type REP 25 (for message 25) and begin typing.  My personal
software isn't set up to quote stuff; I'd have to re-list the message,
capture it, edit it, all by hand...it becomes a major pain in the ass, adn
(and) would increase several-fold the amount of work involved.  Meaning
that I would have less time to respond, and thus could respond to fewer
messages.  In general, I try to paraphrase or restate or clarify the
original question in my reply, and usually I think it's clear enough.
 
     But I'll work harder to be clear.
