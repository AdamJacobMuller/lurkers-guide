<H2>Spoiler Question (minor spoile</H2>
12 Jan 1994<PRE>     I have nothing to do with the description applied to the show by
others.  In that episode, the affected person isn't "turned into" a
machine.  It is sort of a living armor-like compound that grows over the
person's body, and begins to influence the person in question.  That is
the sum and substance of it; he isn't transmuted, his biology isn't
changed, his brain isn't replaced, and so on.
 
     My suggestion: judge the episode based on the episode, not on what
choice of words someone else used in trying to synopsize the episode.
Because Moby Dick can be summed up as, "A nut chasing a big fish."  But
there's obviously more to the story than that, and it's not entirely
accurate.
