2 Jan 1994<PRE>     The computerized cut of the pilot is now dumped out of memory, and
those portions only exist on a few VHS tapes of marginal quality.  Also,
the footage in computer file form is *very* low grade, like a poorly
scanned gif file, very low resolution.  It would be useless on a laser
disk.
