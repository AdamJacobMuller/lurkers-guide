18 Jan 1994<PRE>     A telepath is allowed to function neither way, to scan someone to
determine he's innocent, or to act as accuser.  You mention the pilot,
but *in* the pilot, Lyta didn't scan Sinclair.  She scanned a *victim*
of a potential crime.  She was not asked to go in and look for the
killer, she was asked to find out how the poison got into Kosh's
system.  A telepath can do this.  (A telepath can, on some situations,
also scan a victim unable to testify for physical reasons to find out
who did the act, as I said before, **BUT** that must still be backed up
with physical evidence, you can't just take the telepath's word for it,
there MUST be physical evidence.)
 
     All of which is why, in the pilot, it was *also* stipulated that
the information gained was "inadmissible" (in Kyle's testimony).
 
     There are a lot of reasons why this has been worked out to within an
inch of its life, none of which I can comment on yet.  (The other aspect
of all this that has to be borne in mind is that a LOT of people, many of
them important, do NOT like the Psi Corps, don't *trust* the Psi Corps,
and are actively against them extending their power.
