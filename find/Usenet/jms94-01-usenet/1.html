<H2>B-5 pilot: "The Director's Cut</H2>
2 Jan 1994<PRE>     The odds are zero, since the first version of the B5 pilot existed
only as a computer-graphic file edited movie.  It wasn't edited on film,
for real, until we'd pared it down.  We'd have to go in and totally
re-edit and re-score, and I doubt that's going to happen.
