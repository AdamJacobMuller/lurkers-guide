<H2>Heraldry in Star Fury Markings</H2>
20 Jan 1994<PRE>     There are a number of influences that go into the markings on the
Starfuries.  (And not all 'furies are so marked; only those that are
generally used by only one pilot, to whom the ship is assigned.)  We
took in general the WW II model, where pilots used to decorate their
craft with nose art to personalize it.  So some of it is of that flavor,
while others echo more ancient heraldry.  (Ivanova's 'fury has an old
Russian two-headed eagle in stylized form.)  Yes, again, an attempt to
connect past, present and future.
