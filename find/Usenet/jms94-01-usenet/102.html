<H2>Midnight: thoughts...</H2>
25 Jan 1994<PRE>     Just a note...re: the CGI looking crisp and unblurred...the blurring
you're used to seeing is an artifact of atmosphere.  There is no air in
space, and thus no blurring.  (Check the latest NASA footage for more on
this.)  That's of course why they put Hubble in space, to avoid the
problems of blurring caused by atmosphere.
 
     We probably could've put in atmospheric blurring to give it a
different depth-of-field, but we have this bugaboo about being a
-science- fiction show....
