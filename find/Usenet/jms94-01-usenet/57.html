<H2>Late B5?</H2>
16 Jan 1994<PRE>     No, the show isn't a year and a half late.  As it is, it's less than
one year since the pilot aired.  It was our initial hope, and my initial
belief, that we'd go straight into the series as soon as we finished the
pilot.  But the studio, in its infinite wisdom, decided that since they
HAD a pilot, it kinda behooved them to air it and get the ratings before
committing to a series.  So we then waited until February for the airing,
got the go-ahead to production around April/May, began shooting in July,
got a whole bunch of episodes in the can, and now we're hitting the air.
That is the sum and substance of it.
