<H2>Skeptical about B5</H2>
12 Jan 1994<PRE>     There's nothing wrong with skepticism about the show.  I've said,
from the start, judge us on what you see, not what I say.
 
     Will you be disappointed?  That's not for me to say.  Inevitably,
some people will be because *no* show can be the show you see in your
head, the one you'd make if it were your show.  The problem with a show
like this is that everyone begins to attach their dissatisfaction from
other shows to it, and saying, "Well, THIS one will be my perfect vision
of an SF series."  And it won't be.  It's my vision of what an SF series
should be.  Some folks will feel the same way, some won't.  NYPD Blue is
a very popular show.  Many people like it.  I can't get into it.  Tastes
vary.
 
     Will the show be well-produced?  Well acted?  Well written?  Well
directed?  Will the EFX be what they should be: imaginative and rich
and textured?  Yes.  These things I can promise.  Will the final result
ring your particular chime?  That we'll have to see.  I can say that all
the pieces are there.
 
     Re: the commercials...the pacing of the commercials has nothing to do
with the pacing of the show.  The show is the show, a commercial is a
commercial.  They serve different masters and different needs.
 
     No, not everything will be solved with a gun.  Sometimes, though, a
gun is necessary as part of a solution to a problem.  Other times, it
isn't.  And sometimes, the problem really isn't solved; sometimes our
characters fail.  Sometimes things don't work out for the best at the end
of the show.  Because life's like that.
 
     One other thing that I can guarantee you is that our characters aren't
stupid, they don't do things for dumb reasons.  Sometimes, in shows, it
seems they make their characters momentarily stupid because that's the
only way to get them into trouble.  We try to be smarter than that.  Our
characters are as sharp as they come...which makes it more interesting
when they get into trouble.  Sometimes being sharp isn't enough.
 
     No two episodes are really alike.  "Midnight," aside from the task
of re-introducing the characters, is something of an action piece, a
run-and-jump.  "Soul" is a much smaller, more personal story, more
character based.  "Purple" is funny, and sad, with a fair amount of action.
 "Infection" is a heavy-duty action piece for the most part.  "Parliament"
is a character piece with a very little action, but lots of fun.  "Mind
War" has a hell of a lot of action, but also a mystery element to it as
well.  Not a lot of humor in that one.
 
     I think people will like the show.  I think they'll like the
characters a lot.  But obviously I'm biased.
