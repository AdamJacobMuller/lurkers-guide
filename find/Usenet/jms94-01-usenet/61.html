<H2>Earth Shake!</H2>
18 Jan 1994<PRE>     Came through pretty much okay, all considered.  At the house, the
living room fireplace is now IN the living room (on the floor), the patio
has separated from the rest of the house, there's major cracks all over
the place, everything that was on shelves is now on the floor...but the
stage came through okay, and we're back to shooting today, if possibly
on a reduced schedule.  (Everyone was given the option of not coming in
today, but everyone wanted to show support, get back on the horse
again, and get going.  Some even came in on their own time Monday to help
with cleanup.)
 
     Onward.
