2 Jan 1994<PRE>     RE: the newspaper...Stephen Furst's contract brings him up to 22
episodes in year 3 and doesn't mention anything beyond that only because
there are no further increases in episodes; our seasons run 22 episodes.
The plan is to have his character present throughout the full 5 year run.
As for the review...I have a sneaking suspicion that he's talking about
the pilot, since the cassette tapes of the first episode only went out
on Friday.
