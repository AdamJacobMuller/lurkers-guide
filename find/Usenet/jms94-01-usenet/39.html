<H2>A word about B5 in the press..</H2>
11 Jan 1994<PRE>     Part of the problem is that many reporters have come to expect, and
come to associate that SF-shows = crap.  Or kid's stuff.  They've gotten
very jaded with the same old promises every year.  So on that level, it's
understandable.  There are areas where it's *not* understandable or
defensible, but I'll leave that topic for another time....
