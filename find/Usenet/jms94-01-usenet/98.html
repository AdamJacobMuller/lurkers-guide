<H2>Re: CRITICAL COMMENTS: "Midnig</H2>
24 Jan 1994<PRE>     You're correct in your appraisal of the "coincidences" in the
first episode.  Upon finding that Londo's nephew was there, they would
of course trot him out to try and undermine Londo's credibility (you'll
note that G'Kar made special mention of this, as if to say, "Is the
Centauri ambassador calling his own nephew a liar?").  It'd be the same
thing if the son of an American ambassador was on-hand when hostages
were taken.
 
     As for the choice of the attack's location...Londo wanted his nephew
"far away from all this."  Someplace safe.  A fairly safe, mundane place
is not going to have a major military presence...and hence is a perfect
target for attack.
 
                                                                   jms
