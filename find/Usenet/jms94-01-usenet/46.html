<H2>Harlan Ellison &amp; Babylon 5</H2>
13 Jan 1994<PRE>     The SF writing material I can't comment on just now, for a number of
reasons.  Regarding any outside commentary...Harlan has commented on the
show in his Sci-Fi Channel commentaries, and will do so in future.  He's
also given several interviews about the show.
