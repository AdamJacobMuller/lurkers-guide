<H2>jms's creds</H2>
4 Jan 1994<PRE>     Yikes; that's an awful lot of ground to cover.  I've worked as story
editor or producer on such series as the new Twilight Zone, Murder She
Wrote, and the live-action SF series Captain Power (seen by maybe ten
people in the country before it was yanked off the air for being "the most
violent show on television," a post now occupied by Brisco County Jr., we
are told by congress).  I've written something on the order of 120-130
produced episodes of television, and story edited probably twice that.  (I
began in animation, story editing shows such as the Real Ghostbusters, the
syndicated and first network season, before walking off the show when they
compromised Janine's character.)  I've been nominated for Gemini, Writers
Guild, Bram Stoker and Ace Awards.  Two nominations were for the
adaptation I did for Showtime's Nightmare Classics series, "The Strange
Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde," with Anthony Andrews and Laura Dern.
 I was on Murder for about two years before leaving to do B5.
 
     I've written produced radio dramas (including for Mutual Radio
Theater and Alien Worlds), published dark fantasy novels (hardcover from
Dutton, Demon Night and OtherSyde), produced stage plays, and something
on the order of 500 published articles.  Started out as a reporter and
ended up working for the L.A. Times, TIME Inc., and others.  Anyway,
that's a quick overview of it.  (And no, no show in the 70s; my TV credits
begin around 1984.)
