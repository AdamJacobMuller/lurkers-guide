<H2>Expanded seasons?</H2>
12 Jan 1994<PRE>     At this point, it's way too early to even *think* about topics like
expanded seasons.  Obviously, yes, we could easily expand each season's
worth of episodes from a story point of view.  That ain't no kind of
problem.  As for the rest...only time will tell.
