<H2>ALIEN DESIGN CONCEPTS</H2>
23 Jan 1994<PRE>      We're taking the position that some things might look similar to
Earth life, but others won't.  n'grath has a fairly traditional insectoid
look, but that is so pervasive here that it's a good chance it'll work
out there.  On the other hand, the pak'ma'ra, which you'll get a good look
at in "Legacies," are *quite* different from earth critters.  The basic
problem, of course, is that all we have as a frame of reference, in
reality, is Earth stuff; we haven't yet seen real alien life.  So
anything we come up with is in some way, however distorted, based on what
we can conceive of.  This is limited by experience.  This is the problem
on ANY level in dealing with aliens.  Whatever we conceive will never be
a fraction of what the reality would be.
