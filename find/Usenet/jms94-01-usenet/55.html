<H2>Re: Psis and Trials [was Re: B</H2>
16 Jan 1994<PRE>     Exactly.  The inadmissibility of telepathic scans of the accused,
and even the *prohibition* against same, is the reason Sinclair wasn't
and couldn't be scanned by Lyta in the pilot.  I could've explained this
in some detail, but the pilot was already *so* exposition heavy that I
figured it'd be better to wait until (I thought at the time) the next
few episodes, which would get into that.  (That was when I figured we'd be
going straight to series.)
 
     Another example of what was assumed to be a lapse in story logic, but
which was actually a plot point....
