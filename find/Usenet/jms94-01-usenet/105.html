<H2>Re: Budget Cuts Too Obvious ..</H2>
25 Jan 1994<PRE>     Your tastes are your tastes.  You don't like something, fine, but
that doesn't make it "dreck."  I like Delenn's makeup a LOT more now than
in the pilot.  To me, it looks a lot more like what a Minbari SHOULD look
like (and as it happens, there's only one person who can make that
particular call).  I'm sorry you don't like it.  But dreck it ain't.  I
think it's *very* elegant.  Tastes differ.
