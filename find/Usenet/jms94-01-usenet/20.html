6 Jan 1994<PRE>     You're correct, particularly with reference to "Infection."  That
episode has a lot of action, which you'd expect, and a big conclusion,
which you'd expect.  What you *won't* expect, I think, is what happens
afterward, in a conversation no one generally has in TV after big action
stuff has gone down.  And it's something to chew on, I think....
