<H2>B5: "Midnight on the Firing Li</H2>
28 Jan 1994<PRE>     Just two quickies: 1) you *did* see somebody pay for a drink; in
the bar at the end, Ivanova clicks her drink with her credit chit, which
is used to pay for stuff (you'll see them used in more detail down the
road).  2) you mention that Londo had evidence he didn't use...what was
that?  Not the recorder, because by this time the Narna have admitted
that they used force, but have couched it in the terms that they were
invited in (the way the Germans were supposedly "invited" into some of
the countries they invaded).
