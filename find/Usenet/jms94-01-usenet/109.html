<H2>Re: B5 review in Cleveland Pla</H2>
27 Jan 1994<PRE>     The problem, of course, is that any space-oriented SF series is
going to be compared against Trek...which has 25 years of shared history
behind it.  One episode, or even two of a new series simply cannot
compete with 25 years.  Some critics observed that after seeing the B5
pilot, they don't know as much about our characters as they know about
Spock and Kirk.  Well, no...come back in 25 years and then we'll talk.
 
     If you spend the time to do lots of character stuff, you get gigged
for being slow and plodding (as happened in the pilot); if you go for a
story with more action, they gig you for putting action above
characterization.  This first episode has received *both* complaints; some
said it was all action, some said there was no action.
 
     You can get dizzy after a while....
