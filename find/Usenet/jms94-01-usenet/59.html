<H2>To JMS Regarding B5 electronic</H2>
16 Jan 1994<PRE>     Let me make it clear: I have nothing to do with the manufacture of
the electronic press kit, or the platforms selected.  What I can say is
that Warners distribution is not in the computer business (at least, not
as of this moment).  They have a limited budget.  In testimony to the
great commitment on-line for the show, they put together this EPK, and
could afford to pick two formats in which it could be made.  They settled
on MAC and IBM because those two are the dominant formats numerically,
whatever the benefits, values and positives associated with the Amiga.
 
     It was something never in the original plans, is done as a compliment
to BBSers, is the first time ANY TV series has done this at *all*, and
it has been met by some hostility from Amiga users because that platform
wasn't included.  Yes, Amiga has provided Foundation (which we don't own)
with some nifty tools.  And those tools have received, and will continue
to receive *substantial* publicity through B5.  Millions more people will
be reached concerning what the Amiga (and Toaster) can do because of this
show.  So on that level, I consider the scales balanced.
 
     As far as an Amiga version...Jim Moloshok, head of marketing for
Warners, has given permission to a couple of people to hack the program
into an Amiga format.  This is because whatever you might think, studios
do not have infinite amounts of time or money.  I imagine that version
will be out sooner or later.  We all do what we can.
