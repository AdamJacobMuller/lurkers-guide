16 Jan 1994<PRE>     Regarding the ads...when you have 14-16 regular and recurring
characters, you have to determine which of them will end up in an ad,
because anyone not included is bound to be offended unless you come up
with some unbiased way of selecting them.  What was finally chosen was
the number of episodes in which they appear.  The cut-off point was 13
episodes.  At that point and above, you have Sinclair, Delenn, Garibaldi,
Ivanova, G'Kar, Londo.  Below that you have Franklin, Lennier, Vir, Talia,
Na'Toth, etc.
