<H2>_Midnight..._ comments [Minor</H2>
27 Jan 1994<PRE>     That the Centauri *claimed* that we were a lost colony is not the
same as indicating that we *believed* them.
 
     As for the Narns...yes, they are portrayed in a favorable light in
many episodes, from "By Any Means" to "Chrysalis" and "Mind War," to name
but a few.  Nobody is just one thing on this show.  Not nobody, not
nohow.
