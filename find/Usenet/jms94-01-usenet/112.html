<H2>Questions for JMS (some spoile</H2>
28 Jan 1994<PRE>     Quick replies to your questions: Spoo is.  What else can one say
about spoo?
 
     Those running B5 are a branch of what was/will be Earthforce Air
Force/Air Command.  To reach a certain command level requires piloting
experience, preferably under combat situations.
 
     That was a Centauri weapon.
 
     The scanners on the Starfuries detected no movement, no atmosphere,
no signals, no warmth of bodies.
 
     The Centauri station actually was rotating, as I recall, it's the
camera angle that I believe doesn't showcase it as well as it might.
 
     The lights on the fighters during the examination of the rubble
were visible due to particulate matter spewed out during and after the
attack.
