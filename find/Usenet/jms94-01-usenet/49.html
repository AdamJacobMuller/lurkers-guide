<H2>Psis and Trials [was Re: B5 Te</H2>
14 Jan 1994<PRE>     No, the accused cannot ask for a psi to validate his or her
innocence; the trial can ONLY proceed on the basis of evidence.  This is to
prevent abuse, trials where a Psi looks at you and determines your guilt.
When a life is at stake, you can't risk the possibility of some hidden
agenda on the part of the telepath.  You'd have to use a telepath to
verify the first telepath's scan, and on and on.  Best simply to exclude
them from that aspect of the law.
