<H2>Re: B-5 pilot: "The Director's</H2>
3 Jan 1994<PRE>     I'm certainly not showing disdain for the missing material; I'm just
saying it ain't *there*.  Now, if B5 turns out to be a megahit, there may
be money set aside to re-edit the pilot some years down the road, but I'm
not currently counting on it.  My chief concern now has to be the series.
 
     As for keeping a record...I try, if spottily.  Oddly enough, the very
best record of this process exists in the multi-megabytes that have been
exchanged here, on GEnie and elsewhere.  It's something of a living
chronology.  I try to take photos on the set (when I remember), and I'm
keeping 1 copy of each day's dailies, instead of recycling the tapes.
