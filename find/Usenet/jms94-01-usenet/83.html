23 Jan 1994<PRE>     Yes, "Demon Night," published in hardcover by Dutton (and later
nominated for a Bram Stoker Award) was my first published novel.  My second
novel was "OtherSyde," also from Dutton.  Writing novels gave me the
foundation I needed to really outline and prepare B5 as a novel-for-TV.
