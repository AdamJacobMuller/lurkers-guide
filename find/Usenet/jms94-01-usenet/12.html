<H2>too violent.....</H2>
6 Jan 1994<PRE>     Oh, believe me, take it seriously they did.  Power was characterized
in the press by leading magazines as the most violent show on TV, there
were organized protests, I ended up in televised debates on this concerning
the show...and gradually the sponsor folded.  These things do happen....
