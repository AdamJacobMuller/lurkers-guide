<H2>B5 Tech Readout v.0.0 : The Qu</H2>
13 Jan 1994<PRE>     There's too much to cover in one message, so in brief:
 
     The station is a touch over 5 miles long.  It can hold roughly
250,000 humans and aliens (many of whom are in transit at any point).
The fighters are the SA-23E Mitchell-Hyundyne Starfuries, and B5 has
four fighter wings, each with approximately 12 fighters.
 
     The rings are classified, as is the encounter suit.  Psi Corps
ratings are assigned from within the Academy, based on test results and
personal interviews/training.  Restrictions: NO unauthorized scans
-- you need the permission of the person, tacit permission, or written
permission of next of kin -- and no "dipping," going into other areas
not relevant to the current scan.  In criminal cases, psi's may not
scan defendants during a trial or before to determine guilt or innocence,
as this violates the right of due process.  After a conviction, a psi
may be called upon to function in various capactities (which will be seen
in "The Quality of Mercy").  A psi *may* scan the victim of a crime unable
to remember details of an attack, but that information must be backed up
by physical evidence, or it is inadmissible.
