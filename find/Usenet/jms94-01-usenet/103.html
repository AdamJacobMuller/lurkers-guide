<H2>EVIL HUMANS? (will there be?)</H2>
25 Jan 1994<PRE>     There are *plenty* of humans in B5's universe who are on the dark
side of things, take my word for it.  I don't subscribe to the "we're nice
'cause we're humans" philosophy.  You'll see 'em all over the show as the
episodes pass.
 
     It seems to me that generally in such shows, all the interesting
things happen to aliens, are caused by aliens.  I like a show where you
have interesting things happen to interesting humans, good, bad and
indifferent.
