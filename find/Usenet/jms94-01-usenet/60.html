<H2>JMS... A question about tech</H2>
17 Jan 1994<PRE>     I believe that Ron is working to put together a possible B5 tech
manual sometime soonish.
 
     The history of Earth for about the last 100 years prior to the time
of B5 is broken out, and though it isn't laid out in detail in the
series, it forms a reference backdrop for us, so it's all consistent when
we refer to any part of it.  The pilot was 2257, the first year of the
series is 2258, year two would be 2259, and so on.  The story requires 5
years of story time as well as 5 years of real time to tell.  Things have
to go through some real time lapse for the story to work out properly.
Consequently, the narration at the top of the show ("...the year is 2258,
the name of the place is Babylon 5") will be changed each season.
