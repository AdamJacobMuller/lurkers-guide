<H2>Re: Attn JMS: Story Breaking?</H2>
19 Nov 1995<PRE>     What I do is this: I get a pad of legal-sized paper, and divide it
into six quadrants, all on the same page, standing for teaser, four acts
and tag.  I drop the beats of the story into the relevant places where I
think they'd logically fall (the big moments always go at act breaks).
This way I can see the entire flow of the story at one glance, which is
important for getting a feel for the episode.  If one act gets over
burdened, I just draw a line moving one beat to another act.


                                                                   jms
