<H2>ATTN JMS: Maybe setting recor</H2>
15 Nov 1995<PRE>      Actually, the point raised is a valid one; I'd omitted the British
shows because they tend to be more author driven in any event; McGoohan
probably wrote 90% of The Prisoner (under various names), and there have
been similar examples elsewhere.  I was mainly thinking of American TV.
