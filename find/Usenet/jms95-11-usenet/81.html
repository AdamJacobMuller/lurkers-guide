<H2>ATTN: JMS Thanks for Marcus' l</H2>
24 Nov 1995<PRE>     It's predictable that I'd put someone into the show with who's a guy
with thick, long hair...since every time I look in the mirror I realize
more and more that where I'm concerned, thick, long hair will always be
an unattainable, science fiction concept....
