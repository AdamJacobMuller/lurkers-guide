<H2>JMS: B5 merchandise</H2>
2 Nov 1995<PRE>     No, those all look licensed to me.  BTW, Creation Entertainment in
Glendale CA has these nifty B5 jackets and the best B5 mugs I've seen
yet; they're oversized black ceramic mugs with the B5 logo on one side,
and a silhouette of the station on the other side, both done in silver.
Really nifty.


     BTW #2: there are three patches that are starting to show up at
conventions: an Earthforce3t#@ppz1s Off-World, Death's Hands, and the Starfury
"Ugly But Well Hung" patch.  These are *strictly* illegal, and we're
backtracking this to the source.  If you see any of these, let me know
where and when and any info you can get on who was selling them and/or
their source.
