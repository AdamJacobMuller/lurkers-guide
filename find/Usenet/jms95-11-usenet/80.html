<H2>Joke Source(Convictions Spoile</H2>
22 Nov 1995<PRE>      I don't actually know for certain the origin of the joke; it was all
over the nets, and the BBSs, uploaded places with several gazillion other
lightbulb jokes (after I'd made the original version of this in the show),
which is why I figured I'd drop it into the episode, since it was so common
and associated with the nets.  While in the UK, I met a young man who said
that he had been the first with that variation, and I have no reason not
to believe him.  (A couple other people sent me email saying that they
had also come up with that one; it's kind of obvious I guess, but again,
I have no way of knowing what's true because it was just all over the
place, never with attribution.)
