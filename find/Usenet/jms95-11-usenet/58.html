19 Nov 1995<PRE>      Re: Minbari lying...it has been established, repeatedly, that the
Minbari do lie *when it means saving someone else's honor*.  That was
even stated, openly, in the very same episode about Sheridan's frame
job, "There All The Honor Lies."  Londo says, right there, that the
Minbari will lie for a greater cause, another's honor.  The same was done
in "The Quality of Mercy."  Delenn fibbed about the ship in "Matters"
because in so doing, she saved Sheridan's honor.


     This is not a plot hole, it's been established clearly in the series
on multiple occasions.  We have never, ever, at any time said conclusively
that Minbari never, ever lie.  This is another example of certain persons
simply not paying attention, and then blaming the show for their own lack
of continuity in attention.
