<H2>JMS: Budget breakdown?</H2>
19 Nov 1995<PRE>     I can't give you specifics, because that stuff is generally
considered private.  One thing I can say...there's what called "above
the line" and "below the line;" above the line includes the total
costs for cast, producers, writers, directors, and the like; below the
line is construction, art department, makeup, costume, and so on.


     On the average show, the above the line is as much as two thirds
of the total budget, in large measure because the producing staff is
large, and the producers take out huge budgets.  In the case of B5, the
above the line is less than *half* the total budget.  Every penny of
our budget is up there on the screen.


                                                                 jms
