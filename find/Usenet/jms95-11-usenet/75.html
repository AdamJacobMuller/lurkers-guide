<H2>ATTN JMS: What *would* you do</H2>
22 Nov 1995<PRE>     First thing I'd do is increase the fees paid to the cast and crew,
who deserve to share in what they've done.


     Then I'd allocate the rest to: expanding and improving our sets and
costumes; renting a secondary stage facility to give us more blue screen
potential, where can get further back from the subject and create better
looking composites...and build more standing sets rather than switching
sets in and out of the stage; I'd do more planetside stuff, and more CGI
in the course of a season.


     It wouldn't so much change the show as make us able to more fully
realize the story visually.


                                                                   jms
