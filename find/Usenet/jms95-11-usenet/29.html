<H2>MoH observation (SPOILER)</H2>
10 Nov 1995<PRE>     Yeah, we made some small modifications to the headpiece (good call,
Corun).  It merges more seamlessly behind, it's raised slightly at the
crest, and the ends blend more smoothly into the skin in front, to make
the whole thing more natural.


                                                                  jms
