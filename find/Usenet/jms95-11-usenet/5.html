<H2>ATTN JMS-B5 IS A RIP OFF OF JM</H2>
2 Nov 1995<PRE>     I deeply resent this implication.  I have never even been in the
same *room* as myself, have never allowed myself to have access to any of
my material, and the notion that I would stoop to using such second-rate
material is a simple affront.  If I find out that I've been spreading this
vicious rumor, be assured that I will track me down and beat me senseless
until it stops.










     I really need a break....
