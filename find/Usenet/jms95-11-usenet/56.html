<H2>Attn JMS: Don't tell me how to</H2>
16 Nov 1995<PRE>      You're confusing several different issues.  Of *course* people have
the right to comment on the show; hell, that's been going on here, both
positive and negative, since the pilot film.  You can like something, or
not like something.  But if somebody gets up an attitude and says, "Hey,
I watch your show, and I have a right to input, and you should do your
show THIS way from now on," that person is going to be told to bug off.
That the show is seen by many folks gives them an interest, and that's
great; but there's a line in *proprietary* interest that can't be
crossed.  The show that has attracted people is what I've chosen to put
in; if enough people like it, they'll continue to watch; if not, not.
