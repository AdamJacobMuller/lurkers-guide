<H2>ATTN JMS:  No Janet Greek in S</H2>
2 Nov 1995<PRE>     Janet isn't directing any episodes this season because she wanted to
take time off to work on her own screenwriting projects.  She took one or
two high-priced network gigs to fill in the gaps, plus she's squeezing in
one Hypernauts episode, but that's it.  Once she's done?|e we hope to he(?iave
her again next season (ratings willing).
