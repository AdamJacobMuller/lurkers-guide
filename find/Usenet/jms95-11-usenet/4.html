2 Nov 1995<PRE>     General note to everyone: it usually takes 5-7 days from the time a
note is posted to the group to show up on my computer here, partly because
it has to be filtered by the Rangers, partly because my newreader often
just doesn't show anything for days at a time, then I get 1,054 messages
in one huge lump.
