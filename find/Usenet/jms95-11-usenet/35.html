<H2>ATTN JMS: More SF less plot</H2>
10 Nov 1995<PRE>     Without character development, no one really cares about the science
aspect, because it doesn't affect anyone we care about.  Science fiction
is composed of two parts: the science, which we deal with where we can,
and where it's appropriate to the story, and the fiction, which must hew
to the rules of any fiction...characters you care about.  To skew the show
toward techie and away from plot or character is just to engage in mental
exercises about what effect component X might have on tachyon B...and I
tend not to find that terribly interesting.
