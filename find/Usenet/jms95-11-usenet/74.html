<H2>9 Billion Names of God and Bro</H2>
22 Nov 1995<PRE>       No, there's no connection whatsoever.  The Tibetan monks in the
story were specifically coming up with all the names of god in order to
bring about the end of the world; Theo et al have come as an exercise in
comparative religion, to learn what the other races call god, and how it
compares.  As others have done before, right here on good old earth.
