<H2>ATTN: JMS - how are the rating</H2>
6 Nov 1995<PRE>     So far, the ratings are good, and WB is pleased.  (Even had one of
the Big Guns come down here for lunch last week to hang out with the
cast, and indicate that they're pleased.)  The sweeps period beginning
this week is the real test, though.
