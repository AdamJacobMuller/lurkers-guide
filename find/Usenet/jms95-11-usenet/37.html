<H2>Episode Review (Fall of Night)</H2>
10 Nov 1995<PRE>      Paul: I'd suggest that many of the "dumb things" about the episode
are things you've concocted in your own perception.


     Much of your message is based on the premise that shadow shipw
(ships) can cloak...from this follows your notes about how come it's so
easy to break, on and on.  Shadow ships don't have cloaking devices.  They
phase in and out of hyperspace, that's all (as you'll see more clearly in
"Matters").  That's also why they can be seen in hyperspace (your other
concern).  You're making an assumption, that they can cloak, and then
using this as a basis for criticizing that cloaking being done
inconsistently, when the basic premise you're applying is incorrect.


     The shadows don't much care about if you can track them, because if
you try, you're dead.


     We haven't "deteriorated" Paul.  The error was in making assumptions
instead of simpy first asking if a given premise was accurate.


                                                                jms
