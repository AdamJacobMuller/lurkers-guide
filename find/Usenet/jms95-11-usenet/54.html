<H2>Re: Notes from jms</H2>
16 Nov 1995<PRE>     Theron, quite frankly, fuck off.  This is none of your concern.  I
have received multiple notes from people asking what can they do about
harrassment and insults and abuse from Ford.  I responded and gave them
the option, and let others similarly bothered know how to respond.  IF
no one has been abused, no one will notify AOL.  If they have, then they
will.  I didn't ask people to go out and just write complaining mail,
the letter was *specifically* directed toward those who genuinely feel
they've been abused.


     And I'd like to know where the hell you get off sticking your nose
in here.  You sit there saying I should be held accountable for every
word I write here...so why shouldn't others be held equally accountable?
Double standard.  But that's what I've come to expect from you.


     It's real simple, Theron.  It's called democracy.  If people feel
they've been abused, they have the right to say so.
