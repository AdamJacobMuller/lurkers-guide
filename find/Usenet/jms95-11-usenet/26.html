<H2>ATTN JMS: Jumppoint Question</H2>
10 Nov 1995<PRE>     Usually detectors in the ships prevent them from being formed on
top of something vital (though sometimes you *want* to do that as a
weapon)...and we *have* seen other POV shots of the gate opening, including
one from the back of the jump gate toward the oncoming ships (I think it
was in "All Alone").
