<H2>The Reson why the US will NEVE</H2>
2 Nov 1995<PRE>     Yes, I'm sure the dealers selling *illegal* copies of B5 at the
convention told you that real, licensed tapes won't be released.  Now, I
wonder why this could be...hmm....maybe to *encourage people to buy their
illegal pirated tapes, perhaps*?


     Work it out, people.
