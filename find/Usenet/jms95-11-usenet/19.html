<H2>ATTN JMS: Job</H2>
6 Nov 1995<PRE>     What would I say to one of my characters if asked to justify what I
had done to them?


     "I figured it'd make things a *lot* more interesting.  To see what
(and if) you'd learn.  Because it makes for good drama, and I like to be
entertained at this end.  Because I can.  And because I felt like it."


                                                                 jms
