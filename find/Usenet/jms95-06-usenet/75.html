<H2>ATTN JMS:  Wishlist for season</H2>
11 Jun 1995<PRE>     In looking at the story breakdown for year three, there isn't much
on that wish list physically, except for one big addition to our little
B5 universe.  Beyond that...we're going to make some modifications to
C&amp;C that I've wanted to do for some time now, add a couple of recurring
characters, do a bit more CGI than we're doing now...but the rest of the
pieces are all there.  Now it's time to just focus in on the story.
