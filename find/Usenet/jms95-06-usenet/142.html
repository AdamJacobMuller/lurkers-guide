20 Jun 1995<PRE>     RE: the bone crests on the Minbari, the notion expressed by David
Sueme detailing evolutionary notions omits the most rudimentary fact
about such things when he says it's illogical from a birth perspective:
They're not BORN that way, any more than elks are born with full-length
horns.  Like any other species that grows bony-matter outside the head
(deer, cows, bulls, certified public accountants), it's either not there
at birth or nascent.  It gradually grows out.  Ditto for the Minbari.
There are elaborate rituals of shaping and honing and cutting as one's
crest grows.  Some crests are shaped more in tune with the military caste
than the religious caste, for instance.
 
     It grows out to create a protective sheath around the back of the
head, where the internal skull can sometimes be fragile, to provide
added reinforcement.
