<H2>JMS:Why Babylon?</H2>
25 Jun 1995<PRE>     The name was mutually arrived at by the nation/sponsors of B5, and
the man who initiated the project, looking back at the original story of
Babylon as a place where different languages came together.  I'd started
to do a story about the founder of the Babylon Project, but it kinda got
shoved aside; I'll do it eventually.
