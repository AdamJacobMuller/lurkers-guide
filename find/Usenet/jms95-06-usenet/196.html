<H2>Giving JMS Feedback on last 4</H2>
24 Jun 1995<PRE>     Actually, the writing of the next batch of scripts has very little to
do with reaction to the last four; the story is the story.  And, as it
happens, the first three are now written, and I'll be starting on script
four next week.  By the time the first episode airs in the UK, we will hvae
(have) 5-6 scripts in-hand.
