<H2>Re: The Last 4 (Question)</H2>
22 Jun 1995<PRE>     I got some *very* interesting information today re: the UK airing
of the Final Four, and I'll be verifying it over the next few days.  If
what I've heard is correct, this will be *very* cool for UK viewers, who
will NOT have to wait until October.  Watch this space for updates.
