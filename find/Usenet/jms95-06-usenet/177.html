<H2>Star Trek vs. B5</H2>
22 Jun 1995<PRE>     It's also worth mentioning that one of my hopes in doing b5 is that
it will encourage others to pick up the ball when I've finished playing with
it and do other linked/novel-structured stories, so far from thinking that
ST is "ripping off" anything by adapting to a long-term structure, I'd be
quite pleased.
 
     I'd rather it weren't *my* story, but anything else...terrific.
