<H2>"Infection" revisited, was Goo</H2>
9 Jun 1995<PRE>     Yeah, I kinda guess that "Grail" would be my alternate for worst ep;
I guess I'm generally just harder on eps I wrote myself.
 
     BTW, given the reasons you cite for liking "Sky," I think you're gona
(gonna) LOVE "Comes the Inquisitor."
