<H2>ATTN JMS - A few questions....</H2>
15 Jun 1995<PRE>     We *somewhat* compose for standard aspect ratio, but often our
directors frame quite a bit off center, or have stuff going on over in
the edges, or otherwise work to make the whole thing interesting when it's
returned to widescreen format.  You will see B4 again in year three, yes.
Interesting about the war in DS9, that's all I'll say on it.
 
                                                                 jms
 
     (Except that we'll do it better.)
