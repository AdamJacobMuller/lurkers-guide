<H2>Re: Holy JMS-Re: DS9 establish</H2>
24 Jun 1995<PRE>     Ted: you're comparing apples and oranges (again).  There is a profound
difference between PTEN (to use your term) "meddling" with what dates to
SHOW the program, and Paramount "meddling" with what goes INTO the
program.  Further, I've seen just as many people here hitting critical
mass about the PTEN delay as those discussing Paramount/ST, probably more.
 
     "Does this mean that people like Franklin who criticize Trek writers
for Paramount decisions but don't criticize jms for PTEN decisions are
being hypocritical?  Absolutely."
 
     Ted...what the fuck are you talking about?  I'd like to know because
this doesn't parse on any level; it doesn't touch reality at any two
contiguous points.  A writer is responsible for only one thing: what goes
into the script.  You might as well blame the writer for some station
airing the show at 11 p.m. vs. 8 p.m.  Which is sheer madness on your
part.
 
     There is creative meddling with the program's contents, and scheduling
meddling which all happens after the contents are completed.  These are
as different as night and day.  A writer is responsible for the contents
of his/her scripts; and is NOT responsible in any way, manner, shape or
form for the scheduling of that episode.  I'm sorry, Ted, but this is one
of your more extraordinarily dumb postings, and there've been some
real whoppers, lemme tell you.
 
                                                                      jms
