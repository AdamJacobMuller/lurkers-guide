<H2>From jms....We Got Year Three</H2>
9 Jun 1995<PRE>     Since apparently this has broken on AOL via John Copeland before I
could post it...yes, I can confirm that we've been renewed for Year
Three.  I got the call late today, and have spent part of the evening
doing Producer Stuff, part trying to push through a bit of a bug that
hit last night (and thus took some of the edge off the news), and only
late this evening was able to get on-line to confirm.
 
     It's a full order for 22 episodes, and we begin shooing July 31st or
thereabouts.
 
     Thanks in particular to all of Babylon 5's "netted" friends, who have
held the Line alongside us for the preceding two years, and with whom we
hope to continue sharing the foxhole for the next three.
 
                                                                jms
