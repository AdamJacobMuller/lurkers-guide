<H2>ATTN JMS: How's the finale?</H2>
8 Jun 1995<PRE>     How does the finale compare?  Hmmm...depends on what you're looking
for.  "Inquisitor" is primarily a character piece, virtually no EFX, but
very intense.  The story is kind of straightforward, with a few kickers
along the way.  "Twilight" is a heavy story episode, that zips all over
the B5 landscape, between the Narns, the Centauri, and elsewhere (he said
vaguely).  The finale, "The Fall of Night," is actually kind of deceptive;
it starts out fairly calmly and tightens fairly fast.  The story is not
as back-and-forth or layered as Twilight or Coming, it's really about one
thing.  Visually, it's the most ambitious thing we've done to date, and
probably the most ambitious EFX stuff done for a TV series *ever*.  I
don't think you'll feel left wanting after the episode is done.
