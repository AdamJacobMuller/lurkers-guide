<H2>ATTN JMS: Question about show</H2>
9 Jun 1995<PRE>     Merchandising isn't factored against ratings; ratings are of use to
advertisers in determining how much to pay for an ad.  They don't care if
there are Londo dolls, how many people wll see their commercials?  The
merchandising is good for WB, but not if the ratings drop so that the show
can't be sustained by advertising.
