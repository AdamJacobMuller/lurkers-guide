24 Jun 1995<PRE>     Oh, hell, I forgot the one pre-eminent feature in my office: a framed
MST3K picture of Mike and TV's Frank and Dr. Foresster and the 'bots, all
signed by the relative charcters, living or robotic.
 
     It was a present for my birthday, and in return I sent 'em a box of
B5 caps.
