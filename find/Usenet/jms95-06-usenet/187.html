<H2>Re: From JMS: What Exec Prods</H2>
24 Jun 1995<PRE>     I don't think *any* topic is off-limits when it comes to discussing
B5, because no topic is off-limits when it comes to *making* B5.  So
questions/discussions of costumes, makeup, EFX, philosophy, mathematics
(not Joseph's skill, however), set design...whatever.  I may not always
have an answer, but I'll either find one or come up with a reasonably
plausible alibi.
