<H2>ATTN JMS:Harlan Ellison o</H2>
22 Jun 1995<PRE>     Unfortunately, Bob, you are one of those people of whom Harlan
speaks when he says you have no sense of the real history of the story
behind ST.  He did more than just write "City"...he brought in ohter
SF writers, rewrote them on the QT in some cases, fronted ST to SFWA and
vice versa; he was the one who fronted a mass mailing to leading SF pros
and other urging them to do all they could to keep the show on the air
when it looked like it was going to be canceled at the end of its second
season.
 
     He did more beyond that, but that's a start.  So on that count, you
are absolutely wrong and ignorant of the facts.
 
     Item #2, he has never "cheated or swindled" the authors involved with
"The Last Dangerous Visions."  Each author was paid, with a fee that
covers X-amount of time.  At the end of X-amount of time, he sends another
check to renew his right to publish those stories.  Any author who wants
to pull his story, can do so, and some have.  Most haven't, and are
content to wait.
 
     The paralogia you exhibit in your message is blatant and sad.  You
try to attack his statements on ST with false and uninformed opinion, then
drag in TLDV as if to somehow verify his lack of character in speaking his
mind about Star Trek.  Using anything, however false or irrelevant, to
discredit the messenger who's saying stuff you don't want to hear.
 
     Tough.
