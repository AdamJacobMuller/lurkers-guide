<H2>JMS:  Is it getting easier?</H2>
15 Jun 1995<PRE>     Easier?  It never gets any easier.  (Nor should it.  The minute it
becomes something you toss off quickly, easily, is the moment you should
get out of the business.)  If anything, it gets harder, because you're
constantly trying to out-do what you did last week.
