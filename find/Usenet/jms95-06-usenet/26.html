<H2>JMS: Music tastes?</H2>
5 Jun 1995<PRE>     Actually, I listen to just about every kind of music there is, except
hard-core country-western, which I can't abide.  I have a fairly large
collection of music, and stuff goes in and out depending on my mood and
what I'm writing.  In rock, I'm partial to Peter Gabriel, Phil Collins,
Melissa Etheridge, Meatloaf, Indigo Girls, Billy Joel, Enya, Slade and
a lot of others.  I always go for strong individual voices and strong
writing.  I'm a sucker for the kind of music that makes you start pounding
your arm on the arm of your chair and makes the hair on the back of your
neck stand up.  Bonnie Tyler stuff.
 
     Other than that...classical, a *little* new wave, Celtic, Japanese
(KODO music in particular), Aboriginal music, medeival music, jazz,
big-band (LOTS of big band), musicals, soundtracks...you name it.
