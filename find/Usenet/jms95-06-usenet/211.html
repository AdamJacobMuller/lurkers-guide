25 Jun 1995<PRE>     J. Potts...your report reflects exactly what I'd been afraid of,
that the event was going to be an organizational disaster.  The cast were
game to go for the fans, and I'm glad to see that they did okay in that
regard, but they can't do much about how the con is organized.  This all
pretty much confirms that my concerns were justified.
