<H2>JMS:  "What I really want to d</H2>
22 Jun 1995<PRE>     I dunno...I keep going back and forth on this.  For my purposes it's
easier to find directors who see the show my way, and hire them; and not
the ones who don't.  I sometimes consider directing -- mainly because it
makes John Copeland get all twitchy every time I broach the subject, and I
like to watch him vibrate into another dimension -- but mainly...it'd
require getting up WAY too early.  My agent says I'm nuts for not taking
the opporunity, which is there, if I wanted it.  But so far...ehhh.....
