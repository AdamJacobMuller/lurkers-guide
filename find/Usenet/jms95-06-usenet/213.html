<H2>ATTN JMS: Ideas to help newbie</H2>
28 Jun 1995<PRE>     We broached the idea of a one-hour "Mysteries of
Babylon 5" special to PTEN; unfortunately, it seems problematic.  Fox can
set aside a block of time because it's a true network; PTEN would have
to go to each station individually and sell the one-hour show, and that
is apparently very difficult.
