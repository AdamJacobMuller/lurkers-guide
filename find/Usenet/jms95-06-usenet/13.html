<H2>Technobabylon</H2>
2 Jun 1995<PRE>     Michael, you're confusing your terms.  You can't say that because
B5 has rotational artificial gravity that therefore this equals
technobabble.
 
     Science fiction -- note, SCIENCE fiction -- relies on elements of
technology.  You cannot have SF without some element of changed or
new technology.  Thus your notion that ANY technology = technobabble
means that ALL SF is technobabble.  In so doing, the term loses all
meaning.
 
     Technobabble specifically refers to paragraph after paragraph of
dialogue explaining how the neutrino filters invert the tachyon field
distancing array and corrupt the magnetic flow systems into an inert
state...which is later solved by MORE technobabble.  The operative word
here is BABBLE, which in this case means to go on and on.
