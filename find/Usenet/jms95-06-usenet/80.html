<H2>Re: Are B5 Scripts Available?</H2>
12 Jun 1995<PRE>     The long cuts exist only in the computer; there was never a fully
extended, on-film ep cut down for time.  Once we make our cuts on the
computer, the film is assembled only once, for the final product.  We'd
have to go in and re-edit EVERYthing to make it work.
