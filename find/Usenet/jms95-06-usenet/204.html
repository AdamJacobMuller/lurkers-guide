<H2>ATTN JMS: Who checks your scri</H2>
24 Jun 1995<PRE>    Generally speaking, not that much checking needs to be done; I try to
write from what I know, or can research on my own.  In a few cases, we've
brough in advisors in specific areas; military advisors for GROPOS,
medical advisors on "Confessions", that sort of thing.
