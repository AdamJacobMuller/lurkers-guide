<H2>ATTN, JMS: Jumpgate question</H2>
27 Jun 1995<PRE>     You might as well ask who invented the computer.  The principles have
always been there, written in the universe for people to decode, as we
have been doing throughout centuries.  At various points, races stumble
upon items like jumpgate technology the same way they stumble upon fire,
or radium, or the piston engine.
