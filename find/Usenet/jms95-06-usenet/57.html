<H2>ATTN JMS:  The great stories..</H2>
9 Jun 1995<PRE>     I actually don't think there are only X number of stories.  I've
heard this theory, and don't subscribe to it.  There are as many stories
as there are people.  Then again, someone once wrote, "Of course everything
has been said; but since nobody was paying attention, we must begin again."
 
                                                                jms
 
     (My usual definition of a story: what does A want, how far is he
willing to go to get it, and how far will someone else go to stop him?
That makes every story individual to the person's background.)
