<H2>Attn JMS: Little Lost Delenn</H2>
17 Jun 1995<PRE>     Well, it's about TIME somebody noticed that little exchange in
"Confessions and Lamentations."  Sometimes I stick stuff so obviously in
the foreground that I'm afraid it's going to be too blatant, and then
nobody seems to notice it, looking instead at the tiny stuff in the
background.
 
     Unfortunately, all I can say for now is that it is significant to
Delenn's character and growth, and her sense of being special, and called
into the religious caste.
