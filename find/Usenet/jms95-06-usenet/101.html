<H2>One eensy moderation concern..</H2>
15 Jun 1995<PRE>     I don't get the alt. group.  I get only this one internet group,
through the good offices of Ron Jarrell.  I deliberately don't accept
any of the free Internet offers that are occasionally made, and don't
slip out into other areas.  This is the only one I get, via my GEnie
mailbox.
