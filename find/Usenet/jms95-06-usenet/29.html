<H2>ATTN JMS: Have You Gotten Ever</H2>
5 Jun 1995<PRE>     Yeah, there was one thing I didn't get, only because those involved
kind of imploded.  The final revelatory scene at the end of "The Long
Dark" was supposed to be one HELL of a lot more impressive than it was.
I really wanted to see something extraordinary.  What we got...wasn't
it.  That's the only case that I can remember.  PTEN has never come to us
and said, "Joe...it's too weird."  Performance wise, I think the part of
Inspector Cranston in "Hunter/Prey" could've been better executed.  But
overall, I have to say I'm very satisfied.
