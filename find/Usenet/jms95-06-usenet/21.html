<H2>Why are you here (rastb5)?</H2>
3 Jun 1995<PRE>     The notion that I'm asking for no story ideas to be posted so that I
can rip off story ideas is the most lame-brain statement I have heard in
10+ years of being on the nets.  Saying "no story ideas" doesn't kee
anyone from suing; it just keeps useable ideas out of where I can see them,
period.
 
     I have said, often, and repeatedly, and clearly, why I am here.  The
problem is that you have one or two absolute mindless conniving distrustful
fuckheads who have no perceivable life other than to try and ride my ass
about one thing or another, swinging from one stupid theory to another to
another with as much astonishing speed and illogic as the Simpson defense
team.  They will seize upon anything, ANYthing, and try and twist it around
to try and convince others that somehow, somewhichway, I'm getting away
with something, I'm conning people, I'm lying, I'm actually Reichminister
Goebbels who set up a twin for the little WW II misunderstanding and am
currently trying to sneak back into the United States disguised as Rondo
Hatton.
 
     Loonies and feebs and creeps, oh my.
 
     Okay, you want it straight up?  Here it is.  I'm here for a number of
reasons.  1) I like to get kind of a sense of the room; I'm not going to
change anything, but writing for TV is like writing for a vacuum; you nevr
(never) get to see the reaction.  This is the ONLY chance I get to get a
reaction to something I've written and produced, and maybe it's ego, maybe
it's just that I work very hard to make something effective,and want to see
if it had the desired effect.  Writers and artists and singers are like
that.
 
     2) I think that TV producers in general get a very skewed sense of
who's in the audience.  This exchange gives access to people across the
country to someone who makes TeeVee, and lets me hear them.  How often
would someone in Clearwater, Oklahoma, have the chance to express an
opinion to someone in LA making a TV series?  Not bloody often.  And that
is in large measure, I think, why TV has become so insular.  And so
unresponsive to its audience.  So I'm kind of a test-case volunteer for
this, in the hopes of luring more producers onto the nets and creating a
more open exchange, making producers accountable for what they make.
 
     3) I've dedicated over 15 years of my life to trying to demystify
TV production and writing.  I've written columns and columns, reams of
articles, a book...all trying to help people understand how this medium
works, because you can't control or influence something unless you truly
UNDERSTAND it...why things are done a certain way.  This is part of an
educational project that I've been doing for over a decade, a natural
outgrowth of that process.  By the time this is all done, there will be
an online document of hundreds of archival pages -- maybe thousands --
covering the development, birth and ongoing creation of a TV series at a
depth never before chronicled, which will be available to students and
universities and ordinary folks.  I think that's a valuable experiment.
 
     Finally: 4) I'm an SF fan.  I think SF fans are, overall, the most
exploited bunch around.  They're expected to line up, buy the toys,
watch the show and shut the hell up.  I think it's time some respect for
that audience was shown by allowing them a voice.  This is part of my
sense of personal obligation to the field that spawned many wonderful
years of reading.
 
     My request has always been just that, a request, and a simply stated
one.  You can talk about story ideas all you want.  But I simply cannot be
here if you do that.  I will not run the risk of being sued, or having the
show that I've labored over for, now, eight years being victimized by some
crazed yahoo who posts something and then decides I've ripped him off,
despite the fact that this material has been sitting in my computer for
YEARS.  And a Crazed Yahoo (tm) doesn't have to win, doesn't even think
he may have a chance to win...but defending a case can run hundreds of
thousands of dollars, thanks to our wonderful legal system, and can tie
up episodes for years.
 
     You cay some of these people think the chances of a lawsuit are
"ignorable."  Yeah, for them.  They're not the ones at risk.  If they're
wrong, it's "Oh, huh, guess I was wrong."  For me it's several years of
courtrooms, lawyers, depositions and the like.  It's frankly not their
call to make.  It's mine.  Warners knows I'm here, and I periodically
have to reassure them that I'm keeping the promise about not exposing the
show to risk.  And I have to maintain that stance, or vanish.
 
     I would remind a very few of the feebs I noted before that in fact,
there WAS no rec.arts.b5 area until I showed up on the alt group.  At
that point, membership jumped *dramatically* enough to merit the
formation of a rec.arts group.  I have no particular infatuation with my
own sense of importance -- much the contrary -- but I do know that my
being here is in many ways directly responsible for there BEING a
B5 rec group.  Now I'm being told, "Hey, why make special rules for him,
who cares, let him blow off if he doesn't like it."
 
     Not a special rule.  Just courtesy.  Plain and simple.  Why is it
that one can no longer simply make a request out of courtesy?  Instead one
must now back it up with lengthy treatises about legalities and laws and
risk factors...and one's own personal motivations are challenged and
questioned and suspected and put on trial and smeared by a callous few to
whom the very concept of "courtesy" is a foreign idea, and who exist only
to bring grief to me and the bulk of users here.  There are PLENTY of
ways for people to suggest story ideas to one another without exposing
them to me...email lists, private groups, whatever.
 
     The theory, as I understand it, is that people are coming up with
story ideas because they like the show.  Why, therefore, would they
choose to *endanger* the show by posting them where I can see it?  I had
this recently with a fanzine publisher who turned down a B5 fictional
story because I'd asked, politely, that none be published until after the
show had ended.  The writer got very upset and said, "Well, who CARES what
he wants?"  The side-product was more important than the creation that
spawned it.
 
     I've made my motivations clear from day one.  Anyone who wants to
challenge them can go fuck themselves, I don't have to answer to them or
give them any credence whatsoever by even acknowleging them.  It's in all
the faq files from the beginning; let them go do some research, it's all
there.  They pick on this today; tomorrow they'll move onto something
else, because they don't actually CARE about the truth.  They care about
being hyenas, and biting at people who didn't bow down and kiss their
respective asses.
 
     And frankly, that to me has become one of the most wearing aspects of
being online; the wackos and creeps who just live to make trouble.  For
that reason alone, I sometimes think, "Fuck it, I don't need this, I don't
need to go to bed angry, I don't need the distraction when I'm trying to
write, I'm doing this to do a Nice Thing.  Period.  And if all I'm going
to get is a few relentless assholes bitching at me 24 hours a day, then
the hell with it."  Then the sane part of me remembers that the word FEW
appears in that sentence.  And that these few jerks are irrelevant, despite
their attempts to create relevancy for themselves by attacking others.  And
I calm down, and after a bit, log back on again.
 
     To continue the experiment, as outlined above.
 
     And that's the sum and substance of it.  It's really a question of
which people prefer: having access to the producer of Babylon 5, or
blowing out huge story ideas.  There can be one, but not the other.  It
ain't the best case scenario, but it's the only workable one.  It's my show
that would be at risk otherwise, and I'm sorry, but on that count noboty
(nobody) else gets a vote.  Nobody else is entitled to determine the
risk factor, or determine if it's relevant.  That's my call.  And should
enough people decide their story ideas are what they really want to
discuss, or even a few (it only takes a couple to pose sufficient risk),
then I'll simply have to fade outta here.
 
     Because the experiment will continue, on other systems.  Compuserve,
GEnie, others...where the understanding is respected, and courtesy rises
above self-interest or unwarranted personal attacks.  And AS HAS BEEN THE
CASE HERE, I should point out, since this thing began.  If a few people
want to change that, well, that's their right.  I just can't be here if
it happens.  That simple.
 
     And yes, you can repost this, but if you do in the public forums,
do so in toto.  The usual band of self-styled critics/hatchet folks will
get all bent out of shape because I used a couple naughty words here and
there, and because I got all bent out of shape simply because they did
something as innocuous as impugning my motives and implying theft on a
daily, consistent basis, but y'know what?
 
     Fuck 'em.
 
                                                                  jms
