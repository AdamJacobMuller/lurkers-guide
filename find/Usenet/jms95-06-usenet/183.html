<H2>Re: ATTN JMS:Harlan Ellison o</H2>
23 Jun 1995<PRE>     Please cite for me, Rob, those stories you've heard about literary
assassination by Harlan.  I would like to see them.  Invariably they are
total fiction of grossly exaggerated by those who want to do harm.
 
     As for not delivering a book manuscript for X-years...this is not a
big deal, frankly, and it's not the business of anyone not directly
involved.  Hell, I've been trying for the last six years to finish the
revisions to the scriptwriting book; I've said I was just about finished,
only to get hammered by something and time slips.  It happens to every
writer.
 
     And the same people who say, "Why hasn't he finished his work?" are
the ones who chivvy and harrass him, send him abusive mail, subscribe him
to magazines he doesn't want, start organizations like Enemies of
Ellison, and do everything they can to wind him up to the point where
nobody could get ANY work done.  That he's delivered as much as he has,
equal to or more than my output on any year, is amazing, given that this
is ALSO the man with Epstein/Barr (Chronic Fatigue Syndrome) and has had
two heart attacks and two surgical heart procedures.
 
     Gee, I wonder why he's distracted.
 
     Priest and the rest of his ilk should get a fucking life and maybe do
some work of their own instead of harrassing Harlan.
 
                                                                   jms
