<H2>ATTN JMS: Shadow Archetypes?</H2>
10 Jun 1995<PRE>     How Jungian are the shadows?   Hrrmmmm...that's a hard one to
answer, because in part it requires revealing more than I want to at the
moment.  To varying extents, yes, certainly.  But there are also some
elements of Joseph Campbell, the Old Testament, and Freud.
