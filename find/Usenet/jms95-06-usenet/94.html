<H2>Attn JMS: The future of B5 if.</H2>
13 Jun 1995<PRE>     If something happens to me...nobody gets the notes.  The whole POINT
is that this is a personal story, told out of a personal vision.  So if
you want to see this story finished, it behooves y'all to keep my sorry
ass alive for the next 3 years.
