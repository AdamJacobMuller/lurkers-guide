<H2>ATTN  JMS:  What's the office</H2>
20 Jun 1995<PRE>     Actually, my office ain't much to write home about.  Main thing is,
where all of the offices and walls in the office area here at the B5
studios are white, mine is painted battleship grey.  Brown desk, black
sofa and cabinet, TV and small stereo.  A few B5 items here and there,,q\,
including a model vorlon transport made and hand-painted by Ron, a couple
of awards.  On the walls: not much, a woodcut of a skeletal dwarf riding
a flying pig and carrying a scythe; a shot of the B5 station; the season
two/three B5 poster; calendar; and my schedule board where I keep track of
scripts, which is adorned with huge (1.5 foot by 3 foot) boards, one on
either side, which contain individual quotes.  I swap out the quotes on a
regular basis.  On now: "To define is to kill, to suggest is to create,"
Mallarme.  "The point of no return; that is the point that must be
reached," Franz Kafka.
