<H2>--Why I'm upset with DS9 and V</H2>
16 Jun 1995<PRE>     An aside to the discussion: I often hear folks who defend DS9, and
some *with* DS9, say they can't do much action because they can't afford
it.  I have *no* idea why this should be so, as a) both the current ST
shows use a hell of a lot more stock footage than we ever do, and b) both
ST shows have roughly twice the budget we have per episode.
