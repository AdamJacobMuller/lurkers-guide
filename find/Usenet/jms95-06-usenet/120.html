<H2>JMS?? Re: RFD: rec.arts.sf.tv.</H2>
16 Jun 1995<PRE>     I was asked if I wanted to be part of the discussion on this, and I
opted out, because I don't want to be in the position of unduly pressuring
anyone; I also barely understand the internet structure, and couldn't
add much of substance anyway.  Just end up muddying the waters further.
 
     Nor would my feelings on this be of much use, since they are totally
conflicted.  I like the free-ranging discussion that comes with an
unmoderated group.  On the other, there are more and more story ideas
being posted in the course of speculation.  One or two that I stumbled
across scared the hell out of me, though fortunately they ended up going
off in directions I had no intention of going in.
 
     I don't generally access internet through any other venue than this
one, provided by Ron Jarrell through my GEnie gateway, which minimizes my
contact with the net.
 
     My hope was that in not influencing the discussion, those minds which
understood the situation could come to some reasonable compromise
situation.  I do think that Jay has come down a tad harder than I would
have in similar circumstances, but that does not negate the core of the
concerns; I did not initiate this whole moderation debate, but it was bound
to become an issue sooner or later.
 
     What I've told Ron, and Jay, and others, is that I want a solution that
affects/impinges on others as little as possible.  This is, fundamentally,
MY problem, and I've always felt uncomfortable making others compensate
for my problem.  So I simply, honestly don't know what to do.  (I know that
Ron has some ideas he's going to call about next week, so maybe he'll have
a solution.)
 
     There are times I do think it'd be better and simpler for me just to
withdraw from internet, since after all I can still be reached easily via
email, and my address is on the nets, so folks wouldn't have a hard time
reaching me.  But I don't know if that's right either.
 
     All of which should give you some idea of why I'm not doing much in
this discussion; I can pretty convincingly argue just about every point of
view.
 
                                                                  jms
