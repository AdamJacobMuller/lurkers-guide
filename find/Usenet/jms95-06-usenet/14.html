<H2>Re: Britain - last,best hope t</H2>
2 Jun 1995<PRE>     Wait...I wuz wrong.  We checked personally with the Channel 4
programmers, who are out here on the West Coast for an international TV
big-deal, and apparently they *are* going to hold up on the last four
just 2-3 weeks, specifically because to air it would be to put it up
against the Tour de France, and nobody would ever see the darned thing.
Just a slight delay, a couple/three weeks...hey, could be worse, could
be October.
