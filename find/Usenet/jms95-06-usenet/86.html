<H2>JMS: A quick question.</H2>
12 Jun 1995<PRE>     Bear in mind, the 200 pages of notes aren't per se a straightforward
outline; as I worked out bits of the story, I added it to the material
as I went along, so sometimes you have year three stuff right alongside
year five stuff.  Each season I go through my notes, pull out the stuff
relevant to that season, put it in the right order, and fill in any gaps
in-between.
