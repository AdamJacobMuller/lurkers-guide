<H2>Mr. JMS: Media Bias?</H2>
15 Jun 1995<PRE>     How can "Word" be a commentary on current allegations of bias (which
I think are out of all proportion) since the media is now supposedly
anti-government (nonsense), and the newscast in ""Word" was more than just
a bit spoon-fed government propaganda?
