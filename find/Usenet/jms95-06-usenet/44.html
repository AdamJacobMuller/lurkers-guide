8 Jun 1995<PRE>      I have direct control/approval over every aspect of the show, but I
try as much as possible to leave the talented people alone to pursue their
vision of the show.  In the case of prosthetics, when a new race comes
aboard, the elves at Optic Nerve will generally come up with several or
just a few sketches.  I review those sketches, and if there's one they
prefer, I go with that one, unless I feel strongly otherwise.  Other
times they have no real preference.  Once approved, they proceed apace,
and I'll see it one more time when the sculpture's finished, then not
again until it's on the stage.
