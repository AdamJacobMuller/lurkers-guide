14 Jun 1995<PRE>     Whether one becomes religious, warrior or worker caste is something
that arises early on, not through birth or genetics, but what you are
called to do, or feel called to do.  If you believe that you are calleed
to the religious life, you go to that part for a time, a few years, and
that is determined by you and to a certain extent, others.  If you seem
not suited toward that, they may work with you to find what you are more
suited for (and perhaps you felt *expected* to be called a certain way,
but that's not really where you're best suited).
