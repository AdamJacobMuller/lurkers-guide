<H2>Re: Someone's Impersonating jm</H2>
7 Jun 1995<PRE>     I never see Fulleristic messages directly, because I kill the notde
(note) as soon as the name appears on my screen, but seeing this small
quote in Wayne Humfleet's message about DF calling the B5 production
office...I'm pleased to see that admission.  Basically, the call was to
complain to the office about me, read what I'd been writing on the nets
in answer to DF's attempts at glossalalia (not *entirely* sure I spelled
that right), in an attempt to make trouble and get me off the nets.
 
     This is the difference between us.  I do not call her office, or her
school, or her employers, to complain about the nutty, libelous thnigs
(things...fingers are tired) she says here.  But folks like her, and a
few others, because they can't win on the merits of their arguments, they
seek to shut the other person down.  They fax complaints to Warner Bros.,
they call my place of work and complain.
 
     It is, frankly, the very lowest form of net behavior I've ever seen.
If you can't win, try and silence the opposition.  But hey, it worked for
the brown shirts, right...?
