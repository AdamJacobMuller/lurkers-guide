<H2>Re: Are B5 Scripts Available?</H2>
11 Jun 1995<PRE>     Recognizing that some folks would like to examine the scripts (hell,
if I were out there, I'd be kinda curious), once the B5 Fan Club gets up
and running (we're nearly there to getting the darned thing approved after
negotiating with WB for nearly a year), there are plans afoot to release a
limited number of B5 scripts for sale through this venue, so they're
properly authorized and complete.
 
     The word "complete" is important because in, oh, 95% of the cases,
some dialogue ends up on the cutting room floor.  Sometimes it's only a
few lines or words, sometimes it's a short scene, or several paragraphs
worth of dialogue which add to the scene, but when we got into editing,
felt weren't *absolutely necessary* (and we're always long on our eps,
from my sense that it's better to have more story than time than more
time than story).  (And no, expanded episodes won't ever be available on
tape or disk.)  All that material will be available in these scripts.
 
     Give us another couple months on this one.
 
                                                                  jms
