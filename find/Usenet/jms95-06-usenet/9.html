1 Jun 1995<PRE>     It should also help in all these discussions to remember the
way the machine functions; it's not so much an alien HEALING device as an
alien LIFE TRANSFERRAL device.  If someone is actually dying, or close to
it, the only way to save that person is to take the life from someone
else.  So you really don't gain anything (which was why they used
condemned murderers for the original device).
