<H2>Britain - last,best hope thwar</H2>
1 Jun 1995<PRE>     Okay, folks, CALm DOWn.  Ch 4 hasn't gotten the last batch yet
only because we're finishing the last bits of tweaking.  "Twilight" is
totally finished.  "Divided Loyalties" is getting the final EFX put in
this week, and will probably be delivered to WB on Friday.  (This would
be the first up of the last batch.)  "Confessions" is finished and scored
absent 2 EFX shots, which will be in tomorrow, and we'll probably deliver
on Monday/Tuesday, with "The Fall of Night" delivered about a week after
that.  They'll have the episodes in time to play them.
