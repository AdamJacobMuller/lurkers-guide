<H2>ATTN JMS: Writing Software Que</H2>
28 Jun 1995<PRE>     I used to use Wordstar, with macros to adjust dialogue margins,
almost constantly in writing scripts.  Then the last two places I worked,
including Universal and "Murder, She Wrote" went over to Movie Master,
which is basically a no-brainer script program that has all the margins
and formatting set up.  After learning that one, it kinda stuck, and
that's the one I use now for B5.
