<H2>ATTN JMS: *Is* B5 History Bein</H2>
23 Jun 1995<PRE>     The closest thing to a history is something I've been working on a
bit here and there, trying to put together a daily (or twice-weekly)
journal on the making of the third season, filling in backstory along
the way.  We'll see if I can keep this sucker going throughout the
season.
