<H2>OFFICIAL RENEWELL!!!!</H2>
8 Jun 1995<PRE>     Well, this is all well and good, but what's odd is that as of the
moment I'm writing this, NOBODY has said *boo* to us about renewal being
official yet, from Warner Bros.  I have a vague suspicion that something
is rumbling around the corporate WB offices that involves PTEN in some
way, but I have no clue whatsoever what that is, or even IF it is, could
just be swamp gas.  It's certainly a good omen, but it ain't official
until somebody calls us from WB or PTEN, tells us, and we're authorized
to exercise our option on cast and production staff for year three.
