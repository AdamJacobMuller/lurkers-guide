<H2>Why I'm Here: Addendum</H2>
4 Jun 1995<PRE>     Only because I'm an idiot, and I forgot, and I thought it was implicit
in the message I wrote, but sometimes implicit isn't sufficiently clear
(certainly not when I'm behind the keyboard)....
 
     The other aspect is that you're all (well, mostly) a bunch of cuties.
 
     Occasional nincompoops notwithstanding...I see more well-considered,
substantive, bright and funny comments here than I can count.  There isn't
a day that goes by that I don't sit here and perk up at a particularly
insightful message, or laugh at the latest Top Ten or whatever.  The
majority of messages here are nothing less than terrific, and I hope that
that implication was clear enough in my message(s); if not, take it from
this one.
 
     As for the few weasels...my spousal overunit has a great saying:
"Don't fight the rabbits; the lions'll get you."
