28 Jun 1995<PRE>     There does seem to be some symbolism in that, though I think it came
more subconsciously than consciously; the Narns and Centauri classify the
other as the deadly enemy, but the visible fights and woundings have come
from their own kind.  We are always our own worst enemies.
 
     Though that will change, shortly.
