<H2>Channel 4 - Right to Reply.</H2>
19 Jun 1995<PRE>     If you have the opportunity, please convey to Channel 4 the
following from me: My undying thanks to everyone at Channel Four who
have supported Babylon 5, and who have demonstrated remarkable patience
with what has apparently been a flood of messages, phone calls, letters
and skywriting incidents.  (Well, okay, I made up the last one.)  From the
proverbial horse's mouth...we have now delivered to Warner Bros. two of
the remaining four episodes.  The first was delivered three weeks ago,
the second about a week ago.  The third should be in their hands this
week, the last a bit thereafter.  I have no clear understanding what the
airing arrangements might be between C4 and Warners, but any support that
we can provide is there for the asking.
 
     We sometimes allow ourselves the conceit that Babylon 5 has a very
British feel to it, as much of the better SF has come from the UK, and
its tone is not far from what we do.  We are thus inestimably pleased by
the great support C4 has shown for the series, the friendliness, courtesy
and patience of its staffers, and we look forward to a long and
productive relationship.
 
     Now, about that six p.m. timeslot....
 
                              sincerely, J. Michael Straczynski
                              executive producer/creator, BABYLON 5
