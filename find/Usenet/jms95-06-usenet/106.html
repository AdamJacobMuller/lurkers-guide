14 Jun 1995<PRE>     Thanks.  That scene in "Coming of Shadows" is one of my favorites;
it does, as you say, convey that sense of wonder which is one of my main
goals with this show.
 
     Until "The Long Twilight Struggle," nothing else has come close to
that scene for me.  But there's some stuff in there that finally manages
to surpass it.  Just gorgeous and scary and awe-inspiring.
 
                                                                  jms
