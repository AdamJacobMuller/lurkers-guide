<H2>ATTN JMS: No Na'Toth? But you</H2>
27 Jun 1995<PRE>     No, I never said that the character of Na'Toth was needed to relay
information to another character.  (It would be infinitely better if the
tens of thousand of people you cite who memorize every comment checked
the actual statement, 'cause often it's misphrased from memory, and then
I get held accountable for it.)  I said that she had to have certain
information, period.  Specifically, when G'Kar came back, I needed
someone there who he could talk to about the shadows, and get us into
that part.  Someone who knew he'd been gone, and why.  Otherwise, he'd
be spilling his guts to a total stranger, and he wouldn't *do* that.
Hence, you need Na'Toth.
