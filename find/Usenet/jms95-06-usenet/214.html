28 Jun 1995<PRE>     Hardin: the key issue, always, is the introduction of new plot
elements and actions not previously introduced.  It's the difference
between saying what something may *mean*, and suggesting something that
may *happen*.  The more precise the suggestion, the more problematic it
becomes.
