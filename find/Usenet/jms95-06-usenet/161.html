<H2>Re: DS9 War?</H2>
22 Jun 1995<PRE>     Yeah, the bit where Sinclair gets his link/hand tangled in his coat
was scripted that way.  He wasn't sure about it at first, didn't know if
it would look goofy or not, but it looked real, and that's what I wanted.
Invariably, when a new script comes out, one or another actor reacts with,
"He wants me to do WHAT?"  (fill in the blanks...sing a Gilbert&amp;Sullivan
style libretto, orgasm on camer, do the hokey pokey)  But it nearly always
works out.
