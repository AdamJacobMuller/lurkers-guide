<H2>JMS: Plausable deniability?</H2>
28 Jun 1995<PRE>     I have made considerable mention that I don't access the internet
any other way.  Proving access is key to any legal problems.  If I'm here
posting regularly, that de facto proves access.  If I'm not, it becomes
more difficult to prove.
 
     Second, the material *is* all put away, and dated, but the key isn't
just winning the case, which would happen; I just would rather not spend
the next 2 years of my life subsequent to a problem in depositions, and
hearings, and more hearings, and closeted with lawyers in the course of
defending myself against somebody.
 
                                                                    jms
