<H2>Do actors _like_ doing cons?</H2>
20 Jun 1995<PRE>     Insofar as I know, *all* of our cast enjoy going to cons, perhaps
mainly because they do NOT see it in terms of "drooling SF geeks" or "holy
reverence."  This is their show as much as mine; they work hard, and they
respect and appreciate their audience.
 
     Ask anyone here who was at Babcom in Birmingham.  Or at Marcon in
Ohio.  Peter was always accessible, friendly, hung out; we all went double
the allotted time to make sure everyone got an autograph (we signed 3,000
in two days, probably more).  Richard and Jerry hung out with fans at the
Marcon, in the bar, the lounge, the green room, room parties.  Theydo seem
to honestly enjoy the exchange.
