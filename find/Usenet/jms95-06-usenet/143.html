20 Jun 1995<PRE>     Re: Patricia Swan....AH!  Another pen-lover.  Dittos all around.  I
love pens.  All kinds pens.  But clearly the fountain pen is my favorite.
For my money, the Parker fountain pens are always the best.  I tried the
Mont Blancs for a while, didn't work for me.  But the Parker Centennial,
the Sonnet and the Duofold are terrific pens.  (Did you know they're
discontinuing the Duofold?  Rushed out and picked up two more when I
heard that.)
 
     In the category of "This is god's way of telling you you've got too
much money," I noted an ad from Nakimi for a fountain pen made of layers
of Japanese Urushi lacquer, carved maple, ornately wrought designs of
18-karet gold and hand-wrought silver.  A strikingly beautiful pen.
 
     Price?  $6,000.
 
     You gotta be outta your mind....
