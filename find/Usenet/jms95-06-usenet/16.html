<H2>JMS: Comes the Inquisitor?</H2>
3 Jun 1995<PRE>     "CtI is the only episode in the last four that we know nothing about."
 
     And if I figure out how I happened to achieve that (short of just
keeping my big yap shut), I'll do it some more.  There should be some
surprises, yes?
 
     And it's an arc story, yes, but in a very odd way.
