<H2>TREK IS BEST</H2>
3 Jun 1995<PRE>     Dear Ryan: regarding your comment that DS9 and the other ST shows are
superior because they use "real models" instead of CGI...they DO, in fact,
use CGI ships in all their shows, including Voyager, and they use THE SAME
COMPANY WE DO, Foundation Imaging.  (They just finished doing a Solar
Sailing vessel for, I think, DS9.)
 
     In short...you don't have a clue what you're talking about.
