<H2>Re: Holy JMS-Re: DS9 establish</H2>
23 Jun 1995<PRE>     Excuse me, Michelle, but I resent your message.  I have absolutely
NO control whatsoever to the airing schedule of Babylon 5; I can help
set up which episodes within a given period will air, in what order, but
when PTEN decides that NO episodes are going to air in that period, there
ain't squat I can do about it, and believe me, I tried; I can't count the
numbers of phone calls I made, to no effect.  To take a situation over
which I have no control, which I didn't know when I was writing or
producing the episodes, about which I am *very* upset, and try to make
me responsible for that, and therefore that I am a hypocrite for holding
back the great war, is just about as low as one can get.
 
     Further, you're operating out of what you think the war is.  It's one
large war that spirals into another.  The Narns and the Centauri are at
war.  You can't just dismiss it as the trigger; thousands of Narns and
many Centauri are *dying*.  And the last four episodes are planned to
escalate the hell out of this.
 
     I'm sorry if it's not sufficiently nasty at this point to satisfy
your bloodthirstiness.
