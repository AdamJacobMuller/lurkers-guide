<H2>Re: ITB - the Party in Portland - Afterwords (no spoilers)</H2>
9 Jan 1998<PRE>At the LA party, there was a second level above the one where we were all
hanging out, and civilians were shooting pool and carrying on at the second
level until an employee went to talk to them.  A beat later, one of them, a
woman, leaned over the rail to look down at what we were doing (having been
oblivious to it prior to this), saw the TVs showing ItB, and turned to her
companion, saying, "Oh...it's something to do with Star Trek."
