<H2>Re: ATTN: JMS   wait and see?</H2>
2 Jan 1998<PRE>&gt;I'm wondering if both you and WB are waiting to see the B5 ratings on
&gt;TNT before finalizing a deal on Crusade.
&gt;
&gt;

Nope.  The contract has been sent to me for signing several times, and each
time it has had some problem or another that needed fixing.  (See, this is how
the process works: your agent and the studio negotiate over the phone.  Come to
terms.  Deal memos go out, which often don't reflect the conversations, but
they hope you won't notice.  You catch the "errors" and send back the memos. 
Next come the actual contracts, and sonuvagun, more "errors" have slipped
through, and now THEY need to be corrected, if you can find them in the 90
pages of 8 point type.  So that's been the only real holdup.  It's standard.)
