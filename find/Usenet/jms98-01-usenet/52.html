1) The separation left-right isn't correct, so it muddies the sound.

2) We had to do audoi grabs from episodes for the first pass at the main
titles, since there wasn't opportunity to revoice the lines and make them
clearer.  Starting around episode 7 or so, we dropped in the re-do's and made
the thing clearer overall.
