<H2>Re: San Jose Merc's Faint Praise for B5</H2>
5 Jan 1998<PRE>The San Jose Mercury basically predicted our demise a long time ago, and
critics have a way of getting snippy when what they say will happen, doesn't. 
We've seen that in a few other reviews as well.  They don't like having their
noses (and their predictions) rubbed in our success.
