<H2>jms note re: tapings</H2>
9 Jan 1998<PRE>There was a glitch in the Sunday broadcast of In the Beginning.  They missed a
commercial break after the first act (as Lenonn goes to see Dukhat), and
inserted one in the middle of act 6.  That will be corrected in the next run,
so anyone who wants to get a copy of the movie with the right act breaks should
tape the next one.
