<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: B5 Under-budget?</H2>
9 Jan 1998<PRE>&gt;B5
&gt;seems to be alone in an place where most producers think that budgets
&gt;are made to be ignored.

On every season, and on every one of the TV movies, we have come in a bit under
budget.  Every time.  Not by skimping, really, but simply by planning properly.
 

See, I have this silly notion that if somebody gives you $21 million bucks or
so to make a series, it kinda behooves you to act responsibly.  

A little over $100 million will have passed through this company in making 5
years and 3 movies of B5...and every dollar has been accounted for, well spent,
and handled with sufficient responsibility that WB has gotten back its
underbudget on each season.  We have periodic audits, as with every production
company working with a studio, and they're gone within a few hours of arriving,
proclaiming our books the best they've ever seen.  

It's responsibility, a concept not often understood on this end of the coast.
