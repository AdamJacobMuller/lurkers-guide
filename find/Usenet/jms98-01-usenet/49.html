<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: "...Sky Full of Stars" (*SPOILERS FOR ALL SEASONS*)</H2>
16 Jan 1998<PRE>&gt;Joe, as I was watching "And the Sky Full of Stars" I was struck by
&gt;something that seemed like the hand of the Great Maker was involved (and
&gt;you did write the ep).  Specifically, I was struck by the three questions
&gt;Sinclair asked of the Grey Council during his abduction:
&gt;Who are you?"
&gt;
&gt;"What do you want?"
&gt;
&gt;"Why are you doing this?"

The first two definitely; the third is a bit of a stretch, though it may be my
subconscious is again being smarter than I was at the time.  Note also that the
"what do you want?" question is echoed over and over...as it would later be
echoed all over by Morden.  If you go back over the actual logic of how the
scene would have played, that bit only works if you allow for the
hallucination.  That was the hand of the author showing where, frankly, it
probably should not have showed.

&gt;P.S.  Is the (as you stated will be coming) *fourth* question located in
&gt;your Sierra reference guide?

Could be....
