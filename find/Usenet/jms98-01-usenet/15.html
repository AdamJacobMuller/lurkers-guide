5 Jan 1998<PRE>&gt;	I'm going to make this extremely brief; About how much has it
&gt;cost so far in production costs so far, not including promotions?

If "it" means the series, it's always been under $900 thousand per episode.  If
"it" means ItB, the production cost was just a tick under three million bucks.
