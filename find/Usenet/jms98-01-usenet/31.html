<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Writing Question</H2>
9 Jan 1998<PRE>&gt;That started me wondering -- just how much can you separate the
&gt;characters from the plot?  Maybe you have a character with the potential
&gt;to be just fascinating, but if you don't give him anything interesting
&gt;to do, how will your audience know?

People are fascinating by what they do or say, you can't have a character who's
fascinating but does nothing, so it's kind of a moot point.

But in general, plot proceeds from character...it's from defining who the
character is, what he wants, how far he's willing to go to get it, and how far
someone else will go to stop him.  From that comes all the rest.
