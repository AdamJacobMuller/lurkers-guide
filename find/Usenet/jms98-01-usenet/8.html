<H2>Re: JMS: sigs and baiting</H2>
3 Jan 1998<PRE>&gt;When I saw you and Claudia chatting live 
&gt;on AOL a few years ago, I read genuine respect and affection from both of 
&gt;you.  It couldn't have been as simple as just losing an employee, and it 
&gt;really burns my britches people haven't stopped to realize that you 
&gt;probably took a personal shot to the gut when she failed to sign.

Steve...you have no idea.

Thanks.  It needed saying.
