<H2>Re: Attn: JMS Season 5 Intro</H2>
18 Jan 1998<PRE>&gt;I was wondering though if the way the intro is done (and that is all I will
&gt;say to prevent spoilage)
&gt;is not your way of getting to those who said B5 wouldn't last 5 years.  
&gt;
&gt;

No, I dealt with that lot in 5 seconds of 422...no reason to give them any
further attention.
