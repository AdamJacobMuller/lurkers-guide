<H2>Re: Attn. JMS: Verse drama? WAS Room for Improvement - Kitchen?</H2>
17 Jan 1998<PRE>I've tried verse drama, even tried to do it with the new play I'm writing, then
finally had to abandon it...it's just hideously difficult and I find gets in
the way of my saying what it is that I want to say; I concentrate more on the
how than the what, the pattern rather than the content.  I guess my brain can
only work in one direction at a time.
