25 Jan 1998<PRE>&gt;Agreed.  It's almost as if they were doing a first episode for a new
&gt;series...almost, except that we know most of these characters and know
&gt;where they've been and what they've been through.

One note: due to the TNT ad blitz, we went into this on the assumption that we
were (and did) pick up a LOT of viewers who had never before seen B5.  These
folks would need to be brought up to speed on the returning characters and
situations, and the regular viewers would need to be brought up to speed on
Lochley...so I wrote it with that intention.
&gt;I personally liked Lochley a lot more than I thought I would.  Scoggins
&gt;really can act. &lt;g&gt;
&gt;
&gt;

Yup.
