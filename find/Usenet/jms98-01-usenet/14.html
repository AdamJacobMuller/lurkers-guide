5 Jan 1998<PRE>&gt;So Kosh recognizes that Sinclair is the same person he knew  1000 years in
&gt;the past as Valen; since Kosh didn't know that this wasn't really Sinclair
&gt;(else why greet him so?) wouldn't this have given Sinclair a dangerous
&gt;foreknowledge? 

Internal dialogue...what he was thinking, his reaction.
