<H2>Re: HEY JMS! Answer a couple of questions(****sanity**** warning)</H2>
9 Jan 1998<PRE>&gt;1. Have you finished writing the last three scripts for the 5th season?
&gt;
No.

&gt;2. Does Claudia Christensen have a guest shot anywhere in Season 5? 
&gt;
No, and who is Claudia Christensen?

&gt;3. What exactly is Thirdspace supposed to be about? No spoilers please
&gt;
Then don't ask.

&gt;4. Do you find me attractive? 
For what purpose?
&gt;4b. Do you need a poorly paid lackey to beat people up and clean your boots?
No.
&gt;4c. Can I be your friend? 
Not without you contravening the restraining order.

&gt;5. Well there be a security guard named Kenny who will die before the end of
every episode in season 5? 
No.
&gt;5b. If so can I play Kenny?
&gt;
Only if you will consent to being eaten by rats afterward.

&gt;6. Is your talent on loan from god like Rush Limbaugh's?
No, I get to keep mine.
&gt;6b. Can I have some of the enormous sums of cash you must have? 
What enormous sums of cash?  This ain't a real network, son.
&gt;
&gt;7. Shoes. What's the deal?
&gt;
They're supposed to make it harder for you to swallow your foot.

&gt;Now that I am done with my serious questions I have a few that I am
&gt;legally obligatted to ask under the terms of the 1988 Arms Reduction Act:
&gt;
&gt;Why?
Because.
&gt;Frog's Ass: watertight or simply waterproof?
What you do in the privacy of your home is your concern.
&gt;Wrestling: fake or pretend?
Kabuki Theater.
