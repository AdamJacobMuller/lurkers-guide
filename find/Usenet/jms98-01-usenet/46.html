15 Jan 1998<PRE>&gt;1. Who was the Minbari who was in Delenn's shower?

A member of the Grey Council, seen in later episodes.

&gt;2. And, why would his order be: "He must never know what happened. If
&gt;he should find out, he must be killed. Do you understand, Delenn?" 

Because if the word about the Sinclair/Valen/soul issue got out before their
people could be prepared, it could rip Minbari society apart...and since the
Minbari also believe in reincarnation, better to "recycle" Valen's soul than
see the world he cared so much about torn asunder.
