26 Jan 1998<PRE>&gt;When Garibaldi is walking into Lochley's new room, an
&gt;aide is hanging the symbol of the Earth Alliance on the wall.  Garibaldi
&gt;looks at it and states, "Hmmm.. it's a little crooked."   Somehow I
&gt;think that he meant more than how the symbol was hung on the wall.  Is
&gt;that a hint of things to come?

No, but it was certainly meant as a subtle double-entendre, given his recent
experiences.
