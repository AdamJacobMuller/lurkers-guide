<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Oscar Season perks</H2>
2 Jan 1998<PRE>&gt;I have noticed that studios routinely offer free entry to theaters for 
&gt;Academy and Guild members during award season.
&gt;Do you take advantage of the chance to see all your favorite flicks for 
&gt;free?  Or is it no big deal?

Who has time to see movies?
