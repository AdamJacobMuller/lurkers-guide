<H2>Re: Ratings for B5 first season; how do they compare?</H2>
23 Jan 1998<PRE>&gt;  However, I lack a frame of reference for
&gt;pre-prime time syndicated strips.  In particular, how is B5 doing
&gt;compared to Lois and Clark, especially how did Lois and Clark do last
&gt;month when it ran in B5's current time slot?

The daily ratings have been substantially higher in both number, and in the
demographics, which is crucial for advertisers who want to reach a specific
audience.  L&amp;C did about a 1.4 or 1.5 average, which they'd be happy if B5
reached or equaled.  The first 3 B5 eps of this week, for instance, all I have
so far for this week, were all 2.0...so TNT is delerious.
