25 Jan 1998<PRE>&gt;Urm, FOUR in a row being bad, actually -- I forgot In the Beginning.  The
&gt;last two episodes of season four were tripe, ItB was tripe, and NC was
&gt;tripe.

You forgot one very important phrase: "in my opinion."

Because there other opinions out there, and in the case of ItB you are
outnumbered around 99 to 1.  Just because you say it doesn't make it so.  

Because all-encompassing general comments based on one person's subjective
opinion is tripe...and surely you would not wish to commit tripe, woud you?
