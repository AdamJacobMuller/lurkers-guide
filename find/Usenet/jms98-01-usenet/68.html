25 Jan 1998<PRE>Excuse me, folks, but he was using a B5 starfury, which is programmed like all
starfuries there to sync up with the station's rotation for purposes of
docking, ejecting, and holding position for repair purposes.  All a pilot would
have to do is tell the on-board computer to sync up the thrusters with the
station's rotation, and it'd be done.

This is a no-brainer...which is why I didn't specify it in dialogue (also it
would've killed the drama of the momen).
