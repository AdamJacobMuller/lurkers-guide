<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: TVLNoLM Directing/Camera Shots (Spoilers)</H2>
29 Jan 1998<PRE>&gt;1) Was it just me THINKING that the lighting had changed or did it actually 
&gt;do so?
&gt;
We did the light change, and enhanced it further in post.

&gt;2) Was the scene shot with a steady cam mounted to someone or was
&gt;that some sort of boom (or was it the floating cameras that ISN uses)?

We attached the camera to his body.

&gt;3) Was the long single shot the idea of the director or was it spelled out
&gt;in the script by JMS?
&gt;
It was in the script.
