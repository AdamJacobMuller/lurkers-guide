<H2>Re: No Compromises. ( *Spoilers* )</H2>
23 Jan 1998<PRE>























&gt;&gt; I'm not sure exactly what it is about them...it just felt too contrived,
&gt;too
&gt;&gt; much the "gotta add the new plot device here".  Especially with Sheriden's
&gt;&gt; comment to Garibaldi along the lines of 'we both know there's going to be a
&gt;&gt; telepath war any day now.'  Huh?  Did they watch "Deconstruction"

This is hardly a new plot element...this has been brewing for 4 years now, with
the growing telepath underground.  As for the latter part of that comment...did
you already forget that in "Rising Star" there was a conversation between
Sheridan and Bester about the coming telepath war?  

Not my fault if you're not paying attention.

&gt;&gt; I would think that these guys would believe exactly the opposite, that the
&gt;&gt; peep/human conflict had been eliminated, since Edgars (the guy who planned
&gt;to
&gt;&gt; direct the war) was taken out of the picture.

No, Edgars wasn't trying to *start* a war, he was trying to solve it BEFORE it
started.  He knew it was coming, is coming, and was trying to give normals an
edge.  That edge is now gone.  Again, you're misinterpreting or misremembering
what's been established and saying it's an error on our part.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; *       Why did the telepaths need permission to come to Babylon 5?  I
&gt;though it
&gt;&gt; was open to anyone who could pay the rent.

Individually, yes...but again, pay attention, we're talking about a COLONY,
which means you've got several hundred people living in one area, under one
authority (Byron), with an unknown or unspecified agenda, whose presence might
bring problems from the Psi Corps and elsewhere.  So yeah, they're going to
need somebody's permission.  
&gt;&gt; *       Why did Sheriden promise a "hands-off" relationship (with
&gt;exceptions) in
&gt;&gt; regards to Lochley's responsibilities and powers, and then, in the very
&gt;same
&gt;&gt; episode, break that promise by finding an exception?  It seemed too
&gt;&gt; convenient, too pat.

He didn't break his promise...he moved this into a political decision, which is
his purview.  He said specifically, "If it's a political problem, or involves
the Alliance, it's my turf."  This is a strategic decision on behalf of the
Alliance.

&gt;&gt; *       Where the heck did this "image projection" power come from?  Can
&gt;Bester
&gt;&gt; (one of the most powerful peeps we know) do it?  If so, why has he not?  If
&gt;&gt; not, are these peeps more powerful than Bester?

Well, now you've got a contradiction.  Either we have seen this before, or we
haven't seen it before.  You say where did it come from, then cite an example
of where it's been seen before.  And if you'll go back and rewatch that
episode, you'll see that teeps can act collectively and be very strong.

&gt;It took an entire mob of
&gt;&gt; peeps, in "A Race Through Dark Places", led by the Ironheart-intensified
&gt;&gt; Talia and the rogue peep that Ironheart brought on board (previously seen
&gt;in
&gt;&gt; "Chrysalis") to project visions into Bester's head.  

No...again, you're distorting the situation.  The task wasn't just to send an
image into his head, it was to CONVINCE HIM that this image had really
happened, and it took a lot of them to do this to a Psi Cop.  That's why it
took so many of them; he's a strong target.  It ain't the same as doing it to a
normal.  You're not thinking through what you're saying.

&gt;Bester, a single
&gt;&gt; powerful peep, was able to manipulate Garibaldi's personality and integrity
&gt;&gt; in such a profound way that Garibaldi betrayed all his friends.  

No, he wasn't...they had to drug him, and do all kinds of work on him to make
that happen.  Again, you're in error.

&gt;Here we have
&gt;&gt; a whole colony of peeps with the ability to vanish, create a sound-vacuum,
&gt;&gt; and project visions.  And they need to ask permission to stay on the
&gt;station?
&gt;&gt; Why don't they just move in, set up shop, and turn silent and invisible as
&gt;&gt; necessary?

Maybe because they are (or are trying to be) the good guys?  Maybe because they
don't actually vanish, or turn off sound, they can individually manipulate
somebody by pressing on receptors and distorting things like their time
sense...but they're going to show up on cameras, and on sensors, and unless
they want to constantly try and control every single person on the station in
large groups as they pass by, they're going to be discovered, and booted off
the station.  So they may as well do the right thing and ask.  Just because
someone *can* steal doesn't mean they *should* steal.

Besides, where are they going to live?  Quarters have to be assigned, and
they're always short on space.  Food has to be paid for.  On and on.  Your
contention doesn't make sense...they're not gods.
