<H2>Re: Attn. JMS: Room for Improvement - Kitchen? Bedroom? Living Room?</H2>
16 Jan 1998<PRE>&gt;While you are obviously a *very* gifted professional writer, I'm sure
&gt;that there is still at least one area in which you're specifically,
&gt;consciously working to perfect your skill. I'm wondering what that area
&gt;(those areas?) is - what do you find the most difficult to do well
&gt;writing-wise? What tends to disappoint you the most about your writing?
&gt;And what are you doing to try and improve that area (those areas?) that
&gt;give you trouble?

There isn't any part of it that I think I've totally whipped...and I hope I
never do, because the moment you think you've got it all sussed, you've stopped
trying, and the work stultifies.

So there isn't really any one area, just a general sense that I have to
continue to get better...and the only way you get better is to keep trying new
things, in different combinations.
