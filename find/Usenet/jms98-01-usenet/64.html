23 Jan 1998<PRE>Folks...the opening credits are where we show the real names of the people
involved.  They're not part of the show per se.  We went into the central
docking bay to reveal the jms credit before; do we assume it's there?  It was
revealed in a Starfury flyby, was it there?  We always place it somewhere in
the shot.
