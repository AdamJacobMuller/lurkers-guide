<H2>Re: Attn JMS: Write how many episodes?</H2>
16 Jan 1998<PRE>&gt;&gt;* Do you know yet how many episodes you will write
&gt;&gt;in season 5?

Because a couple of freelance scripts didn't work out, it's come in at 21.

&gt;&gt;* To what number will your record-breaking string of
&gt;&gt;consequitively written episodes extend?

60

&gt;&gt;* Counting all five seasons, how many of the
&gt;&gt;110 episodes will you have written?

I think it's 91.  If you put all the episodes, the pilot, and the 3 movies
together, it's equal to 50 full-length feature films in 5 years.
