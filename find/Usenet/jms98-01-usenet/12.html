<H2>Re: ATTN JMS- REAL dumb question.</H2>
4 Jan 1998<PRE>&gt;So, I'm watching TNT's guide to B5 in the same room as my
&gt;parents, and when they mention the Centauri's 6 genitals, my mom asks
&gt;an all important question....  Which one do they use for urination?

That assumes the urinate out of the same organs they use for sex; ain't
necessarily the case.
