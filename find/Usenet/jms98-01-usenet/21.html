<H2>Re: Production Crew?</H2>
5 Jan 1998<PRE>&gt;You have freelance directors, freelance scriptwriters, freelance actors.. Are
&gt;there any "normal" crew associated with a production, and if so, under what
&gt;company do they fall?  (Babylonian Productions?)

Those (actors, writers, directors) are all above-the-line people.  The
below-the-line crew are all regular employees: camera operators and grips,
carpenters, costumers, others.  Most of the company consists of regular
employees, under BP.
