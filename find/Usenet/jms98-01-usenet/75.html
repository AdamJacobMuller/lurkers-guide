30 Jan 1998<PRE>Thank you for saying all of that; if we can be witnessses for hope, for the
possibility of joy and dignity, to one another, then there's a chance for *all*
of us.

And my sincerest condolences on your loss.  From your comments and
observations, I think she did a great job, and you should be proud.
