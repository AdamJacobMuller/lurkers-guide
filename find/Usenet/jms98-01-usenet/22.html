<H2>Re: In the Beginning ( *Spoilers* )</H2>
9 Jan 1998<PRE>&gt;&gt;&gt;  (But what happened to "No kids or cute robots"?)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I was wondering that, too.  It would have been
&gt;&gt;more like JMS to have Keepers on the kiddies'
&gt;&gt;backs.

Hello...is anyone there...?  I always said that in relation to SERIES REGULARS
AND RECURS.  Every time we have a kid on the show, and we've had several,
somebody throws this at me without once remembering that this applies to series
regulars/recurs, like Wesleys or the bots from Buck Rogers.  

And then somebody gigs me for something I didn't say.
