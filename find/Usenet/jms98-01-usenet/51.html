16 Jan 1998<PRE>&gt;It gave me goose bumps and made me feel wistful all
&gt;at the same time.  Excellent job, sir.

I have the same reaction to it...thanks.

&gt;BTW, so that's why we never saw the back of the station!  I must ask,
&gt;whose idea was that?  I thought it was hilarious.

I confess it was my idea...damn taggers are everywhere...it's my one indulgence
in 5 years.  Doesn't any good artist sign his work?
