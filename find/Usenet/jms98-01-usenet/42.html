<H2>Re: JMS: Best of Season 5?</H2>
13 Jan 1998<PRE>Actually, I say watch 'em all...usually each season we have one where you go,
"oh, well, it was a good effort."  This time, so far they're all solid; in many
ways, I think it's our best season to date.  There are a couple that will
doubtless split the fan reactions down the middle, as Deconstruction did, but
that's intended, just to keep folks from getting complacent...no, in general,
I'm pleased with them all.  

I'll leave it to the viewers to determine which of them is best.
