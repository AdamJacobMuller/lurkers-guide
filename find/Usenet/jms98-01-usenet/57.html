&gt;How much influence do you have when others write the occasional B5 episode?
&gt;I
&gt;am particularly curious about the Kosh scenes.  Do you write up a thorough
&gt;outlines and assign them out, or are the writers give the guidelines and told
&gt;to think something up?

Kosh often tended to get revised in-house to make him consistent, mysterious
rather than a fortune-cookie, which often happened.

Writers got variously verbal notes, a page or two, or in some cases, several
pages of notes/outline material on an episode.  But a script is very long, so
they had to come up with a lot to fill in the gaps.
