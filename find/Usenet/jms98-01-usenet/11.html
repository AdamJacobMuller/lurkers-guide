4 Jan 1998<PRE>Our first two seasons were roughly 40-50% freelance, which is a substantially
higher average than most shows.  Years 3 and 4 were mine, mainly because of the
difficulty in farming out stories in that situation.

Crusade will almost certainly to back to the 40-50% freelance mode, which is
frankly my preference, and it's been that way on all the previous shows I've
done.
