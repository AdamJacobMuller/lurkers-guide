<H2>Re: Cats:  Shadows or Vorlons?</H2>
29 Jan 1998<PRE>&gt;The setup:
&gt;
&gt;1.  One of our cats has decided that the cable box is a great place to
&gt;sleep.  It's warm, it's in a cozy spot.
&gt;
&gt;2.  We're taping B5.  We have choir rehearsals on Wednesday nights
&gt;(we're supplying our cantor with copies of seasons 1-3 as he didn't pick
&gt;up on B5 until late.
&gt;
&gt;3.  We get home, we get our snacks, we plop down to watch the episode.
&gt;
&gt;The payoff:
&gt;
&gt;We get approximately 10 minutes into "The Long Night..." and suddenly
&gt;we're watching a preschool thing.  I fast forward thinking it was a
&gt;problem with our cable company.  No--it switches a few minutes later to
&gt;some Charles Bronson movie.
&gt;
&gt;Now, I don't know if we're being made to pay for some transgression
&gt;(okay, we did throw him and the other felines into the garage while the
&gt;realtors were tramping through), but here's what he did:  he turned the
&gt;box on, switched channels twice, and turned in off!
&gt;
&gt;This is not normal feline intelligence.  You tell me, is this a Vorlon
&gt;or a Shadow we've got here?
&gt;
&gt;

Neither.  He's like all cats: he's a Keeper...they sit on your shoulder,
they're invisible unless they want to be seen, they glare at you out of one
baleful eye, and gradually they take over your life.
