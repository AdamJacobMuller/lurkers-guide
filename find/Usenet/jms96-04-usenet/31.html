<H2>Re: Question about JMS participation</H2>
4 Apr 1996<PRE>What I generally do when I log onto the group is look first for any
messages tagged ATT JMS; once I've run through those, I make my way
through the rest.  I tend to give first attention to main headers,
secondary to followup (RE:) messages, just for reasons of time.

So yes, the ATT still works, as long as it's used when appropriate.
