29 Apr 1996<PRE>The references given (he said vaguely, to avoid spoiling anybody) were
first and foremost intentional to the story and to set up stuff...but as I
wrote it, the way this stuff has been discussed online did come to mind,
and on some level it was probably a slight *plink*, yes.

Sort of a "yeah, well, TWO can play at that game, and most of you missed
THIS particular analogy, so THERE."

I am in serious need of a vacation, I think....
