<H2>Re: The best girlfriend in the world...</H2>
7 Apr 1996<PRE>"Severed Dreams had a line that was better than Ivanava's sex scene.  Wow,
do these women get lines!"

Can't help it.  I've always been vastly enamoured of strong, sharp, funny,
independent and strong-willed women.  (Well, me and 99% of the rest of the
male population, most of them just won't admit it.)

I love it when anyone -- male or female -- comes up with a killer line. 
Claudia and I are always going at it, each trying to top the other...and
I've found out the hard way that you don't challenge her on the theory
that she'll back down.  Won't happen.  Ivanova's just the same.  Mira is
also dedicated, fierce in her convictions, extremely bright and worldly.  

So why should their characters be any less than the women themselves?
