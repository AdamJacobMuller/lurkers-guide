<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Norman Corwin on NPR</H2>
4 Apr 1996<PRE>"Our NPR station in Chicago is planning on broadcasting "13 by Corwin,
a star-studded anthology of Norman Corwin's greatest radio plays."  
Any recommendations on particulars to watch for?"

Just sit back and enjoy a use of language like nothing you've ever heard
before.  You're in for a real treat.
