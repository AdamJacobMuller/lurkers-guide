20 Apr 1996<PRE>Me?  A tease?  Moi?  I just report the news, I don't make it.

The kiss is coming.  But I wanted to do it in such a way that it somewhat
unexpected, in a way that would have even more weight than under any other
possible conditions.  How do you turn a kiss into a wham?  (Aside from
kissing the right person, natch.)  Stay tuned....
