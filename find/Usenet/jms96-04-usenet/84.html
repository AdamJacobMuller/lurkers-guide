<H2>Re: ATTN JMS:Internet Influences</H2>
9 Apr 1996<PRE>"Just how much has reading the newgroups affected your writing style for
the show?  Do you think interacting with us on the Internet has been a
positive affect or could you have turned out B5 without us?"

My writing style is pretty much my writing style.  (Minus adjustments made
for the different ways characters talk on the show.)  

Yes, the interaction has been positive, in the sense that I get asked a
zillion questions about the show, the universe, the characters, their
history and the tech involved.  As a writer, it's your job to ask, and
then *answer*, every question conceivable about your story and characters.
 The more questions you've asked yourself, the better the job you can do.

Now, there's a finite number of questions one can ask oneself.  But on the
nets I get all KINDS of questions.  In answering those, I think about new
areas of the B5 universe, and the whole thing becomes stronger.
