<H2>Re: JMS: Larry DiTillio's initial reaction to the arc</H2>
5 Apr 1996<PRE>What Larry was responding to was the totality of the storyline, not so
much any one particular item.  If you stop for a moment and look back at
just how *much* has been covered just in these first two-and-a-half aired
seasons, you realize how far the story has come.  It's the whole of that
tapestry that is kinda boggling sometimes.
