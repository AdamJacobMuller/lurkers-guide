<H2>Re: Technical Gaffe? (**SD SPOILERS**)</H2>
4 Apr 1996<PRE>I figured that they'd come in through the outer hull, secure the inner
hull area, then go up in and through a side wall, which would be faster
for purposes of a mass entrance.  If you blow a hole in the floor,
everybody has to crawl out one at a time; you blow a hole in the wall,
bunches can come through at once.  There was a fair amount of distance
between where they came in, and the hull.
