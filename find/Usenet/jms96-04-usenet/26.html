4 Apr 1996<PRE>(* Spoilers for Point of No Return  *)


























Ok, at the end of this ep. Susan explains that 4 of the 5 cruisers with
Gen. 
Hague where distroyed. So did Earthforce get them or did Clark have the 
shadows do it?"


It was an ambush by Earthforce ships.  (Actually, only 3 were destroyed,
the other two took off separately, trying to throw off a united pursuit. 
But you know how ISN's been lately....)
