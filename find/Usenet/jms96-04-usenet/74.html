8 Apr 1996<PRE>"Do you find that music or sounds can have the same effect? Hear a line
from a song and lock into a moment in time? Remember not only the
visuals but the emotions of that moment?"

Absolutely.  I think everyone has that experience.  If you want to get
technical about it, it's probably a version of state-related learning.
