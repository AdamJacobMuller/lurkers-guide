<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Why five years?</H2>
30 Apr 1996<PRE>Knowing the syndication marketplace, I figured five was about the best you
could do before being canceled as new shows came in and the marketplace
changed.  At least, for a new show.  Six felt too long, four could be done
but I kinda wanted a little breathing room if at all possible.
