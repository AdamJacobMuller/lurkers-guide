9 Apr 1996<PRE>All the elements you point to are just tools that recur in any saga of any
size.  The dark forces, the one who turns, the source of ancient
wisdom...it goes back all the way to the Illiad and the Odyssey.  Compare
Kosh to the Oracle at Delphi and you'll have a pretty close match.

LoTR and B5 use the same tools, which have taken on different names over
the last 6,000 years.  That's all.
