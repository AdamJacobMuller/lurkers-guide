9 Apr 1996<PRE>"After any encounter like this, the sky around B5 is going to be littered
with debris, especially around the jumpgate, which falls neatly into the
"bad things" category for a station with such high traffic.  Who gets the
job of cleaning up?"


We've previously shown a hazmat platform that goes out into local space to
clear up debris and any toxic fuel cores and the like.  It's standard
operating practice.
