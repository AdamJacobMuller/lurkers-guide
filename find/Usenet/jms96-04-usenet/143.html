29 Apr 1996<PRE>It's down there...possible spoilers.
















You basically had two large convoys meeting one another.  Two Minbari
ships were hit and destroyed, a third damaged badly; this was the one
carrying Dukhat and the Grey Council, including Delenn.  

Just for the record, what happened after that...the Minbari ships opened
fire, and a number of the Earth ships were fragged.  The rest fled as the
Minbari ships hesitated, waiting to see what happened to Dukhat.  When it
was learned that he was killed, they took off and pursued the ships back
to an Earth base.  Initially, one of the Earth captains explained that
they had encountered hostiles (trying to cover his ass), and when the
Minbari ships appeared, all hell broke loose.

It was shortly after this "cowardly attack" on their ships, and the
assassination of their leader, that the Minbari declared what is in
essence a jihad, a holy war, against Earth.  The worker class went along
with it, even though the religious caste was unsure...but divided, they
couldn't raise sufficient objections to the war to stop it initially.
