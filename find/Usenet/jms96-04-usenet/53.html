7 Apr 1996<PRE>Because the story calls for it.  Whether they show the cliffhanger three
months or two weeks before the fourth season (assuming renewal), this is
where the story goes.  It was constructed like a series of novels, a
multi-volume saga, and like any good series of novels, you end on
something big.

And this year, season three ends on something really honking big.
