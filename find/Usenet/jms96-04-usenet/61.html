<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Question about Morden</H2>
7 Apr 1996<PRE>"Last year at the Chicago Comicon you mentioned that we'd be seeing more
about Morden, where he comes from and how he got where he is.  Is that
something that will be addressed this year or is that slated for farther
down the road?"

You'll learn a lot more about Mr. Morden by the end of this season.
