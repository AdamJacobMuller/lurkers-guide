<H2>Re: ATTN: JMS Books and TV Plot</H2>
26 Apr 1996<PRE>My theory is that *in general* the novels and comics tend to be canon, but
the details may not always be, mainly because it's virtually impossible to
ride herd on every single line of all this the way I do the show.  It
physically can't be done.  But where possible, we keep it as close to
cointinuity as possible.
