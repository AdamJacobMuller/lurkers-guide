<H2>request from jms</H2>
8 Apr 1996<PRE>Today I got online and found nearly 100 new email messages in my AOL mail
box.  Most of them were of two types: asking general questions that could
just as easily be asked in public forum, so that others could benefit from
the discussion, or copies of public replies also sent to me privately.

Please please please please *please* use the email address ONLY for
personal or confidential correspondence.  If my email gets flooded, I
won't be able to reply to anybody after a while via email, because I won't
be able to *find* anything.

Thankyew.
