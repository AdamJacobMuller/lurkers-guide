<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Borrowed Characters</H2>
26 Apr 1996<PRE>"I've noticed a few instances where the Star Trek progeny have borrowed
specific ideas from print SF with some changes to make story plots.  The
Dyson sphere and a ruined arms-dealer planet are specific examples and I
vaguely remember others.  I'd like to see some of the better SF characters
visiting B5 such as Slippery Jim DiGriz (alias Stainless Steel Rat) who
are never going to see the movie screen for technical reasons.  Can this
sort of thing be done?"

No, not here.  I generally consider that sort of thing to be too close to
the line bordering plagiarism for comfort.  Somebody went through a great
deal of work to create certain characters; I'd rather not poach on their
turf.
