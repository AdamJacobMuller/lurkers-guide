16 Apr 1996<PRE>Re: the hiring of Walter Koenig and Majel Barrett...in the former case,
this is a very talented actor, who is also a friend, and has never been
given the chance to showcase his real skills.  We provided that chance. 
In the case of Majel, she wanted to appear in the show to help eliminate
some of the division between B5 and ST fans.
