5 Apr 1996<PRE>"Is it me or do the Vorlons seem scared to fight the Shadows. Or anyone 
that they dont know they can win against. You have said in the past that 
the Vorlons are not enough to take on the Shadows so I assume you meant 
it in military terms. But I am sure with all the other races they could 
take on the Shadows. But they seem to be massing up forces so that they 
dont have to. I would guess they have never actaully fought the Shadows
yet"

To your later question...yes, in a sense, you're onto something, but
you're looking in the wrong direction.  But you're close.
