28 Apr 1996<PRE>No, we can't use any outside music; it all has to be done via our composer
(unless we purchase the rights, obviously).  Here, though, it's all Chris.
 We had a long conversation about the kind of music I wanted, I encouraged
him to think in terms of Celtic music, natural instruments primarily
instead of synth or electronic instruments, that sort of thing.  But no,
no Claanad was used.
