7 Apr 1996<PRE>Elayne:

"I *gasped* at this shot.  How was this done?  This was REALLY effective."




I'm always getting this confused in my own mind, but basically it's using
two contradictory moves with the camera.  You dolly in (push the camera
toward the object) and push out with the lens (or vice versa...that's the
part I'm forever getting confused about...like remembering battery
connections, is it positive to positive or positive to negative...?).  In
either event, you're basically going in and out/away at the same moment. 
It's a nifty effect.
