<H2>Spoiler Warning in VIR .avi/trailer</H2>
9 Apr 1996<PRE>Just an advisory...I finally saw the trailer for "Sic Transit Vir," and
I'd suggest anyone who wants to enjoy the show *not* watch the trailer, as
it gives away stuff that shouldn't be given away.

I.e., if the trailer for The Maltese Falcon said, "...and see the surprise
when the black bird is discovered to be an imitation."
