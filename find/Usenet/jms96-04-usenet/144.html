29 Apr 1996<PRE>Well, they're interesting speculations, and obviously I can't say one
thing or another about them at this time.

But on another level, you're right; if the clues are properly placed, and
the story proceeds in a logical, consistent fashion, about 20% of the
people will guess correctly on where it's going (this from my years on
Murder, She Wrote).
