<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Is Ikara 7 connected to the last Shadow War?</H2>
19 Apr 1996<PRE>There is a connection between the Ikarran situation and the shadows, but
only a tenuous one.  They had heard of the great enemy rampaging all over
the place, and had cobbled together a very primitive source of organic
technology that would kill anything and anyone that was not pure Ikarran
(which, of course, led to their destruction).  Sinclair, at the time, hit
it dead on..."When you become obsessed with the enemy, you *become* the
enemy."
