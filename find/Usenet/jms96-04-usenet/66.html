7 Apr 1996<PRE>"I cannot imagine what it takes to track all of the pieces and snippets
filmed out of order!  This is a fascinating glimpse into what goes on
making a show..."


Cindy: that's why a producer must be a good multitasker.  You've got to
keep not just the one episode in your head, but more.  For instance,
dailies from the day's shooting before come in, for 5 scenes that are out
of sequence, and you have to be able to look at them, knowing what was
shot before in your head, and know intuitively if it's going to match. 
Then a CGI 8-second shot for another episode comes in, and you have to
know how it'll match up with the live action which is still being
edited...and the director has a question about scene 28 in the next
episode to be shot...the editor wants to know if you meant what you said
about reversing scenes 34 and 35 in last week's episode....

It can make you totally and completely nuts.

At that point, it's all Darwinian producing: evolve or die.
