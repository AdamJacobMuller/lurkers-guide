20 Apr 1996<PRE>Probably the one person who's had to know the most of what's coming is
Peter Jurasik, because we've had to flash forward to his future the most
of anyone, and he kinda needed to know what it meant and how he got there
in order to play it properly.  After that...probably Mira, then Sheridan. 
The rest are on a need to know basis.
