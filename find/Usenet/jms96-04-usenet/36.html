<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Cast members and writing/directing</H2>
5 Apr 1996<PRE>Insofar as I know, only Stephen Furst has any directorial background (and
he's quite good at what he does).  So far, none of the cast has made any
real noise about directing.  Frankly, I'd like to make sure it doesn't
come up, because if one cast member directs, then logically and
reasonably, you find yourself in a situation where you can't deny anybody
else.  Then they're *all* directing, and the acting slips.  Most of the
cast don't seem terribly interested in the notion anyway, so with luck
it'll be a moot point.
