<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Making episode script(s) available?</H2>
19 Apr 1996<PRE>This is something we've discussed doing, and may indeed do at some point. 
In the interim, the tentative plan is to have the script for "The Coming
of Shadows" included in the new edition of my writing book, due out in the
fall.  

What would make all of this even more interesting is the fact that *every
single script* has at least something that's been trimmed out of it;
sometimes just a few lines, sometimes a couple of small, expendable
scenes.
