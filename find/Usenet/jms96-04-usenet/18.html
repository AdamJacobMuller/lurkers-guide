<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Question About Writing of Seasons 4 &amp; 5</H2>
4 Apr 1996<PRE>I haven't actually broken down how I'm going to do this next year, in
terms of what to assign and what to do in house.  I'll have a somewhat
better idea once I sit down with the outline, break out the various parts
of it for the period in question, see what I want to throw out or keep
from that based on things that I've modified this season or changed my
mind about....

At that point I'll have a solid notion of the stand-alones that can be
farmed out.  At this juncture, having just finished writing all 22 this
year, and almost finished with production, I'm still catching my breath. 
Check back with me on this closer to late May or early June.
