<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Music and ComiCon</H2>
19 Apr 1996<PRE>Yes, I am planning for now to attend San Diego ComicCon; it's my one big
chance to go nuts buying Cool Stuph (tm) every year.

As for the music I listen to...that just got hashed over on CIS, and
reposted here, so I'm loathe to go into it all again.  The short version
is that I listen to just about anything and everything except hardass
Country/Western, which I just can't get into.  I couldn't warm up to Garth
Brooks if we were cremated together.  Not to say it's bad, only that it
doesn't work for me.

In general terms, the music I listen to while I work tends to be of the
harder, more driving or intricate sort; if it's too soft, I fall asleep
and tip over in my chair, making an awful clatter as I hit the deck.
