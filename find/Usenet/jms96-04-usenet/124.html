23 Apr 1996<PRE>The foreign mailings were initially going to be ground; we're
investigating whether or not we can afford, without raising the price, to
do airmail instead.

We're taking other steps to see if we can make things easier for the UK
fans.

As for where I am, I'm still kinda all over the place, here, CIS, GEnie,
AOL primarily.
