23 Apr 1996<PRE>Usually, you get big cuts in shows going from network to cable because the
restrictions on the number of commercials are greater for the former than
the latter.  However, the number of spots in syndication are about the
same as for cable, so there shouldn't be any need for cuts.  Also, once
the show hits TNT, you won't be using the Kung Fu (certainly) or B5
(probably) promos anymore, which frees up another 30-45 seconds for
commercials.

So overall, I shouldn't think there'd be much need for editing.
