7 Apr 1996<PRE>This is very odd.  I did reply to it.  Guess the AOL system ate it.

Trying again...
















If B5 was a dream given form, and the EA had the potential to be something
more than it has become, and the two part ways, then you have severed
dreams.  (I had a much more elegant and interesting reply, but obviously
it entered Vorlon space and hasn't been allowed out again.)
