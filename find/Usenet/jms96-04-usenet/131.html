<H2>from jms: to support B5</H2>
25 Apr 1996<PRE>I've noted, and been sent, a number of messages asking how folks can best
support or coordinate support for B5 among the stations, which are the key
to keeping the show going and healthy.

Just in the last few weeks, Warner Bros. has set up a web page designed
specifically to assist in this area, noting the fan interest in aiding the
show.  It contains email and snail mail addresses and phone numbers and
contact names for all the stations now carrying B5, broken down by state
and city, with suggestions on letters, and a new gif and jpg image of the
revised B5 symbol (sword and B5 logo) which can be put on other web pages
to link them in.

As has been noted, WB wants to continue the show, and the key right now
are the stations which are being pressured to limit time to other shows in
deference to UPN, Fox and others.  (Lonseome Dove, for instance, was just
canceled, even though it was getting good ratings, because the producers
just couldn't find enough stations to make it worth it for the national
advertisers.)  

So if you're looking to coordinate B5 support, I commend to you this web
page:
