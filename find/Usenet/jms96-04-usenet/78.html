<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Haig, Talia contracts? (spoilers for Severed Dreams)</H2>
9 Apr 1996<PRE>"I'm tired of getting used to characters only to have the actors leave the
show.  Can't you get better contracts with these actors?"

Regarding Talia...our contract was ironclad.  If we had wanted the
character to continue, it would have.  

Regarding Hague...it's much harder to hold an actor on a once-in-a-while
basis.  Every show is hostage to that.  It's a reality of life.  We don't
have contracts with folks who play one or two parts a year.  Screen Actors
Guild doesn't allow that; you make deals as they come up.  You can't stop
an actor if he wants to jump ship under those conditions; and if you try,
you have an unhappy actor on your set who'll just walk through it because
he or she doesn't want to be there.
