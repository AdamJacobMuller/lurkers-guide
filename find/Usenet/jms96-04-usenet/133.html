<H2>Re: ATTN Moderators, JMS, Everyone: A Proposal for all of the many questions to JMS</H2>
26 Apr 1996<PRE>Good hearted an idea as it might be, I'm not sure it's necessary.  Now, if
it's a question we've seen a thousand times before, and I've answered lots
of times before, if anybody wants to kick in with that answer, that's
fine, but overall....

I guess part of this is that very often the ATT JMS notes aren't really
questions, or advance a particular thought that doesn't seem to lead to a
response.  When a very specific question is asked, about writing or the
show or the like, then I tend to answer.  If someone uses ATT JMS and
says, as is often said, "I was thinking that the Minbari are an advanced
species, and maybe because of this they don't have the same approach to
justice we do, so we shouldn't judge them," my usual reaction is to nod
and move on, because they've expressed their opinion, and there really
isn't much I can add to that...it's their feeling about something.

As opposed to, "What, historically, have the Minbari done about the
question of justice?" which leads to a discusssion.  To some extent, like
any conversation, the quality of the answers you get depends on the
quality and specificity of the questions asked.

Also, right now, since we're not shooting, in a way during the hiatus
period I become something of a balloon sans air.  There isn't that much
interesting to talk about at this end, we're not doing anything but post
production; the sets are all dark, awaiting word.  And, finally, I do tend
to get somewhat quiet each season while we wait for word on renewal.  This
brief period between April and renewal are really my own down-times on the
show...and I'm kinda like Marcus, if I don't have something to say, I
generally don't say anything rather than waste people's time filling up
space.
