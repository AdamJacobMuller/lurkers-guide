<H2>Re: Three Ages of Mankind -- Speculation</H2>
3 Apr 1996<PRE>No, this isn't it.  What I'll say is that the issue is more philosophical
than technological in nature.  But you won't be able to figure the third
age yet because you don't have all the information you need to make that
determination.  After the end of this season, you'll have most of it,
however.
