26 Apr 1996<PRE>I agree, I think Chris did a great job on this one (he's done some
spectacular work overall this season, on Severed, Interludes, Ship and
others later this season).  What I'd told him in this case I wanted was as
much as possible in the way of natural instruments as opposed to synth, so
that it fit more with the feel of the episode.
