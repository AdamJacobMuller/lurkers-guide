18 Apr 1996<PRE>"what is your experience with role playing games and how has it affected
your writing?"

I've actually taken part in at most two RPGs in my time, and while they
were interesting, I don't think I'm overmuch interested in doing them
again, nor did I walk away from the table with anything more than, "Well,
that was fun, sorta."
