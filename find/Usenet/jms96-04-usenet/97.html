<H2>from jms: I'm here, sorta</H2>
17 Apr 1996<PRE>To all who've inquired...I'm here, just not as much lately.  I was out of
town and offline from Friday through Sunday, and returned to Harlan's
situation.  We've been doing all we can to help at this end, and things
are looking good now in that regard, but it's taken time and concern, on
top of still being a bit swamped with post production, and there are a LOT
of messages here to catch up on, which can be a bit daunting.

Give me a bit of time to catch my breath, clear the decks and otherwise
get stuff in order, and I'll be able to catch up here a bit.
