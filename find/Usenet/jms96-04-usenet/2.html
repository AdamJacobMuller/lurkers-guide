Thanks, glad to be here. 

"...second I would like to know if it is true WSBK Boston has decided to
drop B5."

I don't actually know.  I heard this on the nets, but so far even WB
hasn't been apprised of anything about this.  (We called them as soon as
we heard, and it was news to them.)  I know it was posted during a flurry
of April Fool's jokes, but I don't know for sure if it was that or
something else.  We're looking into it, though, and as soon as we know, or
if anyone hears anything else, we'll go into it.
