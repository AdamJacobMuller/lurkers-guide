"What are all those StarFuries *for*?  What do they do in a big
battle, other than fill up the screen with cool action?

Every battle I can recall (I've seen every ep except B^2; but I 
have a life and haven't watched them all many times, so I could
misremember something) has had a lot of StarFuries flitting
around and shooting at each other, and occasionally getting caught
in the crossfire of the Big Guys who are also shooting at each
other.  

The issue is, however, finally decided by the Big Guys, one of 
which invariably blows the other up (or chases it off or whatever).

"The battle scenes in SEVERED DREAMS are perfect examples.  Opening
sequence -- Bunch of StarFuries flitting around; eventually one
Big Guy's main battery punches out the other one.  Defense of B5:
same basic concept; one Big Guy is torn to crap by another, while
the other two go down in a rammerjammer suicide run.

So whatinole were alla them StarFuries even out there for?"


A lot more ships came in with the Roanoke and the Agrippa, support ships
and others.  Probably more breaching pods.  They took out those.  They're
also used to keep the enemy starfuries from disabling the defense grid on
the station, leaving B5 free to use its weapons on the larger target/worse
threat.  They're often used to soften up the enemy, harrass them like a
pack of hounds falling on a prey.  In "Fall of Night," we saw a Centauri
vessel in large measure taken out by the Starfuries with some B5 support. 
So they definitely play a part.
