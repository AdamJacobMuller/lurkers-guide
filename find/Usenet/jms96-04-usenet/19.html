<H2>Re: ATTN: JMS, Claudia Christian on Sci-Fi Buzz.</H2>
4 Apr 1996<PRE>"Last week's episode of Sci-Fi Buzz featured an interview with Claudia
Christian. During the interview, they showed clips from an episode
being filmed. Would you please tell me the name (or number) of that
episode?"

I believe, from what I saw, that it was a piece from "Grey 17 Is Missing."
