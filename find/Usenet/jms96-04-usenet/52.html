7 Apr 1996<PRE>To be quite objective about it, from my admittedly subjective opinion
(have I qualified this answer enough?), there's much to commend
Hypernauts.  It's a show worth checking out.

For my money, however, I have to say that pound for pound, character for
character, I tend to *prefer* "Space Cases," because it's just a hoot to
watch.  A lot of fun.
