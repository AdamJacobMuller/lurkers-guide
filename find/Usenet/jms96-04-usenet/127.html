<H2>Re: Attn JMS: Airing Dates</H2>
24 Apr 1996<PRE>Start with a correction: the final 4 from last season aired in October,
not November.  That aside...

No, it didn't take that long to finish the CGI, since they'd already aired
months before in Britain.  We will have all the CG and incidental stuff
finished for S3 in July, in time for the August UK airings of the last
batch of episodes.  But PTEN sometimes holds back a handful of episodes to
put on prior to the new season to help ramp up the ratings and get a
running start.
