<H2>Re: Forces of light?  (SPOILERS up to "Interludes")</H2>
29 Apr 1996<PRE>Just to be sure on spoilers....





























"In other words, it seems like our heroes have been more or less sitting
on their thumbs, embroiled in internal problems, waiting for the war to
start.  Next week, I suspect they'll start to pay the price."

The former part of this is not entirely true.  Some stuff has been going
on in the background, but it's been very secretive...which is why you
don't know about it yet.  They've been working like the dickens, getting
some stuff ready...and you'll find out what that is in an episode later
this season.  They needed to buy time, and now that they've had it,
they've used it well.
