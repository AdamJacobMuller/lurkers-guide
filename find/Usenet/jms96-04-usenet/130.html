25 Apr 1996<PRE>Well, there's what one would *prefer*, and there's that which is
*sensible*.  And the sensible answer is that no, once the last S3 episode
airs in the UK, there's no way on earth you're gonna keep that out of the
public eye, and there ain't much sense to protecting it or hitting it with
spoiler regs.  I'd let it go at that point.  

(And, frankly, it'll probably slip out some time before that; when it
hits, it hits, I've decided to let it go at that point...you just ain't
gonna hear it from ME, that's all.)
