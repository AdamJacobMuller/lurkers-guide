22 Apr 1996<PRE>No, when Londo goes to Delenn earlier this season to ask about having Vir
appointed to the Centauri diplomatic mission, he mentions then that the
mission has been closed for some time, "some trouble I believe with our
previous liaison."  This just paid that off; those Minbari are just a
darned bad influence, I guess.
