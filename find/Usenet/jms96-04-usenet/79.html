9 Apr 1996<PRE>The process is quite a bit more elaborate than that, hence the cost.  You
have to back to the original negative stock and re-develop every frame of
film print to the proper perspective, then adjust all the CGI to match.

However, this is being done already, with France preparing to show season
3 in the widescreen version.  It just takes a while, and it costs.
