21 Apr 1996<PRE>Yes, I read the Foundation books, but it was a while ago; it *could* be
done for TV, but it'd be tremendously difficult and hideously expensive
from a production standpoint.  For now, anyway.  In, say, another 10-15
years, with more changes in the technology of television, it might be more
feasible.
