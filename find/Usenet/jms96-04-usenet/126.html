<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Means of Foreign Payment for Fan Club</H2>
23 Apr 1996<PRE>We just had a meeting today about the fan club, and in response to some of
the questions here about the UK, we're investigating how best to handle
this to make it easier for folks outside the US to get involved.  We hope
to have some answers soonish, so UKers might want to wait just a bit
before sending in their subs.
