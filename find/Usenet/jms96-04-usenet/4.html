<H2>Re: JMS: Video releases</H2>
3 Apr 1996<PRE>We're still going back and forth on the video releasing question; there's
movement to do it ourselves, but if we go that route, it means doing only
limited editions since we can't handle huge orders; then there's some
movement on the notion of another video company licensing it from WB,
which means that more can be produced, probably at less cost to people
than a limited edition.  (Which is good.)  So we're still sussing all this
out.

The only problem with putting 3 or 6 episodes on a tape means either
taping at a slower speed, which means a drop in quality, or a larger tape,
which also raises the price and runs into the peril of more tape jams.  

BTW, we recently found out that for sure France is getting the widescreen
versions of the show starting this season, so we're looking into the
notion that whoever does the tapes will use those versions.  But this is
still preliminary.
