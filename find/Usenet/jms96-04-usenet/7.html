<H2>Re: JMS: Series Artistic Design?</H2>
4 Apr 1996<PRE>The way it usually works is this: when I write something new into the
show, a new alien race, a new costume, or a ship, the person who handles
that department comes to see me when the script is published.  They ask
what I had in mind.  I describe what I need it to do, or if I saw it
clearly in my head what it looked like. 

The person then goes away and comes back with sketches.  Sometimes it's
just one, sometimes a number.  If the latter, I go through the sketches
and pick the one that matches most with what I envisioned.  In either
case, I'll make whatever suggestions seems appropriate and not too stupid.
 Sometimes I'll modify the drawing myself, even though I can't draw for
sour owl poop.

When our original prosthetic designers on the pilot couldn't figure out
what to do with the Minbari crest, I went down to the place and literally
helped sculpt the original bone piece; I gave John Iacovelli a rough
sketch of the layout of the White Star; modified costume designs and other
stuff on Kosh and other characters.  That sort of thing.

Having said that, however, I have to emphasize that in the long haul, I
have to do very little in the way of course correction or revision.  Once
we discuss it, the folks around here know their craft, and the show, well
enough to hit it virtually every time.  And I try to leave plenty of room
creatively for them to play and have fun with it.  Usually the approval
process amounts to little more than "Yup, looks good to me."
