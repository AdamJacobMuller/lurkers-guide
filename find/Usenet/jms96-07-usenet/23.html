30 Jul 1996<PRE>"Do you have directors lined up for the first few episodes of the fourth
season yet?"

Mike Vejar is going to do a bunch, we've got Jesus Trevino, David Eagle,
and are currently setting up some new directors on the show.

"Also, do the directors for B5 have contracts that they will direct X
number of episodes in a season, or are they on a verbal agreement type of
thing, or is it something else?"

It's never verbal, that's too easy to abuse on either side.  It's all done
via deal memo, usually one or two at a time, or if we know the director
well, for several at once.
