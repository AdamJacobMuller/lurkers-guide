<H2>Re: B5 slips under Time Magazine radar</H2>
7 Jul 1996<PRE>"I find it interesting that the article talks about SF's "comeback" where
I really didn't see it diminish (at least in the last decade or so)"

Here's what happens, having been part of a whole lot of these articles
over the years:several new SF shows come along.  You get called for
interviews about this sudden explosion of SF.  Six months go by.  The
shows disappear.  And now you get calls for interviews about why SF
doesn't seem to work on TV.
