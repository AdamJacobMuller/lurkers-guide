19 Jul 1996<PRE>"More concretely, however -- any chance of Babylonian Productions doing a
series of workshops (directing, acting, SFX, costuming -- I know *you*
couldn't do writing, because of the story idea thing) at a convention? Or
*as* a convention?"

This is only something we've discussed in relation to a convention.  If we
were to put on a B5 convention, via the fan club, one of the things we'd
do would be to make it an informative experience.  Each of our
departements -- makeup, costume, EFX, others -- would give presentations
to folks interested in those areas (you could probably pick 2 or 3), so
you'd have something a bit more than the usual, "Okay, I'm on stage, what
do you want to talk about?"  Again, the goal is to help folks understand
how this TeeVee critter works.
