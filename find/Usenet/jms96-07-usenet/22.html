<H2>Re: Attn JMS: fan club problems</H2>
29 Jul 1996<PRE>Karen: we recently found that the post office sent back whole *packages*
of the fan club material to us, which they held onto for almost two
months.  We used two different post offices for the mail drops; we used
the same amount of money for the mailing on all the mail drops, what the
first one told us it should be, and that was fine...the second decided it
should be more, never told us, and just sent the stuff back after a while.

There've been similar problems with the mailings, though many people are
now getting their stuff.  Jim's been flooded with messages -- he showed me
a stack two inches thick -- and he's processing them as fast as he can. 
Better to solve the hassle and get them out again than answer each one of
the emails.  

This is a new venture, remember, there's some shakedown time.  Jim's
dancing as fast as he can.  You'll either get a reply or a packet soon.
