<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Concerns about "Shadow Dancing"?</H2>
24 Jul 1996<PRE>"You've mentioned a couple times that the upcoming "Shadow Dancing" will
be 
quite violent.  Should I be concerned about, say, my two-year old watching
it? 
She's as hooked on the show as I am, and would probably feel quite left
out..."

This is a tough one...I've given it a lot of thought since I saw this, and
my sense is to advise the following:

If you possibly can, videotape the episode.  Get the time code on the
various pieces.  We cut in and out of two stories, an A and a B story. 
One is violent, the other is not.  You don't have to see the one, or see
much of it, to follow the other.  For someone as young as 2, I'd suggest
fast-forwarding past the B story stuff.  It's still within what's
generally permitted on TV, but it is kinda harsh.
