<H2>Re: ATTN: JMS: Position on Captain Power?</H2>
1 Jul 1996<PRE>I was the story editor on Captain Power.  The show was created by Gary
Goddard, not by me.  I was brought in to basically run the story part of
it once he had sold it.  In that capacity, I was more or less left alone,
and could do what I wanted (though the first episode has a lot of Gary's
fingerprints all over it).  Some of what we did there was pretty good; in
other cases, I wouldn't mind if the negatives fell off a pier somewhere
and were never seen again by humankind.
