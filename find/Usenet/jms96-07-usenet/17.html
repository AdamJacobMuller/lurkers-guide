<H2>Re: ATTN:JMS Redemption</H2>
22 Jul 1996<PRE>Thanks.  From where I sit, you can't just play the damnation card in
drama; you have to also play the redemption aspect.  When you look at the
early Twilight Zones for instance, you see redemption there as much a key
issue as a Bad Guy getting what's coming to him.
