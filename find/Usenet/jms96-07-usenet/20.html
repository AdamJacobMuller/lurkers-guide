<H2>Re: JMS: Question, "Hour of the Wolf"</H2>
28 Jul 1996<PRE>"Have you ever contemplated doing an episode of B5 that unfolds in real
time (i.e. one minute of screen time is one minute of plot time, as done
in the movies "Miracle Mile" and "Nick of Time"), or would that be
counterproductive to the sorts of stories you're trying to tell?"

Actually, yeah, I have considered doing that...it can be a very limiting
structure, and the story has to be just right for it to work.  Haven't
quite worked out all the snags yet.

"Or is "Hour of the Wolf" a story of that particular variety?"

Nope.
