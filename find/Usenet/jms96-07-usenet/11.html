<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Directing B5?</H2>
19 Jul 1996<PRE>"Specifically: in an ep like "Severed Dreams" where cgi effects take up
literally almost 1/4 of the script, how much input does the director have
on "camera" angles, close ups of 'Fury pilots, and the way in which the
SFX is intercut with live action?  Or is that entirely your job?"

Generally, a lot of that material is either storyboarded, or supervised by
our on set EFX supervisor, who determines the angles to be used.  This is
especially important in an episode like Severed Dreams when you have to
make sure that the pilots are oriented the right way on camera (i.e.,
going from left to right, and facing left to right) if that's the
direction their ships are going in; otherwise you'd have to flop the film
to make it match.  In larger set pieces, using virtual sets and composite
shots, the director has more influence.

"Also: when dealing with an ep with a lot of flashbacks or reused footage
(WWE, especially part 2), how much freedom does the director have?  Does
he/she have to match the style of the previously show footage (in terms of
angles, close ups, pacing, etc), or is there more room for the director's
own style?"

In the case of WWE, you had to match lighting and composition pretty
closely.  That's about the only time it's really become an issue.

"(one more question: if someone other than you had written "Babylon
Squared", would they have to be paid royalties for the reuse of parts of
that episodes script and footage in "War Without End"?)"

Anyone who writes a scene which is reused gets residuals.  Doesn't matter
if it's me or anybody else, as a Writers Guild member, it's guaranteed and
required.  Also the actors, the director, and others get re-use fees of
varying amounts depending on how long the sequence is.
