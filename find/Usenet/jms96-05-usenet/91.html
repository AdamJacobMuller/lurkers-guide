31 May 1996<PRE>Okay, I dug out the demographics report that just came in for 2nd quarter
1996.  This will eventually be broken down into smaller and smaller groups
now that the quarter is done, so you can know how subset groups are doing,
but that won't be along for a while now, and won't contradict anything
here.  (I'm very eager for the subset breakdown...should prove most
enlightening.  The demos only break down the 18-49 age range as that's the
most fiscally important.)

Anyway, here's the breakdown for the second quarter in the 18-49 age
range, the most sought after group for advertisers, for men, women, and
both.  The higher the number, the better your coverage within that group;
1000 is nearly impossible to get.  Warners is *extremely* pleased by this;
it's the first time we've had the best demographics of all dramatic
series.
