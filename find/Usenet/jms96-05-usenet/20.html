<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Use of Social Psych in Writing B5</H2>
10 May 1996<PRE>There's a little of lots of things in the writing, it's hard to pin down
any one of them; I don't sit down and say, "Okay, now to use some
psychology on this."  A writer is like a sponge; you pick up lots of
colors and strangenesses, then when you come to write something, you
squeeze, and everything comes out together.  I write what the dark and
scary parts of my brain seem interested in writing about.
