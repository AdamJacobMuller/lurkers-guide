<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: you mean twisted genius! (spoilers for WWE 2)=</H2>
23 May 1996<PRE>Thanks.  As I wrote the episodes prior to WWE2, I kept leading up to that
first kiss, over and over, but deliberately never quite getting there.  I
knew that when it came time to do it, I wanted to do it in just the way
you describe...it would and wouldn't be a first kiss, both at exactly the
same time.  So there's the moment everyone's been waiting for, but not in
quite the way anyone had expected.
