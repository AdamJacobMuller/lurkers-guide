19 May 1996<PRE>That's a great article, could you possibly send along a copy? Thanks.

As for the one-hour special...it's something we broached to WB. 
Unfortunately, unlike Fox, which can program whatever it likes, we're a
syndicated show, and the only way to get a 1-hour special is to sell the
hour to every station individually, and apparently that's a huge pain in
the ass.
