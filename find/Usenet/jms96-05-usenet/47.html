14 May 1996<PRE>"Where does the run sequence then come from?  How much does the decisions
on how the Bs run in and out, affect how you sequence the As?  Some of
your Bs get to be major elements down the line, so how aware are you of
this when you're selecting&gt;  Do you end up getting there and looking back
and *then* realising where you were going, and deliberatly weaving from
then on - or have you always been aware of when weft turned warp?"

Where does dance come from?  Where does music come from?  Where does
making love come from?  How do you instinctively know what to do?

Beats the hell out of me.  I just listen to the music....
