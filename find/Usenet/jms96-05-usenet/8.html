<H2>Re: Last 5 season 3 episodes will be held back.  WHY?</H2>
6 May 1996<PRE>I don't yet know the full story, I just came into this info this weekend,
having been away at a convention, and will try to verify it this week.  

The bad part of this, if what I've read is correct, is that you've got 4
months of reruns, June-September.  But *most* shows are in reruns at that
time, especially syndicated shows.  You've only got 22 episodes per year,
that means you're going to have reruns 30 weeks out of the year.  

The reason Warners held back 4 episodes last time for October was so that
they could help ramp up the ratings in the November sweeps.  If they're
doing the same thing here, on the up side, that would at least seem to
indicate some optimism about renewal, otherwise what would be the point in
burning them up in a non-sweeps period (like October)?
