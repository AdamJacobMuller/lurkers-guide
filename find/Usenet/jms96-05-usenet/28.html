<H2>Re: ATTN: JMS HOUR 25/SF lovers read</H2>
12 May 1996<PRE>Hour 25, when I hosted it, was a pretty eclectic mix of stuff.  We covered
hard SF, fantasy, horror, comics, TV, movies, you name it; we/I
interviewed writers, directors, producers, directors, artists, the whole
gamut.  Neil Gaiman, Walter Koenig, John Carpenter, Bill Gibson, Jonathan
Carroll, Clive Barker, Ray Bradbury, Tim Powers...if they were involved in
speculative fiction in any of its forms, sooner or later they came to Hour
25.  (Hmm...why, there's a slogan in there...)

The first half-hour was mainly nattering, news of the SF world, local and
national, nominations of various sorts, who was in town, some brief
reviews, personal anecdotes...nattering.  The next hour was spent in heavy
interview mode; the last half hour or so we opened up the phone lines for
questions from listeners.

The same format is being used in the current incarnation, with some
modifications: more shorter pieces rather than in-depth single person
interviews, more canned interviews, more software and space program info,
that sort of thing.  The personality of the individual host tends to shape
the show.
