15 May 1996<PRE>"Hi there, I am writing on behalf of my friend who is a massive B5 fan.
He is always talking about it and actually seems to live it. His E-Mail
address
is ssbamab@cr47c.staffs.ac.uk
How can he become an official ranger and get the Isil'zha badge ?"

Oh, that's easy.  First he has to get to Minbar.  Once he does that, just
let me know and I'll take care of the rest.
