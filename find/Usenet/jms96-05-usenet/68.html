No, both Sheridan and Delenn *are* made up older.  If you particularly
look at Delenn out in the light of later scenes in WWE2, you can
DEFINITELY see the difference.  With Sheridan, it's a greying of the hair,
and some lining on the face.  Londo, though, if you recall, is much older
than Sheridan to begin with.
