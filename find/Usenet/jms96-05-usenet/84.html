26 May 1996<PRE>You must understand that this is a loop.

The stations often tend to reply with, "We'll continue to air the show as
long as WB makes it."  What's key to WB airing the show, however, is the
number of stations that agree to air it, preferably with double runs,
because that's where WB makes its money with the national advertisers.  If
WB were to lose X-number of stations, it wouldn't be profitable for them,
and thus they wouldn't continue to make it, thus the stations that *did*
want it couldn't buy it.

Compared to this, the chicken/egg equation was easy.
