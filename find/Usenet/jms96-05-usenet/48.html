<H2>Re: Production Process (was Return of the Newsgroup Timekillers)</H2>
14 May 1996<PRE>"I was wondering how much time it takes to cast the guest spots and get
them properly costumed.  It would appear to be a logistical nightmare to
try and come up with a design much less fit a costume for a character when
you don't know what actor will be hired.  Have you ever had problems
getting access to the actor for fitting (say they were working on some
other project or something)."

Usually, if it's an elaborate costume, it's already in the works when we
begin the casting process.  It's very rare when we get a part that calls
for someone of an unusual somatotype (very large or very small), so the
costume is made fairly flexible, able to be sized.  Once we cast the
person, we send them right down to wardrobe, where they're measured, and
the final adjustments made to size.
