20 May 1996<PRE>Yes, indeedy I did.  And I did it over there because we try to keep flames
OUT of the moderated group.  I've not said a word about the individual
involved here, or on any other service (despite that person's continued
attacks on me) since the mod group went up.  The situation existed there
long before I finally got sick of it and responded.  (Odd choice, btw, on
what you chose to include and what to leave out of the message thread.)

In any event...this is a flame-free area.  Let's keep it that way.
