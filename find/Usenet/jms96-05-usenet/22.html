10 May 1996<PRE>Re: being less active here...in some ways it's the interface, which I find
kind of cumbersome...mainly, though, right now there ain't much on my end
to talk about.  Overall, my posts to all the nets are down right now,
because when we're in hiatus -- and this forum went up right as hiatus hit
-- all is shut down, and there ain't much going on to tell folks about. 
One becomes something of a balloon with the air let out.  And, natch,
there's the annual anxiety of waiting for word.  Once things start gearing
up, and we get word, I'll have more to talk about.  Otherwise, I just
hesitate to fill up space with words just to hear the sound of my own
voice.  I'm kinda like Marcus that way, I talk when I have something to
say that might be remotely interesting to people.
