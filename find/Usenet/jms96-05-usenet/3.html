<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Attention to detail</H2>
6 May 1996<PRE>Janet: thanks.  It's just always seemed to me that if you're going to
create a fictional universe, you should do your homework.  Now, having
said that, there are plenty of areas where I haven't fleshed out some
stuff as much as I'd like (and no, I'm not telling you where they are;
it's nothing you'd notice, really).  But I could do that every day, 24
hours a day, and still not finish everything...a universe is a BIG place. 
Still, the more I can do, the realer the show becomes.
