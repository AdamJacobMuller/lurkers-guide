<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Enlightenment through laughter</H2>
6 May 1996<PRE>Nuts...I'll have to go drag out my Zen books on this one...it's a
reference I came upon for "the laughing buddha," which features a very old
painting of same, and the thoughts on laughter and enlightenment.  That
might be a good reference point for starting off, at least.
