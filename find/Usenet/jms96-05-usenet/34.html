<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Keeping your relationships alive</H2>
12 May 1996<PRE>Y'know, it ain't often that a question stops me and leaves me staring at
the screen for ten minutes trying to decide what the hell to say....

I guess the answer isn't a good one, Stef.

Everything in my life is subsumed into the work.  Especially for B5.  You
must understand, this isn't just a show for me, isn't just a job, some
bucks.  This show means almost everything to me right now.  My personal
life, my health, my relationships, everything comes second to the work.  

And someday, there will be a reckoning for that. 

I'll likely revisit this subject at some point in the future...but not
tonight.
