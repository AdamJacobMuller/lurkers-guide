<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Surprised You??? (SPOILER for "Interludes and Examinations")</H2>
13 May 1996<PRE>Mainly, I think I was just trying to avoid it...put it off as long as
possible...but the character knew, even more than I did, that this was the
right time to do this.  It's a very hard thing to do this to a character;
the only way to get that kind of emotion into a script is to feel it
yourself as you're writing it, and that's a painful thing to do.  So I was
avoiding it.  But he outfoxed me...as usual.

That's Vorlons for you.
