24 May 1996<PRE>"Would Delenn have been as close-mouthed with her non-Minbari allies about
the Shadows and their motives as she has been through WWE 1-2 if, instead
of attacking various beings from other races, the Shadows had attacked the
Minbari?"

A darned good question.

My gut says...no, she wouldn't have.  She'd probably justify it on the
assumption that the Minbari know the full story, thus are not expendable.
