23 May 1996<PRE>Well, not too much to say about the last 5 at this point...Erica Gimbel is
in "Walkabout," for which I wrote two songs...Pat Tallman's also in that
one, meeting the new Vorlon in town...there's a bunch of different
religious folks hanging around in "And the Rock Cried Out, No Hiding
Place," Franklin hits a crisis point in "Shadow Dancing," Melissa Gilbert
appears in two eps toward the end of the season, as does Jeff Cory...we'll
get to see Morden again, and Refa, and some more Centauri nobility.

The big stuff I'm obviously holding back.
