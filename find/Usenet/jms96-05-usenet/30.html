12 May 1996<PRE>Yes, I'd be willing to let outsiders to arc stories, though I'd have to be
a lot more vigilent.  (Actually, some arc elements have appeared here and
there in freelance scripts, when I've noted the necessity of their
inclusion.)  They generally are told only what they need to know.

The only thing that could compel me to write all the episodes next season
would be if we were told, up front and in advance, that the show was going
to run four years instead of five, and I had to pull it all together to
finish the story.  (Which can be done, though obviously it ain't my
preferred method.)  It'd also have to be much more of a serial in
structure.  Absent that, no, I don't plan on doing this again.
