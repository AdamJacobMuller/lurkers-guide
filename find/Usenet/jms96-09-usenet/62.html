<H2>Re: Star Trek's and Babylon 5's special effects</H2>
21 Sep 1996<PRE>The only problem with comparing B5 and ST EFX is that more and more, ST is
going to our mode of doing things.  The first new Voyager ep up this
season had most of their space EFX provided by Foundation, the CGI company
we've been using.  So the fundamental elements were the same, by the same
people, using the same technology, at the same company.  

On the theory that one doesn't deliberately do things that will be
*inferior* to what you have done before, that the ST shows are gradually
changing over to CGI, in many cases from the same people that provided our
CGI, would seem to imply that they themselves have decided it's
better...which makes the whole discussion kinda moot.
