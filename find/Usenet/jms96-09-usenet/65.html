23 Sep 1996<PRE>Re: higher levels of mental disorder among writers...I don't agree with
that at all.

     Neither do I.

Shut up, nobody asked you for your opinion.

     Hey, I have access to the keyboard too, you know.

I'm not listening.

     Neither am I.

Never mind...let me get back to this later, when Certain Parties --

     I heard that.

-- have gone to sleep.  Meanwhile, I'd just pass this along for your
edification: in surveys of the clinically insane, the #1 goal for most of
them when they get out, what they want...is to become psychologists or
psychiatrists...like the fellow who made this analysis of writers.
