19 Sep 1996<PRE>I'd be happy to comment...except it ain't my project, and I think any
commentary from me on David's project would be inappropriate.  It's his
pony ride.  I'll say only that David's been around a LONG time, he's a
solid writer, he knows and respects the genre, and if anyone can pull off
a show like this, it's him.  I'm looking forward to it.
