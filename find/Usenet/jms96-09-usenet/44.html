<H2>Re: B5 dreams of Londo</H2>
13 Sep 1996<PRE>Speaking of dreams...I recently got caught in a dream feedback loop.

When I was at Worldcon in Anaheim, I made the mistake of eating a hot
pretzel in the shape of Mickey Mouse's head right before going to bed.  In
the dream, I had this thick head of hair...and somebody asked me how it
felt, having this thick head of hair, and I said, "Great, and now at last
I have a title for my autobiography: `I Dreamed I Had Hair.'"

And on this I shot staight awake, thinking "What the HELL was THAT?"

It's Mickey's fault.
