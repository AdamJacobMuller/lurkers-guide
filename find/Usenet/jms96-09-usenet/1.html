2 Sep 1996<PRE>Re: the number of folks at the two B5 presentations (the official one and
the hastily arranged second) at Worldcon...the first room held (seated)
1500 people, I was told.  There were about another 500 who were allowed
finally to stand in the back.  So figure 2,000.  The second panel was in
A9, which held 800, and we had about 2-3rds of that, so figure about
400-600, so you're looking at a total of about 2,400-2,600, which is about
what we had at San Diego Comic Con.  We're talking here roughly 1/2 of the
entire Convention attendance, maybe a smidge less.

I was forwarded a piece of email from one of the convention organzers
expressing his grave doubts that the presentation would draw more than 20%
of the whole convention...we got nearly 50 percent.

I have to say, btw, that this WorldCon was probably the best, and most
well organized WorldCons I've ever attended.  No hassles, no frustrations,
it was just a joy.
