<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Thanks for Worldcon.</H2>
3 Sep 1996<PRE>I was happy to do the second presentation.  I was kinda tired...I put a
lot into these things, so I was physically dead meat by the time the
second one came around...but that was the only slot they had open, and I
was determined that people weren't going to get stiffed.  Anybody who's
been in line for hours -- and some people were there a LONG time --
deserves more than that.  I've been in those sorts of lines, and gotten
cut off or shut out, and I won't let it happen to anybody else where I'm
concerned.
