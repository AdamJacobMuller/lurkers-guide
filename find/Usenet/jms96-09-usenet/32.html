12 Sep 1996<PRE>To your questions:

Yes, we'll see Theo once more in year 3.

You'll hear more from ISN in year 4.

The new Vorlon arrives in "Walkabout," and Lyta's situation will be
explored more in the first part of year 4.

The Earth First and other groups haven't gone away, but been consolidated,
as we'll find soon enough.
