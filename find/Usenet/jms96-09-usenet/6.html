<H2>Re: Quit complaining about JMS's comments</H2>
3 Sep 1996<PRE>"Something to think about.  If people complain too much about JMS's posts
then perhaps he might not take so much time out of his busy schedule to
enlighten us with them."

Not much chance of that.  Zero, actually.  I've been riding the nets, and
taking the brickbats with the praise, since 1984.  Very little fazes me. 
Complaints are part and parcel, and sometimes they're justified, and
sometimes they're not, but they're just a part of the process.  

Nutcases are, natch, a somewhat different issue...but them we just deal
with.
