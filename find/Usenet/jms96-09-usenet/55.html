19 Sep 1996<PRE>You can quote my message...I'd have to dig through endless files to find
my SFWA resignation...but the message only tells about 10% of the story,
so it's almost not worth the trouble.  It's kinda like a Martian landing
right after the end of the Civil War and asking a soldier trudging back
from the final field of battle, "So, what happened?"  Where do you
start...?
