<H2>Re: ATT JMS: Demon Night</H2>
3 Sep 1996<PRE>Morgan: in hearing the sorts of books you like, I have two words for you:
Jonathan Carroll.  Try his "Bones of the Moon," or if you can find it,
"The Land of Laughs."

"Demon Night" was a decent first attempt; I never actually wrote it
intending for it to ever be published; I just sorta wrote it for myself,
as an exercise, then stuck it in a closet for almost 3 years until my
agent one day suggested I write one someday, and I mentioned I had one. 
Almost didn't give it to her, figuring it was an okay start, but I needed
to really learn more.  She read it, loved it, gave it to her NY associate,
who sold it to the first editor who looked at it, and it got a Bram Stoker
Award nomination from the Horror Writers of America.  So what the heck do
I know...?
