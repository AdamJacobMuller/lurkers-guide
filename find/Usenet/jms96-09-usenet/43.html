13 Sep 1996<PRE>"Who exactly owns the 3D models, the textures, all the stuff that
Foundation made for the EFX in the episodes?  I assume you or Warner Bro.
does."

WB owns it all.  WB owns the copyright on B5 (as does every studio
producing a series, as Paramount owns ST), and anything produced in the
process of making that show.  

"Part of the reason I ask is, I swear I saw some models or parts of models
in Hypernauts.""

Very likely.  I think the rule is that if you change it more than 50%, you
can use it for secondary purposes.

"Are the new guys (NDE) still using Lightwave 3D/Video Toasters etc.?  It
would be a major pain to try and convert all the 3D models over into a new
format.  Also, I'm a Lightwave fan . . ."

I'm reasonably sure it's all been ported over to a PC platform, but it's
still Lightwave.  These are the latest machines off the line, and they're
extremely fast and powerful.
