<H2>Re: ATT JMS: Demon Night</H2>
3 Sep 1996<PRE>Writing novels is something I do want to get back to; my next novel is
already fully outlined, I have all the research stuff I need, but it's a
1,000 page story, and I need one fairly focused year to write it.  So as
much as I enjoy writing novels, it'll have to wait until I'm done with B5,
alas.
