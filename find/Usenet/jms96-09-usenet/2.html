Yeah, I really can't disagree with that analysis.  The Jeremiah thread was
one of those things that looks great on paper, but when you get it into a
camera...I dunno, it's one of those weirdnesses that happens in
television.  Sometimes you've got what you think is an average script and
it just roars to life on-camera, and something that looks great on paper,
but in real life...ehh...I'm happy with all the other stuff in the
episode, but the Jeremiah thread didn't come off as it should've.

I think in part it's also my fault, in that my brain was gearing up for
the stuff that begins ramping up starting with the next episode, and the
Grey 17 thing was something I'd wanted to do for a long time, and there
wasn't going to be a chance to do it down the road, if at all, after this
season, so I went for it.  As for the Zarg, that's also one of those
things that didn't come off visually as I'd wanted.  So overall, I'd
agree...of all the season 3 eps, this one is probably the least effective
of them all.  But one in a season, that ain't too bad....
