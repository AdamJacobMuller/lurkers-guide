<H2>Re: JMS: What happened to your website?</H2>
19 Sep 1996<PRE>You have to understand, I'm a perfectionist...nothing leaves my hands
until it's as good as I can make it.

I was diddling around with the AOL software for making a web page, and
seeing what worked and what didn't, on the theory that down the road I
could use it to put out some more personally-oriented stuff (like my
writing book) without taking up time on the public forums to do so. 
Anyway, I was just playing with it, and had left what I was doing in
place...and somebody found it.  It was never intended to be seen in that
state, so I deleted it.
