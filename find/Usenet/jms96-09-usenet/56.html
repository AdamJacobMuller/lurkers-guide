<H2>Re: Londo's Lament, Redemption or Fire?  (long)</H2>
19 Sep 1996<PRE>There's another way to look at this, which occured to me as I was writing
it, so I structured it accordingly.

Morella: "You must save the eye that does not see."

Londo:  "I...do not understand."

I.

Eye.

We never actually saw how she spelled or meant this.

Given Londo's background, one could almost make the case that the
discussion was about him.  Not saying that's it, but it's a possibility
and a subtext.
