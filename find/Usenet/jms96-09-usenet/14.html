<H2>Re: BattleGround Earth: New Series with b5 ties</H2>
3 Sep 1996<PRE>"Could this have anything to do with that nasty rumor floating around
about the possible loss of B5's season 5 because of people affiliated with
the show leaving to do something else?  I've been out of the loop for a
couple of week (starting grad. school).  Last I heard about this rumor
was...nothing.  No confirmations _or_ denials..."

Up until right before I left for Worldcon, I hadn't heard a word of this
rumor.  Then I got an email from someone asking if it were true.  I asked
if WHAT were true?  The correspondent explained that according to rumor, I
was leaving B5 to go to Fox and develop shows for them.

Suffice to say this was the first time I'd heard ANY of this, and it's
utterly false.
