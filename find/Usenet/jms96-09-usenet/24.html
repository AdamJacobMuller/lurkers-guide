<H2>Re: B5 vs. ST:V</H2>
5 Sep 1996<PRE>Can someone answer me some questions about the premiere, 'cause some stuff
just didn't seem to make sense.  I've tried to never pick on ST:V for its
stories, for obvious reasons, but some stuff here just jumped out at
me....

Why were Starfleet officers, or hardened renegade Maquis, standing around
huddled and cold, rubbing their arms like lost children and looking
helpless when they should've been survival-trained at the basic Academy
level?  They were taught every aspect of a circuit board and a tachyon
field...but they don't know you can make fire easier with a couple of
flints than rubbing sticks together?  They looked utterly helpless without
their technology.

If the Kazon are mad because Voyager won't share its technology, then they
don't have that technology, right?  So in that case, how were they able to
know how to run every circuit of the ship when they came aboard, with zip
time to study it?  It seems to me they knew how to run it, how to fix it,
how to adjust it...so how is it they can say they don't have the
technology?  

You come across bones lying on the ground, and nobody considers that these
may have been either a) a burial site (leave it alone) or b) remains from
a predator (get the hell out)?  

They built a solar still out of the dead ensign's uniform, but they
couldn't make a fire?  Say what?

And then people just wander out of camp, by themselves, in the night, when
they know there are predators and enemies around?  

Starfleet Academy must've become nothing more than an engineering school,
because a Boy Scout has better survival skills than this bunch.
