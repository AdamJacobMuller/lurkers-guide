8 Sep 1996<PRE>Ah...a very sad case, that.  Turhan's only child, his son, died during a
boating accident, of all things.  He drowned.  His personal guard, who was
apparently unable to find Turhan's son in the murky water, was found dead
several days after making his report; his own death was officially ruled a
suicide, out of grief.  But there are always stories....
