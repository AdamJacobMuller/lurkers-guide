<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Bradbury</H2>
3 Sep 1996<PRE>I think I probably haven't separated out Bradbury's work for special
attention mainly because it's so much "in the air," that it's part of
one's environment, and one doesn't notice it sufficiently to comment on
it.

Bradbury was one of the first SF authors I stumbled across, specifically
"The Martian Chronicles," which just blew my brains across the wall and
splattered them on the library windows.  His use of language, imagery, the
very human details of his work...it astonished me.  Sometimes I hear
Bradbury creeping into my dialogue from time to time...a turn of phrase or
a word choice.  

Interestingly enough, if you ask Bradbury who was one of his primary
influences, prehaps the most singular influence, he'll cite Norman Corwin
as well.
