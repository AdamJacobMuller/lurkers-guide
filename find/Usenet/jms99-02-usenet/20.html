27 Feb 1999<PRE>What you have to understand at this point is that there's really no time left. 
It takes a large amount of money to hold a cast and crew together while other
options are being sought, and even then options on varoius cast members and
others begin to expire fast.

WB can't keep spending holding money while they're seeking another prospect. 
It's a business decision, but a sensible one, given the large amounts of money
involved.  Their approach now is to believe in the show enough to get it on the
air, let the ratings speak for themselves, and see what happens.

My only regret is for the cast, who are all uniformly terrific, and who are
caught out in all this.
