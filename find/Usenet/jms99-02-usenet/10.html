<H2>Re: attn: JMS. Book release order?</H2>
12 Feb 1999<PRE>&gt;There seems to be some confusion arising on the UK newsgroup about which
&gt;group of the three trilogies will be coming out next. I know a lot of us
&gt;want the Centauri Prime trilogy next (for obvious reasons) but it sounds as
&gt;though the Technomage trilogy is coming out first (after the Psi Corps
&gt;trilogy is finished). So which is it? And, if the Jeanne Cavelos novels will
&gt;be out before the Peter David ones, when can we expect Peter David's work to
&gt;hit the book shops?
&gt;
&gt;
My guess (it's to some extent a matter of how fast they get it done after I
turn in the outlines) is that we'll get the next Psi Corps novel first, then a
Technomage novel, then the final Psi Corps/Bester novel, then the first
Centauri novel, the second Technomage novel, and after that your guess is as
good as mine.
