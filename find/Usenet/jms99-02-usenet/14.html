<H2>Re: Schuster's unauthorized book</H2>
16 Feb 1999<PRE>I've communicated with Mr. Schuster, and he has agreed to remove from future
copies of the book all of the material taken from my internet postings.

That doesn't affect the copies already on stands, but all copies produced
henceforth (it's a self published operation, with limited numbers made at any
time) will be done without that copyrighted material.
