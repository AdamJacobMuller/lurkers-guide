20 Feb 1999<PRE>&gt;In the latest B5 magazine, it says that you may be voicing one of the
&gt;puppets on an upcoming Sifl and Olly episode.  Will this still be
&gt;happening?
&gt;
&gt;

Haven't heard back.  Liam said they wanted to make me into a sock puppet for
the show.  I said it would be redundent, but they were welcome to go for it. 
So we'll see....
