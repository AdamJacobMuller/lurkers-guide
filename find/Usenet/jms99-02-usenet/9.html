<H2>New Words</H2>
12 Feb 1999<PRE>Every so often, I come up with new words for stuff...came up with a couple the
other day, thought I'd pass 'em along.

When you're talking on the phone to someone who's online in a chat or doing
email, and there's that constant pause between what you say and their
reply...that's "net-lag."

When you're making a turn in a car and there's people in the way: a flack of
pedestrians.

Tha'ts it...just a thought....
