<H2>Re: Attn. JMS:  Writer Ageism/60 Minutes</H2>
22 Feb 1999<PRE>&gt;Is or was there any writer ageism present in your experience writing B5 and
&gt;elsewhere?  60 Minutes did an interesting piece on older writers having
&gt;trouble working?  What's your take on this issue?  I think a good writer
&gt;regardless of age with a good story can sell it.

I haven't personally experienced it, but only because I'm still in my middle
40s (44).  However I know a number of people who *have* been affected by it,
and it's a genuine problem.  The irony is that many of the shows that say "we
want mid-twenties writers only" are being run by guys in their fifties...so if
they can create it and write for it, why can't somebody else in that age range?
