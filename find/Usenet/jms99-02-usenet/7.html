<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Whatcha up to now?</H2>
10 Feb 1999<PRE>&gt;I was just 
&gt;curious how you will be spending your time during this potentially nerve-
&gt;wracking waiting period? Will you be writing more eps for Crusade? 
&gt;Working on your new comic (I can't wait to see it!)? Actually getting 
&gt;some sleep for a change?
&gt;
All that...plus working on the show, doing post production on the episodes
already in hand (CGI, music, sound, editing)...I'm actually about as busy as we
are during shooting.
