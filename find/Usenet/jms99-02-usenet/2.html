<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Star Trek style shuttle/fighter bays and TNT </H2>
1 Feb 1999<PRE>&gt; One part of it
&gt;that caught my attention is a reference to the shuttle and fighter bays
&gt;being pressurized, but having them open to space, the atmosphere being
&gt;kept in by a 'magnetic' shield or some technowizzit.

No, there is a definite (and very large) airlock door that closes after ships
enter the flight deck, so it can then be pressurized.
