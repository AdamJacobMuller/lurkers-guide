<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Network projects!</H2>
27 Feb 1999<PRE>&gt;So what sort of offers have you recieved? I'm just curious...anything
&gt;sci-fi-ish, or a drama? 

It's a number of things; to run some network shows, to create others (blind
pilot deals, meaning I write it, they buy it)...one network called late Friday
as word got out and asked if I'd do a non-SF TV movie for them while the rest
is in discussion (I said sure)...I can't talk about it much until the dust
settles and I decide where to land.
