8 Feb 1999<PRE>&gt;will you be reverting back to your
&gt;original plan and air "Racing the Night" first? I ask since you stated that
&gt;TNT
&gt;requested you reshuffle your story and make an introductory episode, titled
&gt;"War Zone".

No, because the season was structured in such a way as to make that impossible.
 You'll understand when you see what was done.
