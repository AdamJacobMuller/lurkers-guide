<H2>Re: The Deconstruction of Falling Stars. ( *Spoilers* )</H2>
5 Nov 1997<PRE>
&gt;you've provided characters and cultures that the fans of B5 
&gt;really come to appreciate, and it would have been a cool thing to have 
&gt;seen how all these facets of the B5 universe fared during the 100, 500, 
&gt;1000, and ultimately the million years later perspective that 
&gt;"Deconstruction" gave us.

With another 45 minutes, would've loved to.

&gt;So what else has been happening with everyone all this time?
&gt;
&gt;
KEG PARTY!!!
