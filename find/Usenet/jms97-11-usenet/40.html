<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Comic Queries?</H2>
17 Nov 1997<PRE>&gt;  Have you written any other comics?
&gt; 
Yes; wrote an issue of the Twilight Zone comic for NOW comics, a DC Teen Titans
 Special, Two-Face vs. Cyborg, the ST comic you mention, and the first B5 comic
 issue.

&gt;      What comics have you enjoyed reading and dare I ask, do you enjoy
&gt;reading nowadays?  (and you can't just say Neil's stuff.  That's
&gt;cheating.)
&gt;

Most anything by Alan Moore, though he's started getting a tad obscure even for
 me.  I loved Marvels, and just bought Alex Ross' Justice Society print.  Also
 very fond of Grant Morrison's work.   
&gt;     Any new info on the B5 comic?

It's already coming out in installments in the B5 UK magazine, and
 solicitations are going out in Diamond Distributers catalog for the US
 printing from DC (three issues).

As it turns out, I've just approached Dark Horse as the top of my list for a
 new comic I've come up with, also with a 5-year arc but with nothing to do
 with B5, something I don't think has been done much in superhero comics
 before.  I'm giving them a little while longer to get back to me on it, and
 then I'm going to take it out to the marketplace.  Justd went to DH first
 because I've loved their prior work.
