Yes, the Ranger pins are illegal, pirate merchandise.  Also crap, from what
 I've seen.

We're moving as fast as we can to get high-quality pins out there to cut the
 knees out from under the crooks.  Earth Alliance pins are now available
 through thestation.com, and the Psi Corps pins just came in.  We hope to have
 Ranger pins soon, though they will be a little more costly since they're huge
 and require a great deal of work to produce if they're going to look like what
 they're supposed to be.
