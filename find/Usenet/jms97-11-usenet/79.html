29 Nov 1997<PRE>Well, bear in mind that I've had about 4 years of feedback, so there's
that...and in our first season, there was just as much lead time so we're used
to it.

And there's only a 3 month break here between the last S4 ep and the new
season, which is less than we've had in other cases.
