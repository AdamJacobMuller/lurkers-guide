27 Nov 1997<PRE>&gt;1) Will TNT 'shave' the show to put in more commercials?
&gt;

Nope.

&gt;2) Is there a book or CD or site that you, JMS, would recommend
&gt;as a way for someone to pick up the story.

There's the lurker's guide (www.midwinter.com) and thestation.com, and the new
B5 informational CDrom which just came out has heaps of info about the B5
universe.
