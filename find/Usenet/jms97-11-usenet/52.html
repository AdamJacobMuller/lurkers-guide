<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Widescreen anywhere in world?</H2>
20 Nov 1997<PRE>My reply was in reference to a widescreen film release, or at least that's what
 I thought I was replying to.  To go to film for widescreen would take some
 work and recompositing the stuff to film stock.

Yes, B5 is shown in widescreen in France and Portugal.  Bear in mind that these
 tend to be digital transfers from digital betacam to PAL format, as opposed to
 transferring all the CGI to film stock.

At the end of the day, when the series is done, we'll transfer all the CGI to
 film so we can deliver the entire series on film stock.
