20 Nov 1997<PRE>&gt;
&gt;According to Ain't It Cool Coaxial News, TNT is currently test screening
&gt;In the Beginning.  The person who reported it was very impressed.  Ther
&gt;article is at http://www.aint-it-cool-news.com/coaxial/971117/1.html but
&gt;it really doesn't say anything that we don't know.

Actually, it wasn't a test screening, it was a screening for cast and crew.
