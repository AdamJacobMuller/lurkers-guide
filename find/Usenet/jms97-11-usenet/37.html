12 Nov 1997<PRE>&gt;Consider yourself vindicated: they are really popular, but they've kind
&gt;of peaked already.

Well, if I hadn't heard of them (and most people haven't that I've talked to)
 then it's a new thing for me.  

Peaked already?  The second album is great, and I think that their popularity
 is only going to grow, particularly here in the US.  

Folks looking on...I ain't kidding.  If you haven't listened to either fo the
 Portishead albums, you're missing a real treat.
