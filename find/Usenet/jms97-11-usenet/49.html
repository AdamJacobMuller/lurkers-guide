<H2>Re: Zathra not be liking Portishead</H2>
20 Nov 1997<PRE>&gt;Zathra next is buying Portishead.  Zathra put CD in player, and dog of 
&gt;Zathra is starting to howl.  Zathra is rarely ever hearing such terrible 
&gt;noises.  Zathra is now looking for Zathras.  Zathra wants to be giving 
&gt;Zathras very big wedgie.  

Zathras say Zathras has tin ear.  Zathras say Zathras behind times.  Zathras
 would say "feh" but Zathras not having background in Early Eastern European
 and Yiddish vocabularies would be stretching credulity.  Zathras not like
 stretching credulity, always snaps back and hits poor Zathras in the face.

But Zathras understand.  Many different kinds of music in universe, not all
 Zathras like.  Is why there are nine of us.  All have different opinions, all
 speak opinions, all good people.

One has tin ear.

feh.
