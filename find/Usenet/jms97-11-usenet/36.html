12 Nov 1997<PRE>I'd say, strictly on an appearance basis, that the 6" figures are a bit better
 than the 9" ones.  And as for the collector's plates, Hamilton did its usual
 market tests with mainstream collectors (who don't know from B5) and ST fans,
 and based on this decided that there wasn't any market out there for B5
 collectibles.

No comment.
