4 Nov 1997<PRE>Spoilers for The Deconstruction of Falling Stars.

























&gt;JMS... how can I put this... we know the ending.  I mean, we KNOW it.  We
&gt;know
&gt; it.  We know it.  They get rid of the virus.  There is no virus in 100
&gt;years. 
&gt; There is no Telepath domination in 100 years, and there is DEFINATELY an
&gt; Alliance in 100 years. 

I think that, if we all put on our logic caps for a moment, I'm not liable to
 wipe out all of Humanity in the course of pursuing the Crusade series.  (It
 would wreak havoc with residuals, for one thing.)

As with anything else, B5 (in whatever incarnation) is about *process*.  You
 saw Londo being strangled by G'Kar...but you didn't know how they got there. 
 You know the result of the Earth/Minbari war...but I suspect there will be a
 lot of surprises in "In the Beginning."

As with all things, the joy is in the going.  We all know we're going to die,
 that as the poet said, "we are born astride the grave."  But knowing that
 inevitable reality has never stopped human endeavor before....

It's the journey and the doing that matters.
