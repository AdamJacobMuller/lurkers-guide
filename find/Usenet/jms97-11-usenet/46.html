&gt;Doesn't that Fan Club do phone orders?
&gt;
We're not set up for phones yet. 

&gt;I just got two of the Antioch B5 Calendars Uncomyn Gifts.  They're
&gt;incredible!

Yeah, they're great

&gt;Antioch calendars, and some other items
&gt;through the Fan Club to give to some B5 buddies for Christmas.  Snail
&gt;mail may not make it in time. A phone number for orders would cut the
&gt;time in half.

As it happens, either today or tomorrow the B5 fan club website
 (www.thestation.com) will be finally set up to take orders via the site
 itself, with a *very* secure credit card server.  So you can log on as soon as
 it's up, put in the info, and it'll get processed fast.  (Especially for
 initial orders, before things start to get busy.)
