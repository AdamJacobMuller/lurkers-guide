<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Directing creativity and richness in CGI</H2>
20 Nov 1997<PRE>&gt;I was interested in how you're able to direct the CGI creations to
&gt;match the story so well.  They would work from scripts I'd expect -
&gt;are there story boards you use as well? How much lead time does all
&gt;that CGI creative process need?
&gt;
&gt;
Sometimes there are storyboards, based on what's in the script, if it's a very
 complex sequence.  Usually, it's shot for shot what's in the script, though
 the animators find ways to visualize that in creative and exciting ways,
 making it dynamic.

Each numbered scene calling for CGI is done individually, then sent back for my
 and John Copeland's approval.  Usually that means just saying yes, but
 sometimes we ask for adjustments.  

It takes about 52 days to finish all the CGI for one episode.
