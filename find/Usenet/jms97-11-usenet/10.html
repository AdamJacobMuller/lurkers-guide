<H2>Re: ATTN:JMS Who influences the actors?</H2>
2 Nov 1997<PRE>&gt;The actors are
&gt;all quite talented, but who works with them to give them that extra bit
&gt;of insight, or inspiration that they all seem to have, and what form
&gt;does the feedback take?

On a day-to-day "What the hell does THIS mean?" basis, that would be me, or if
 I'm otherwise engaged, John Copeland.  On an episode-by-episode basis, that
 would be the director.

Most everything is covered in the script; if there are additional questions
 they can go to one of the above.  If I or someone else in that group has a
 note, we pass it on directly to the actor.
