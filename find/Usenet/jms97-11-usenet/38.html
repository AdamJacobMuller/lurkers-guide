<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Why no Sinclair in "The Beginning" ?</H2>
12 Nov 1997<PRE>&gt; How's it possible to make
&gt;a movie about the Earth-Minbari war without even mentioning
&gt;Sinclair?
&gt;
&gt;
Nobody said he wouldn't be mentioned; using the footage we shto from "And the
 Sky Full of Stars," he's in the last part of the movie.  Bear in mind that at
 the time he was a squadron leader assigned to Earth as part of the defense
 network there, so didn't have a great deal to do with the larger parts of the
 war.

Basically, each character (with the exception of one or two) gets one or two
 scenes in the movie (we have a lot of them, remember).  To bring Michael out
 from New York, at first class airfare, plus accommodations, salary, for one or
 two scenes (one of which we already *had* him for) was impossible under the
 budget, much as we discussed it and would've been interested in doing so.
