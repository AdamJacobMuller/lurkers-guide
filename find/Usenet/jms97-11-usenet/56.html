<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: CD prices at B5 Emporium</H2>
21 Nov 1997<PRE>&gt;The _correct_ regular prices for these CD's, from the Sonic Images web
&gt;site, are $13.99 for the soundtracks, and $10.98 (_below_ the Member
&gt;Price!) for the episodes. 

That's because Chris, as maker of the CDs, can charge less since there's no one
else in the loop.  That's pretty much the wholesale price.
