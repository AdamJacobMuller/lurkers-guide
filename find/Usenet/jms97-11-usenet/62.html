23 Nov 1997<PRE>&gt;So, it's possible that the person who gave the glowing review was probably an
&gt;insider and probably biased to give a good review.

Not necessarily.  A number of folks not directly involved with the show, who
didn't know diddly about B5, were invited as sort of guinea pigs to see how the
show would be received, and many of those on the show brought friends who
hadn't seen it before, so it could've been anyone.
