8 Nov 1997<PRE>&gt; was the use of
&gt;combined words such as "realfact" and "goodfact" in the 500 year
&gt;sequence similarly a tip of the hat to David Brin's "The Crystal
&gt;Spheres", which made considerable use of this technique?

Since I never read it, the answer would be no.  

This is a common technique in literary SF, from 1984 to Brave New World, some
 cyberpunk stuff...it's pretty common stuff.
