<H2>Re: The Deconstruction of Falling Stars. ( *Spoilers* )</H2>
27 Nov 1997<PRE>Re: the whole money thing...if I'd been in this for the money, I would've
stayed where I was on Murder, She Wrote.  I took a substantial pay cut to come
do B5, even though the position here was higher than my position on M,SW.

The script fees for syndication are a little over half what they are for a
network show; the residuals are more in network; the producing fees are double
what I'm getting in network...there ain't no pile of gold in syndication, boys
and girls.  If I was in this for the money, I'd go back to nework TV.

Thing is, I can't tell these kinds of stories in network TV.  So I'm here. 

Nobody's put a pile of gold in front of me yet.  Not that I'm opposed to the
idea, it'd be nice if someone did it, I'd certainly be inclined to be
grateful...but it just hasn't happened.
