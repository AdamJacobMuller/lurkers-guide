I'm not quoted at ALL.  I never, at any time, said that B5 fans were in any way
 smarter than ST fans.  The person who wrote the article came up with that as a
 lead that has, and had, nothing to do with anything I said.  All I talked
 about was the close relationship with B5 fans through treating them with
 respect.  I think he may have been looking for a quote like that, but I didn't
 give him one, and thus it didn't appear.  

Never said it.  If I had, it'd be there.
