<H2>Re: The Deconstruction of Falling Stars. ( *Spoilers* )</H2>
6 Nov 1997<PRE>&gt;When Sinclair referred the sun going cold and burning out in Season 1 in
&gt;the ISN interview, was he prescient or was Desconstruction mapped out then?

One needn't be prescient...it's *going* to happen one day.

And to the second half...yeah, Deconstruction (or at least the events that
 would go into it)  was mapped out back then.
