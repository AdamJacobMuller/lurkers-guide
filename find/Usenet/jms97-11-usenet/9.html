<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Anthology Series</H2>
2 Nov 1997<PRE>&gt;Outside of a sixth B5 season which you've said would be "Tales of..."
&gt;eps, would you ever consider creating an anthology series for
&gt;television?  Are anthology series as tough to get started and keep
&gt;rolling as I've heard?  Are they more expensive to produce?

Actually, I've tried several times to get anthology series off the ground, but
 unless they're tied to a pre-sold name, nobody's interested.
