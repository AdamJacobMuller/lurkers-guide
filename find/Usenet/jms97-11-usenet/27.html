7 Nov 1997<PRE>I've heard about them, though I haven't had a chance to listen to them
 yet...but I gotta give you a big recommendation:

Portishead.

Yes, that's the name of a group, fairly new, brilliant stuff.  Go and buy.  I
 was right about Red Clay Ramblers, and Squirrel Nut Zippers (just before
 everyone else discovered them) and now I'm telling you...these guys are gonna
 be *huge*.
