23 Nov 1997<PRE>Thanks, though Jeffrey Willerth gets most of the credit for getting this puppy
up and running.  

So far the orders are coming in strong, and the first batch of orders (100 in
the first day alone) went out the very next day.

We're going to be adding more cool stuff shortly to the store.
