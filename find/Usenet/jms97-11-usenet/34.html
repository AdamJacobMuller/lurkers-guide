12 Nov 1997<PRE>&gt;If the producers and writers of DS9 find inspiration in B5 fine. 

It might be, maybe, if Paramount hadn't spent 5 years trying to shut us down,
 bury us, along the way intimidating at least one director into not  working
 with us, and generally doing everything imaginable  to drive us off television
 so they'd have the only space show in town.
