<H2>request from harlan</H2>
19 Nov 1997<PRE>
Harlan has asked me to ask y'all if you could do him a favor:

He is looking to get as many copies as he can of the Science Fiction Book Club
 "Things to Come" booklet/circular for December listing his book "City on the
 Edge of Forever" and any flyers that went with it.

If you have these on hand still, if you could send it on to Harlan Ellison c/o
 Babylon 5, 14431 Ventura Boulevard, Suite 260, Sherman Oaks, CA 91423, it
 would be *very* much appreciated.
