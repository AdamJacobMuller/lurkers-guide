&gt;So whats the latest news on any new literary projects of
&gt;yours?  And...will Demon Night or Othersyde ever be reprinted?

Eventually, yes, but I don't want those to be the first books out the docket
 after B5.  They're both pretty good, but I think that whatevert I do in the
 aftermath of B5 has got to be a hell ofa lot better than "pretty good."  

Basically, between the name value that has accrued to the show, and my
 background, I figure that good will can carry me through 2 or 3 books...but if
 they're not killer books, that's gonna be where it ends.  If anything, that
 knowedge is going to make me work *harder* on the books than if there were a
 lower profile involved, where you can make mistakes and nobody sees them.  

As for the future, I'm working on a couple of novels at roughly the same time
 as everything else...it's just a matter of when what gets finished, and how I
 feel about it.
