4 Nov 1997<PRE>&gt;my heart is set on a PsiCorp Pin, instead of the EA pin.
&gt;Is there any chance a real and licensed replica of the Psicorp Pin going
&gt;to be made at all?

By sheer coincidence, the prototype is in for the Fan Club, and we should have
 the first full order in hand within the next 7 days.

And they're totally cool and consistent with the show.
