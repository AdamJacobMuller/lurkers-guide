19 Nov 1997<PRE>
The UK series was named Space Patrol, but when it came time to show it in the
 States, they renamed it Planet Patrol to avoid legal complications and
 confusion in the marketplace.

As it happens, I'm getting a full run of the tapes in about a week from the
 distributer, and looking forward to it, as it was one of my favorite shows as
 a kid, though nobody else I ever spoke to in 20 years had ever heard of it.
