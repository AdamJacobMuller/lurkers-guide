<H2>Re: Slightly off topic: zinc lozenges</H2>
29 Nov 1997<PRE>Your best bet is to combine the zinc lozenges with chewable vitamin C, usually
at a base of about 2 to 1 in favor of the C.  I have found, each time, that it
cuts down the symptom and duration of the cold or flu 30-50%.  Just be sure to
eat something with it, because the acidity can build up pretty fast otherwise.
