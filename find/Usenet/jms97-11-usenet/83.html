<H2>Re: Harlan Ellison going to court as witness????</H2>
29 Nov 1997<PRE>&gt;Towards the end, in a paragraph beginning "AJ Bielow is working on this 
&gt;case,....." it is claimed that Harlan Ellison may be going to court as a 
&gt;witness in her favour.

As soon as I read this, I called Harlan (9:10 p.m. Friday night) and he stated
that he is not involved with any Dr. Who project or suit, and that he is not
testifying as a witness in any such situation, and that this is not a true
statment.
