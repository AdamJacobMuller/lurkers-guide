<H2>Re: Official Guide to B5 CD Rom</H2>
27 Nov 1997<PRE>&gt;I also kinda hoped that we'd be able to learn more about the Dilgar and
&gt;Markabs even though they are gone but this CD was full (640MB) so I guess VOL
&gt;2 :)

The conceit we used in designing the cdrom was that it's a guide to the present
B5 as of the end of the fourth season...them's what's gone, is gone, them's
what remains, get discussed.  It's the guide you'd get upon arriving, rather
than a history of the B5 universe, which is a daunting prospect.
