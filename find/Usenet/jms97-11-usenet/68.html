<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: B5 online store is up! but at what cost?</H2>
26 Nov 1997<PRE>The shipping costs of everything that comes out of the B5 fan club is on an
absolute par with everyone else out there.

As for shipping...yes, we could charge less for shipping, but we have been
cognizent of the requests from B5 fans that their stuff arrive *intact*.  The
calendars you cite don't just go out in regular envelopes, as others tend to
ship them...they go out UPS in a very strong container to prevent damage to
what is, after all, a collectible item.  Basically, you get what you pay for.
