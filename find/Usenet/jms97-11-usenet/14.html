<H2>Re: ATTN JMS  --- lessons Learned</H2>
4 Nov 1997<PRE>&gt;	Now that you are heading into the final season of the show I wonder
&gt;what you feel is the most important thing you;ve learned is?
&gt;That is, if you could go back in time and warn yourself of one thing, or
&gt;give yourself one piece of advice what would it be?

As it happens, it was something Kathryn said about year 2: "Don't figh the
 rabbits, the lions will get you."
