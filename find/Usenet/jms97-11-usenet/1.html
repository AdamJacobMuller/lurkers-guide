<H2>Re: Ship Recognition Posters</H2>
1 Nov 1997<PRE>&gt;The item that I was looking forward to recieving the most was the Ship
&gt;Recognition Poster.  When the shipment arrived&lt; I recieved a note that
&gt;told me that there were problems with the printer and the posters had been
&gt;delayed. 
&gt;  Does anyone have any information about when these posters are
&gt;supposed to come out?
&gt;
They just came in the door a couple of days ago, and they're *gorgeous*.  I got
 mine right off the top, natch....

That's the fun part, making the merchandise and cool stuff you'd just want for
 yourself....
