8 Nov 1997<PRE>&gt;So you're an idol.  I know its still hard for you to
&gt;comprehend.
&gt;	Feels weird, doesn't it? 
&gt;
&gt;
More than just a little.  I still have a hard time seeing myself in that role. 
 I just sorta do what I do; I'm doing what I was doing 10 years ago, even
 longer, just writing the kinds of stories I like.  Same person, different
 context.  

But I constantly doubt...I doubt if the show is good enough, if the work is
 good enough, if we did it right...I wonder if the show is getting enough
 attention, so I go out to try and get it, but then when it comes, I worry
 about the cult of personality...and then I worry that I'm worrying needlessly
 because one thing that typifies B5 fans is that the don't seem to fall for the
 cult of personality BS... and then I watch something by Serling and I feel
 like a total fraud...and then I have to face the blank page and worry that
 whatever the heck it was I did last time, I won't be able to do it again....

I know, I know...thorazine, and lots of it....
