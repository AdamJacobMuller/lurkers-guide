<H2>Re: Attn: JMS Yahoo article accurate?</H2>
24 Nov 1997<PRE>One more thing...

&gt;   Average IQ of a "Star Trek" fan: 152.
&gt;
&gt;            Average IQ of a "Babylon 5" fan: 170.
&gt;
&gt;            At least that's the way "Bab5" fans
&gt;            figure it.

I never mentioned IQs, nor were they mentioned by the reporter to me during the
 interview.  Further, the journalist here does not put those words in my mouth
 in ANY event, he says that's "the way the B5 fans figure it."  

In any event, I was as astonished to read that as anyone else.
