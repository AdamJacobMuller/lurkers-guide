<H2>repost from jms</H2>
20 Nov 1997<PRE>For some reason my other message never showed up (and several others seem to
 have not shown up)....

1) Harlan Ellison asks that if you still have the December Science Fiction Book
 Club circular, Things to Come, mentioning his book City on the Edge of
 Forever, and/or the flyers that came with it, to send them along to him via
 the B5 mail drop, 14431 Ventura Boulevard, Suite 260, Sherman Oaks, CA 91423.

2) The B5 emporium is now available for online purchases at www.thestation.com.

3) I'll be Guest of Honor at LosCon in Los Angeles over Thanksgiving Weekend at
 the Burbank Airport Hilton showing clips from Season 5 and the prequel, and
 new bloopers.
