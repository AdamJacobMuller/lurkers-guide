23 Nov 1997<PRE>&gt;Joe, if you're going to put back some 14 minutes of material in 
&gt;the Gathering, what, if anything, will have to be cut to make room
&gt;for it?

Not much, just little snippets of things...the show was *very* slow paced, and
once you pick up the pacing within scenes, whole vast tracts of time appear.
