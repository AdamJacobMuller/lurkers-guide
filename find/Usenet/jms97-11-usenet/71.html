<H2>Re: ATT: JMS: The Third TNT Movie</H2>
24 Nov 1997<PRE>&gt;I saw you mention the shooting dates for the third TNT movie, which must
&gt;mean the script is in the can -- would you please give us loyal fans
&gt;some tantalizing hints about this one?  When does it take place, which
&gt;characters does it feature, ANYTHING 

Actually, no, it isn't written yet.  I won't be able to have a clear field to
write it until after I've finished writing the 5th season.  I know in general
what I want to do with it, have fleshed out a lot, but until I've run the
premise past TNT and WB officially, I can't comment.
