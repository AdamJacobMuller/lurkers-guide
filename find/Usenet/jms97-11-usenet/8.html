<H2>Re: ATTN JMS:  Delenn &amp; Deconstruction question...</H2>
2 Nov 1997<PRE>&gt; How exactly did Delenn get into the studio so quickly?

Most TV studios that I've seen have back doors that open out onto the back lot
 or the outside for fire control reasons.  You can get into any of the 3 B5
 stages from the outside in, oh, about 5 seconds through any of a number of
 doors.  (Note to anyone looking on: yes, those stage doors are secured, and
 there are guards, and unless you're a Minbari you're not getting in.)  And
 most of the TV studios I've been in have been the same.
