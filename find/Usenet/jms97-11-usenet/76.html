27 Nov 1997<PRE>Yes, the models are a go, in fact I just recently approved the master mold for
the station, which is going to be huge.  

Should be out soon; we went back and forth a few times getting the texturing
right on the Starfury wings, but we finally got that worked out, and the things
look great.
