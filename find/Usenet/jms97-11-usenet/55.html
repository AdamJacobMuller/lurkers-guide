<H2>Re: ATTN JMS : In The Beginning -&gt; Ivy's Brother?</H2>
21 Nov 1997<PRE>&gt;I was wondering, is there any chance that we'll see Ivanova's brother in In
&gt;The
&gt;Beginning?

I'd say a very good chance.

&gt;P.S. What was that thing about Larry Ditillio setting your office on fire?

We'd declared war on each other across the hall, and I'd stolen his platen. 
&gt;From there, it escalated.
