<H2>B5 schedule.</H2>
9 Nov 1993<PRE>     Babylon 5 is on schedule, and on-budget.  You can't be ahead of
schedule in TV, because you have to allocate so many days for any single
episode, and that's written in stone.  But we're absolutely spot on, and
keeping to the budget, which is something of a first for an SF series.
