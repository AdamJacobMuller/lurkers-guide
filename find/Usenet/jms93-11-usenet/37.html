<H2>Re: Trek vs. B5</H2>
18 Nov 1993<PRE>     Thank you.  Be assured that we are working very hard not to
disappoint you, and I don't think we will.  This is, as you perceive,
not just another job for most of us involved with Babylon 5.  It is a
labor of love by those who enjoy SF, *for* those who enjoy SF.  It's the
show that *we* would want to watch, as fans.  Many of us are putting in
20 hour days, fighting to make every frame just right, because it means a
lot to us...and it is our hope that someday it may mean as much to others.
