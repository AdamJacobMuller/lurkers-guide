<H2>Re: Babylon 5</H2>
23 Nov 1993<PRE>     I'd say that, in certain instances, you may be more right than
wrong in your speculations.
 
     While I've certainly been positive about the show -- and believe I
have good reason to be positive -- I have avoid directly over-hyping the
show.  I've never, to the best of my knowledge, said that this will be
the best series in SF-TV history.  What I've said, by and large, is what
we're *doing*, and not much more.  When I get excited about something, I
say so, and I'm specific to that episode.  The greater measure of what you
might term "hype" comes from those who've followed the show, and from one
important fact: any promise I make on the content of a show, I keep.  I'm
very careful about that.
 
     The problem, though, with a show like this, presented in this
fashion, is that when people come to expect a Great Show, long ahead of
airdate, they begin to sketch out in their heads the show that *they*
would most like to see, the show they would make if given the chance.  And
that means you've got -- what? -- ten thousand different versions of a
show.  There's no way that anything I do can be exactly what every single
person would most like to see, what he or she sees in his/her mind's eye.
 So there will have to be some readjustment to what the show *is*
 
     I think, though, that the average SF-TV viewer is sharp enough to
figure that out, and adjust.  For myself, all I can do is make the best
show I can, the show that *I* would like to see made, that I would like to
watch...and hope for the best.
