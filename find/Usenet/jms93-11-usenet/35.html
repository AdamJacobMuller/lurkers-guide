<H2>Re: Trek vs. B5</H2>
17 Nov 1993<PRE>     "It (B5) will be a show that is not based on characters but based on
mystery."
 
     Wrong.
 
     Point a gun at someone's head.  See how it affects them.  Is the
resultant story about the gun, or about the person it's aimed at?
 
     On all of the series I've worked on, the one strong suit I've found,
the only story I'm really interested in telling, is a character story.  I
am not a big mystery fan.  What I enjoy are the characters.  While the
background of our series forms a low-level subtext, every single story
produced so far this season is a character story.  Very *strong*
character story.  The only episode in which it's a little light is in
the first episode, because we kind of re-establish our cast after the
delay of the pilot.  Even so, there's more character stuff there than in
the pilot, by quite a lot.  And the very next episode up, "Soul Hunter,"
is an extremely powerful character story.
 
     Anyway, it kind of amuses me to see someone say that B5 "will be"
one kind of show or another.  The only person who knows what the B5 story
will be is at this end of the keyboard.  And that *ain't* it.
