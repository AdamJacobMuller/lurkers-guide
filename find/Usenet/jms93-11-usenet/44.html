19 Nov 1993<PRE>     The point you make is absolutely true.  For every person who wants to
do something, there are always 15 people to tell him or her why it can't
be done, why it won't work, why you'll fail.  Okay, fine, there are risks.
 Nothing of substance is ever accomplished WITHOUT taking risks.  Sometimes
you fail, sometimes you don't.  But what's the alternative?
 
     One of my prize items in my office is a WWII pin from the Royal
Air Force.  It has the following motto emblazoned on it: "Who Dares, Wins."
  You have to dare from time to time.
 
     For six years -- seven by the time this series hits air -- there have
been people saying that this show couldn't be done...that it couldn't be
done for the money (we proved otherwise), that you couldn't get the kind
of EFX you'd need in television (proved that wrong), and now this comes
along.  And we'll prove that wrong as well.
