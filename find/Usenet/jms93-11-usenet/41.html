<H2>Here's Info on LOSCON, where j</H2>
18 Nov 1993<PRE>     At the LosCon presentation on Thanksgiving Saturday, I'll be showing
scenes from upcoming shows, one nifty out-take, and "Midnight on the
Firing Line," our debut episode, *in its entirety*.  Present will be me,
story editor Larry DiTillio, and tentatively, Harlan Ellison and several
of our cast members.  They've given us the biggest room at the con, but
it's already looking like it's going to be packed to the rafters, so I
would suggest that anyone attending show up early...when we screened the
B5 pilot at last year's LosCon, its west coast debut, there was nearly a
mini-riot over seating.
