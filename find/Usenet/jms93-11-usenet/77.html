<H2>Re: B5 at LosCon</H2>
29 Nov 1993<PRE>     What you and the others seem to be pointing out is what I've been
trying -- imperfectly, as best I can -- to communicate for some time.  In
the case of "Midnight," can you follow that show and enjoy it absolutely
on its own terms?  I believe that is the case.  There's another level
there, the "little clues and hints" you mention, which will just skate
past most casual viewers and not in any way interfere with their viewing
of the episode...but if you're paying attention, and you catch them, it
adds a new level.  The more you see, the more you begin to perceive that
second level.  It's a cumulative effect that doesn't diminish the single
episodes as stand-alones.
