19 Nov 1993<PRE>     "The pilot wasn't good.  Face it!"
 
     I'm at the head of the line to point out flaws in the pilot.  Flaws
that we've dealt with.  But a) it still holds up, and b) you are trying to
make your opinion into *fact*.  It ain't.  An awful lot of people liked
the pilot a lot.  To them, it was good.  Maybe to you, it wasn't, but
that's only true for you.  That you may think persimmon yoghurt is the
best flavor ever created doesn't make it true for everybody else.  Just a
moment for perspective here....
