<H2>Re: Babylon 5</H2>
23 Nov 1993<PRE>     The bathroom scene was written, but shifted back a bit because we
decided to go for some different sets, and felt that the money could be
used better there.  We have an *amazing* number of sets as it is; 16
standing sets and another 10 or so swing sets.  So we'll either do that
scene later in the season, or wait until season two, and a fresh
construction budget.
