<H2>Famous people</H2>
21 Nov 1993<PRE>     We're doing a few things in that area, mainly background stuff,
using a consistent news network (Interstellar Network News, ISN), building
up a picture about politics back home; the problem is that when someone
says, "Did you see Ross Perot on TV last night?", we have a shared
societal understanding of who Perot is.  That carries more meaning than
just a random name.  But I take your point; it's something we've done a
little, and don't mind expanding if we can avoid getting obscure.
