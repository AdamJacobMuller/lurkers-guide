<H2>Walter Koenig on QVC</H2>
21 Nov 1993<PRE>     Darn, I missed Walter's appearance on QVC; e it.
As for when you can expect to see me on QVC...never.  That just isn't
something I care to get into.  Merchandising is fine and inevitable, but
I think that if you get too into it, it begins to change your direction a
bit.
