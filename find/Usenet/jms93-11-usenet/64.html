23 Nov 1993<PRE>     You're right; the events of the Line are something that Sinclair
doesn't much like talking about, and has been advised *against* talking
about.  When the Minbari surrendered, Earth put the best possible spin on
it, tried to make the survivors of the Line look like heroes, but there's
a general sense of what happened.  And a great deal of dismay over it.
