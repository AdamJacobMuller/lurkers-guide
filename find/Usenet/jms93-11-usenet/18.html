<H2>Re: Trek vs. B5</H2>
8 Nov 1993<PRE>     The other problem with "Twin Peaks," of course, is that they opened
up a lot of questions, but never *really* answered any of them.  In B5,
every question we ask, will be answered.
 
                                                                   jms
 
     (I would also, btw, not characterize B5 as a "mystery" series; like
Casablanca, it's a character-based story which uses intrigue and mystery
to heighten the characters.)
