<H2>Re: Re-runs of Capt. Power?</H2>
17 Nov 1993<PRE>     I liked POWER as well.  Quite a lot.  We did some good work.  But it
has this rep for being violent, there was a lot of controversy around it,
and thus far, at least insofar as I know, there's been no movement by the
skiffy channel or anyone else to pick up that one season.
