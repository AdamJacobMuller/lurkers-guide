<H2>Re: Story Ideas Problem</H2>
19 Nov 1993<PRE>     The whole idea as to what constitutes an idea, and what constitutes
a story, is fuzzy.  And the sad reality is that one need not be able to
win a case in order to *file* a case.  And fighting a lawsuit can cost
upwards of $100,000, which is usually unrecoverable.  It's just an
increasingly ugly situation.
