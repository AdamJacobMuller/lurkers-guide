<H2>Re: Series plot, was Re: Trek</H2>
23 Nov 1993<PRE>     I never said that the commander's intent wasn't to set up Sinclair; I
only said that he wasn't there to *kill* Sinclair.  That aspect of making
Sinclair the patsy was very much part of the thing.
 
	  (Oops, just realized that I mis-typed; that should be "I never said
that the ASSASSIN'S intent wasn't to set up Sinclair," not "the
commander's intent."  Slip of the tongue.
