<H2>Re: Starfury launch error in c</H2>
6 Nov 1993<PRE>     Yes, this is what we were going for.  The use of outward force to
push the fighters away from the station (rotational force) has nothing to
do with catapulting the ships, it's just a low-fuel, high-economy way of
getting the ships away by taking advantage of the station's rotation, so
they can fire their engines at a safe distance from the station.  It's the
fastest way overall to launch a whole bunch of fighters while leaving the
primary docking bay clear for larger ships.
