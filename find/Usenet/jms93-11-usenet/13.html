<H2>Re: Trek vs. B5</H2>
5 Nov 1993<PRE>     Once again, there's a lot of false analogies here in any attempt to
compare pilots, as in this TOS and B5 thread.  You're talking about
transporters and other *technological* items.  And you're right, they
didn't explain their tech.  Neither did we, with the exception of the
changling net in the pilot, and only because it was a plot point.  We
didn't explain how the jump gates worked, how centrifugal force kept the
gravity in place, or any of that.
 
     The difference isn't *technology*, it's *context*.  Once again, B5 is
in many ways a *political* story.  Consequently it's necessary to explain
who the players are in some detail, something that ST didn't have to
worry about.  If you're reading a political thriller about the U.S. and
the (now defunct) USSR, it helps a lot to know who's who.
 
     Also, when ST started, there wasn't really a clear agenda, a place
that they were going, story-wise.  B5 is a novel for TV.  And that puts
on some pressures and problems other shows don't have.  Others may not
see it that way, but it isn't their call.  It's my call, and I stand
behind it, even while seeing some of the flaws in the pilot.
 
     All of which again points up the...well, *pointlessness* of trying
to compare the two shows.  Compare MASH to ALL IN THE FAMILY.  They're
both comedies.  The similarity ends there.  Everything doesn't have to
be comparable or dissectable (to coin a term) in reference to ST.
