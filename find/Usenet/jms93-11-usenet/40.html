<H2>Will B-5 be a "cartoon"?</H2>
18 Nov 1993<PRE>     I don't have anything to do with the promos, for the most part,
don't make the promos, and in this case still haven't seen this
particular promo.  Sometimes I think they stress the action aspect more
than the character stuff, because it's easier to blow out action in 15 to
30 seconds than character.
