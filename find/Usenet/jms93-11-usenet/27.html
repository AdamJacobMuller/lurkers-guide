<H2>Master plan, was Re: Trek vs.</H2>
16 Nov 1993<PRE>     I approached B5 with the theory that *every episode* must be able to
stand completely alone, and be appreciated completely on its own terms.  If
you never saw another episode of B5, you got a solid hour's entertainment
out of it.  It's only as you see more episodes that you gradually become
aware of a much larger story going on here.
