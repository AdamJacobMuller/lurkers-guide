<H2>Open response to Mr. Straczyns</H2>
23 Nov 1993<PRE>     So let me get this straight...your problem is that I have moments
when I'm cheerful, and polite...and moments when, fatigued by 20 hour days,
I sometimes get a little sharper than I might like.  Okay, I'm human.  So
what?
 
     Your other problem, at the center of this, is that I don't behave the
way YOU think I should behave.  Once again...so what?  I don't HAVE to
fit your definition.  I didn't fight all these years to find my own voice,
and become my own person, and produce my own show, only to worry about
whether I fit Rob's picture of a perfect person.  I'm sorry, but I have
substantially more interesting things to worry about.
 
     You use the word "sophmoric" a lot.  I could just as easily turn
that around.  I could sit and dissect your messages, what I think you are
by your language choice, approach, and similar subjects.  But you state,
"You don't know how I (Rob) am, where I came from, or my background; I'd
also rather not bring it up."  Curious how you seem to feel that YOU are
off-limits to speculation, but others aren't...even though we're both
on the nets.
 
     This discussion, absent your unsubstantiated allegations, is rather
pointless.  I am who I am, I behave the way I behave.  You don't like it.
 I don't like your behavior or your tendency to stick your nose in my
psyche and engage in some long-distance dime-store psychoanalysis, for
which you are neither qualified nor welcome.
 
     That's showbiz.
