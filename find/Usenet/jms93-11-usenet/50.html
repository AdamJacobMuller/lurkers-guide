<H2>JMS' demons</H2>
21 Nov 1993<PRE>     An interesting bit of demonology.  And there is certainly some
measure of validity to it.  A story is only as good as the questions that
it answers.  The writer's job is to always ask the next question.  The
problem is as often in finding the right question as it is in finding the
right response.  One thing I've discovered in something like 10 years of
net-surfing is that I'm always surprised.  And in the case of B5, there
have been many questions raised, many challenges made, for which I didn't
have immediate, ready answers.  It's forced me to think about things and
come up with answers I didn't know I needed until the question was posed.
 All things considered, it's been a valuable and educational experience.
