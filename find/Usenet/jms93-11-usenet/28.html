<H2>Re: B5's Weapons</H2>
16 Nov 1993<PRE>     You want helium gas bursts when the PPG is fired?  You want it to
look more like projectile weaponry when fired?  You want recoil?  You want
the impact to diminish over distance?  You want the kind of sound you
would get if something that superheated burst through a section of the
air?
 
     Guess what?  You got it.  That's *exactly* how a PPG operates.
