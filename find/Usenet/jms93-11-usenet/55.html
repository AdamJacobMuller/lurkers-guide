<H2>Re: Here's Info on LOSCON, whe</H2>
21 Nov 1993<PRE>     As an advisory, in addition to me, story editor Larry DiTillio, and
tentatively Harlan Ellison, we've confirmed that Michael O'Hare, Mira
Furlan, and Peter Jurasik will be at the LosCon presentation next
Saturday.  More names may be added to that.
 
     I request that I will make at the presentation, and which I'll set up
here, is to minimize any kind of spoiler discussion of the episode until
it airs.  It's two months to airdate, and we'd like some parts of the show
to be a surprise to the viewers.  General reactions are great, but if we
could keep spoiler-type discussions to a minimum, I'd be very happy.
