<H2>Re: Lifespan of a Centauri / h</H2>
3 Nov 1993<PRE>     We're using a tachyon communications system to handle the FTL problem
regarding communications.  As for the coloration of the jump gate (if
we're talking about the same thing), the wave effect is red-shifted when
you enter the jump gate, and blue-shifted when coming out.  I think we
had that slightly out of phase in the pilot; it's since been corrected to
match correct red-shift.
