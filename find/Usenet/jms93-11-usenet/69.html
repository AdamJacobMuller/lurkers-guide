<H2>Query to JMS on a minor point</H2>
23 Nov 1993<PRE>     I've noticed the same thing; he blinks when he wants to, and refuses
to let go of you the rest of the time.  We've also given him a LOT more
to do of a character-based nature, and I think people are going to be
very pleased in what they see.  The problem with the role of commander is
that it's the toughest one in the bunch...he has to be firm and
commanding, but vulnerable...able to be angry, but compassionate...ready
to fight but just as ready for affection...and I think that what was shown
of the pilot (minus the nearly half-hour that was cut) only really showed
one side.  We're showing a lot more now, and Michael's doing a hell of a
job carrying it all.
