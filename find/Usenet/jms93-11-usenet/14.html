<H2>Re: Trek vs. B5</H2>
5 Nov 1993<PRE>     The first one-hour episode of the series, "Midnight on the Firing
Line," does a fair amount of re-introduction, for those who've seen the
pilot and need to be up to speed, and some introducing for those who
haven't.  It is, however, largely an action-oriented story, into which we
weave the characterization.  It manages to convey some of the same info as
the pilot, but in a *much* more dramatic fashion.
