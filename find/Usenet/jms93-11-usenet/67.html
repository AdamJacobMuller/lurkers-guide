<H2>Re: jms's "attitude"</H2>
23 Nov 1993<PRE>     You have now made several charges of nepotism against me.  If we all
speak the same langauge, then nepotism is hiring people not qualified to
do a particular job because they're cronies or relatives.  If someone is
eminently qualified to do the job, it's not nepotism.  If the person is
neither a friend nor a relative, it's not nepotism.
 
     Please cite to me one single instance in which I have engaged in this
kind of behavior, or withdraw your allegation.
