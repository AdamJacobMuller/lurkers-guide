<H2>Making of Babylon 5 -document?</H2>
25 Nov 1993<PRE>     There have been several behind-the-scenes pieces cut already; one at
8 minutes, slated mainly toward potential advertisers, has already gone
out on the downlink.  At some point a 12 and 30 minute piece will go out.
 When that happens, I don't know.
 
     It's been sold overseas, to Channel 4 in the U.K., but don't have the
specifics yet on other markets.
