17 Nov 1993<PRE>     Re: "Universe Today," my feeling was that there are specialized
editions beamed out to various places...the Mars Colony gets one with
stories skewed to their interest, and so on.  Including B5, since it's a
major port.  The issues are printed on recycled material; finish a copy,
dump it in a drop, and it's put out again the next day.  Synthetic
material.
