<H2>Re: B5 at LosCon</H2>
29 Nov 1993<PRE>     (Lost the last paragraph of my message.)  In any event, what I'm
striving for is the idea that you can watch the episodes for the
character stories, OR the story arc, OR the individual stories, OR all
three at the same time, all in the same exact episodes.  You can get out
as much as you're willing to find.
 
     It's a very weird kind of writing...but at least on this end, it's
kinda fun, actually.
