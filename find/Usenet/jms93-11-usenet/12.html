<H2>Re: Trek vs. B5</H2>
4 Nov 1993<PRE>     "Would it be fair to compare the original ST pilot to B5's pilot?"
 
     No, it would not.  Because there is nothing in common with them other
than that they are both SF.  You can compare TNG to DS9 to TOS, because
they're in the same universe.
 
     Would it be fair to compare Cagney and Lacey with NYPD Blue?  After
all, they're both cop shows.  But in fact, they're not the same kind of
cop show; they share the same genre, but there ends the overlap.  The two
shows are distinct, separate entities, just as Harlan Ellison's work is
distinct from Bill Gibson's work, even though both incorprorate elements
of SF.
 
     The ST pilot existed in its own universe, and was primarily an action
show.  The B5 pilot exists in its own universe, and primarily sets the
stage for a political mystery/intrigue series.  It wasn't meant to serve
the same functions as the ST pilot.
 
     It seems to me that many SF fans continue to compare everything to
ST because that's their primary frame of reference, and they continue to
apply it whether it's relevant or not.  My suggestion...get another frame
of reference.
