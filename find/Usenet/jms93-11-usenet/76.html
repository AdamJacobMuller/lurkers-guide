<H2>Re: Query to JMS on a minor po</H2>
25 Nov 1993<PRE>     At this point, I suspect that the only version of the pilot that will
ever be released (barring major success on our part) is the one that's now
in distribution.  Making a new version with the missing 25 minutes would
require massive editing (there was never a full version made, since we're
editing on computer file graphics, only going to film when we're done), and
right now that's not in anyone's budget.
