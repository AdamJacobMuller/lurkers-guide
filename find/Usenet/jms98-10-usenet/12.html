<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Top Cow?!</H2>
27 Oct 1998<PRE>&gt;How closely do you plan 
&gt;on collaborating with your penciller--will he have much leeway in 
&gt;layouts/"camera" angles/etc. or do you script a page pretty tightly?

I script pretty damn tight...as much as a half-page to describe a panel, in
great detail.  I'm doing those pages the same as I do my B5 and Crusade
scripts: hideous amounts of detail.

And yeah, we want to go for a much more realistic look to this book, because
it's essential to making the story work.

&gt;if you seriously plan on bucking the System and 
&gt;producing a book that operates on the assumption that dialogue and 
&gt;characters are *not* interchangeable, I can guarantee you at least one 
&gt;regular reader.

Done and done.
