&gt;How much of the CGI could be done "speculatively", concurrent
&gt;or even before the filming of the episode?

Zip.  Because until it's edited, you don't know how long to make the shots, or
how they'll intercut with the live action...and there's all the stuff from
other eps to deal with as well.
