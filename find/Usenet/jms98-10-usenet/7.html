13 Oct 1998<PRE>&gt;BTW how are you planning those CGI parts? Are you providing exact
&gt;storyboards with ships and beams or do the CGI people just create
&gt;something along your script or do you check it prior rendering in
&gt;wireframe form or similar

Pretty much all of the above, depending on the complexity of the sequence.
