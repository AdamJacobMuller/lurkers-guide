27 Oct 1998<PRE>&gt;I'm not "tearing it down" as you put it.  I am simply
&gt;pointing out the fact that the idea is not original.
&gt;In fact, it sounds like a direct copy from the films,
&gt;although I'm sure JMS will make a LOT more
&gt;interesting story of it than the films.
&gt;

Sorry.  Ain't the case.  Damned was about a colonization effort by aliens,
achieved by getting human female pregnant, and the kids were strictly
telekinetic, and died at about age 7.

There is no alien colonization thing going on in the story, it only affects the
women who are already pregnant, and it follows their whole lives.  You may as
well say that the Three Mile Island story is a Damned story because it charts
the effect of outside forces on pregnant women and their offspring.
