<H2>quickie update from jms</H2>
21 Oct 1998<PRE>To the gazillion or so folks who've asked in email...yes, we began shooting
again on Monday the 19th, as scheduled, making the show we desired to make, and
we're cranking along just fine.  Actors are happy, crew are happy, everybody
happy but Zathras...but Zathras never happy...Zathras happy once, had friend
once, but wheels fell off, very sad....
