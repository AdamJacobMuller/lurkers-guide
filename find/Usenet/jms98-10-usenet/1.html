<H2>Re: JMS: Anti-VORcon?</H2>
8 Oct 1998<PRE>
It should be noted that both Sierra FX and Precedence Publishing are taking
steps to make it clear that while they are sponsoring *events* at the
convention, they do not *endorse* this partuicular convention, distancing
themselves from it.  Signs will appear at their booths further reinforcing
this.

Additionally, Tracy Scoggins will not appear, Bruce may or may not be there
depending on what happens with a movie he's shooting in Toronto, Optic Nerve
will not be bringing down an exhibit, and WB is this week putting VorCon on
official notice about the showing of ANY copyrighted videotape material from
the show.
