<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Top Cow?!</H2>
27 Oct 1998<PRE>I'd actually heard a lot of good things about Top Cow, and my understanding
going into this was that I would have total creative freedom, and it would be a
writer-driven book.  The artist they've talked to is someone whose work I've
admired, and this book is going to have a very different look from the rest of
their titles.  The folks over there seem to really have their act together. 
They only launch about 2 new titles a year, and that means they have to be
special...and they want this to be that kind of project.
