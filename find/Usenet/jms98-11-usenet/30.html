<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Your opinion of your work</H2>
25 Nov 1998<PRE>&gt;I don't intend to sound like I'm placing you on a pedestal but do you think
&gt;that in years to come film and language students of all ages will study
&gt;Babylon 5 In the same way that our generation studies the works of
&gt;Shakespear and even the authors you have paid homage to, such as George
&gt;Orswell and Isaac Asimov? The deep and complex storyline I think warrants a
&gt;fair bit of academic analysis.
&gt;
&gt;
Actually, that's already started.  A number of academic essays on B5 have been
collected in "The Parliament of Dreams," published in the UK (I think someone
here may have the info on purchasing it).  I found in reading it that I was
smarter, stupider, more liberal, more conservative, more progressive, more
reactionary, than I had previously imagined.

Such analysis (and it was/is good reading, btw) is flattering, sometimes
daunting, but brings out stuff always worth considering.  Whether the subject
matter is in the long run truly worth the ink, only history can tell. 
Obviously I think so, but again, I have a vested interest in saying that.
