<H2>Re: Putting Money into JMS's Pocket</H2>
30 Nov 1998<PRE>&gt;Is there a B5 video sales outlet through which more money is put
&gt;directly into your pocket compared to others?
&gt;
&gt;Thought you should reap more of the $800+ I will be spending as official
&gt;videos are released.

No...it may come as a surprise, but I don't get a direct cut in any way of the
sales of videotapes (for whatever reason, Hollywood doesn't consider that
merchandising, so I don't get it that way).  The only thing I get -- thanks to
a wonderfully short-sighted WGA contract covering cassettes --  is the standard
writer's royalty, which comes after the distributer gets his money back...which
means you get zip for the most part.
