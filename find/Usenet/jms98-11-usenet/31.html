26 Nov 1998<PRE>&gt;Remember, though, that those instructions were given in a season 5 episode,
&gt;after Sleeping In Light was filmed.  They wouldn't go out of their way to
&gt;refer
&gt;to a script that hadn't even been written.  And a Neil Gaiman script at that.

Actually, in that scene, Neil didn't write Kosh's message.  He asked what it
would be, and I gave him that, knowing that I'd been looking for a way to slip
that in as early as season 4.
