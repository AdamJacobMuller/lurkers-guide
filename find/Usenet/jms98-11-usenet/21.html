<H2>Re: Attn JMS: Start date for Crusade?</H2>
20 Nov 1998<PRE>Because 108 is now the slated fist episode, so that we can use it to introduce
the new characters rather than jump in in-progress, it means it will take
longer to complete the CGI and stuff than 103, since it was shot later.  TNT
needs the eps a month or two prior ot airdate for critics...and there's the
concern about showing only 4 episodes in March (which is when it would all be
rady) and thenbeing cut off for 8 weeks by the NBA playoffs.

So they figured going June 2nd would avoid all of the problems, and put the
show out when the network shows were in reruns...meaning it has a better chance
of scoring large numbers, a strategy that worked well with other shows like
90210.
