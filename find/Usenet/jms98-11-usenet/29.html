25 Nov 1998<PRE>Thanks....

&gt;Some people on the TNT boards have expressed some doubt about Crusade. 
&gt;And who can blame them?  It's hard for us mere mortals to imagine anyone
&gt;outdoing B5, even you.  But I think you can do it.  I don't think you've
&gt;exhausted your creativity just yet

Folks had the same doubts before B5 hit the air.  I'm used to it.
