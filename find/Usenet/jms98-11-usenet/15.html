&gt;earlier this year, you talked about a "B5"
&gt;episode where Bruce Boxleitner says the line "I'm going to miss this
&gt;place".  You then became so emotional, you had to leave the set.  Since
&gt;Bruce says the same line in "Objects in Motion", is this when it
&gt;happened? 

It's in the next one.
