<H2>Re: Attn JMS: Who's Fiona Avery?</H2>
5 Nov 1998<PRE>Fiona came aboard as our continuity editor to help keep all of the B5 licensing
stuff as canon as humanly possible.  So that means learning all she can about
the B5 and Crusade universes, second probably only to me.  

A couple of months ago or so, she wrote a spec Crusade script just to see if
she could do it, as an experiment, never intended or figured we'd buy it.  I
read it...and walked into John Copeland's office and said, "Am I nuts, or is
this as good as I think it is?"  He read it, said it was great...and we bought
it, plus one more.
