<H2>Re: Hey joe!!!  teleplay????</H2>
12 Nov 1998<PRE>&gt;I've noticed that you have been
&gt;co-writting some of these eps with Harlen.. but in the opening credits it
&gt;also
&gt;says teleplay by J. Michael Straczynski (my apologies if I just botched your
&gt;name)  so whats a teleplay??? and why all of a sudden are you making use of
&gt;one???  

There are two parts of writing an episode: the basic storyline, sometimes
presented as an outline, and then the actual script which is a more specific
elaboration on that story.  Story is, "King John and Queen Mary live in the
castle and they have a hard night between them."

Script is: 

EXT. CASTLE - NIGHT
We see the banners unfurling in the breeze, and go to

INT. CASTLE - NIGHT
KING JOHN and QUEEN MARY are in bed.  He's awake, she's sleeping.  He looks up
at the ceiling. 

                                  KING JOHN
                 Why me?  Of all the gin joints and
                 castles in England, why did she have
                 to step into mine?
