17 Nov 1998<PRE>The series is available on widescreen; in PAL format for overseas.  It would
apparently cost WB about $1500 per ep to convert to NTSC, and they don't want
to spend the money.  Absent that, the Image release will be the best release in
the best form currently available, and I commend it highly.
