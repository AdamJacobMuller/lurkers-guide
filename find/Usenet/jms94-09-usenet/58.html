<H2>Re: B5 reminds me of...</H2>
9 Sep 1994<PRE>     I wish it were true about Twin Peaks having an overall story that
they had planned out prior to filming.  Just recently, though, I had
meetings with a couple of main writers/story editors on the show, and
they said, yeah, they were making it all up as they went, they really
didn't have a clue where it was going.  There was a general sort of theme,
but as for having the story plotted out...apparently not.  Needless to
say, I was vastly disappointed...I loved that show...still do, actually,
even knowing this.
