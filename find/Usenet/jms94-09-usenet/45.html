<H2>JMS: Ad lib or not ad lib?</H2>
8 Sep 1994<PRE>     When it came time for that chant, nothing had been scripted; it was
supposed to be a soft, under one's breath kind of chant.  Bill came and
asked me and Larry if we had anything in mind.  We said no, whatever you
decide is fine...and he ended up chanting his album cover.
 
     Later...*much*...laater...when I discovered this, we discussed it at
some length.
