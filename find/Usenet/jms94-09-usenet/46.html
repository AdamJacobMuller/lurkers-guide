<H2>JMS: Re: B5 &amp; Violence: Light</H2>
8 Sep 1994<PRE>     "B5 does respectfully acknowledge religion, and is therefore not as
liable to get bit by this group."
 
     Oh, they'll still gig us on violence; already have.  John Copeland,
one of our producers, heard an NPR report a while back interviewing some
rep of one of these pressure groups who complained about the violence;
more will come.  And any group NOT represented will scream and yell
because they think they're not being represented.  And given some other
aspects of our show...oh, yeah, they'll come after us all right.
 
     Where nothing exists, they'll just make it up.  When I was working
with ABC on The Real Ghostbusters, a consulting group came in from one of
these groups, to help the network avoid accidental satanic references, and
to keep an eye on this stuff.  They gave the network execs their breakdown
of the signs that a kid was getting into satanism.  Some of them (and
this is verbatim): "He's curious.  He's sometimes sad.  He's easily
pressured by his peers.  He's into heavy metal rock and roll.  He can
sometimes be rebellious."
 
     By their lights, those are guaranteed signs of satanism.
 
     Not come after *us*...?  Oh, man....
