<H2>Why use real paper?</H2>
9 Sep 1994<PRE>     Paper (or synthetics) is light, foldable, portable, disposable and
recycleable.  I remember being told that the coming of computers would
put an end to paper...come on by my office someday...I have MORE paper
and MORE drafts lying around now than when I was working on a typewriter.
