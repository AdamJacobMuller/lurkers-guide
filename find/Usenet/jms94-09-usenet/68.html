14 Sep 1994<PRE>     If we put a blue screen behind the window, and did that, given that
we tend to have long scenes in front of it, every frame of starfield has
to be rendered, cut in digitally...it's a *very* time consuming process,
and would detract from Ron &amp; Co. doing the other EFX we use in the show.
We don't have the ability to throw money at everything here.
