<H2>Mind of the [Great] Maker</H2>
16 Sep 1994<PRE>     Marc: when being interviewed about my presence on the nets, some
reporter will invariably work his or her way around to the question,
"Yeah, but what do YOU get out of it?"  The answer to that could not be
expressed any better than in my response to your analysis.  One of the
wonders of being on the nets is that from time to time one will encounter
a cogent, reasoned, thoughtful and perceptive analysis that comes at
one's own creation from a totally unexpected direction, casting it in a
new light.  Yours was such a message.  Many thanks.

                                                                    jms
