<H2>Don't Unveil Kosh</H2>
22 Sep 1994<PRE>     I think it would be profoundly unfair to viewers to keept hem
(oops, keep them) hanging around for more than one more season waiting
to see a Vorlon.  Though I understand and see your point.

                                                                     jms
