16 Sep 1994<PRE>     Virtually ALL dramatic series cost at or above the $1 million mark.
A show as simple and cost effective as "Murder, She Wrote," without any
CGI or models or big efx, with recurring cast and sets and not a lot of
location shooting, cost around $1.2 million per episode.

                                                                         jms
