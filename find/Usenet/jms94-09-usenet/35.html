<H2>Re: You guys read Alfred Beste</H2>
5 Sep 1994<PRE>     The direction and intent and background of the Psi Corps is *very*
different from Bester's "The Demolished Man."  What may cause some of
the confusion is that when I decided to name the Psi Cop we'll be seeing,
knowing of Alfie's work in the genre in general, and knowing that he was
a close friend of Harlan's, I decided it would be a nice testimony to the
man to name the Psi Cop Bester.  There's nothing beyond that.
