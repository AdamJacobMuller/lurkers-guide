<H2>Re: The Gathering did not win</H2>
5 Sep 1994<PRE>     I think a large part of this debate will be determined by which
episodes fall into the right dates for eligibility.  I think that, for
instance, David Gerrold's "Believers" fell just on the other side of Hugo
eligibility for this coming year.  Which means that (if I'm correct, and
is someone could check that'd be great) only shows prior to that would be
eligible.  The only real big ones in that bunch would be "And the Sky Full
of Stars" and "Mind War."  Best bet may be to pick one of those two and
focus there.
 
     One interesting sidelight is that B5 is *very* popular in the UK,
including Scotland, so it may have a fair chance.
 
                                                                    jms
 
     (And the TNG finale isn't eligible this year, I think, having conme
(come) in after the cutoff date.)
