<H2>JMS: Thanks</H2>
22 Sep 1994<PRE>     Two responses: on your B5 comments...thanks, much appreciated.

     Regarding the new Twilight Zone...I saw the same article you did on
why MGM chose to make one more season, to have enough to syndicate, and
was *furious* by it.  Yeah, MGM did it because if they *didn't*, there
wouldn't be enough episodes to syndicate, and they would never again see
the light of day.  The article seemed to make a big deal out of the idea
that they were doing this so they could make some of their money back.

     Well (and this isn't directed at you, as much as the article), I
hate to break anybody's bubble, but NONE of the studios produce TV series
because they think they're doing something good for the commonweal.  They
do so because they think the show will make money for them.  It's then up
to the writers and producers to try and make it something MORE than that.

     The article was skewed and biased and snotty, and I'm *still* pissed
off about it.

                                                                      jms
