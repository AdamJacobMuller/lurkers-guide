<H2>Re: B5 &amp; Violence: Light Years</H2>
5 Sep 1994<PRE>     Re: "The Man Who Corrupted Hadleyburg," I will confess to being a
bit of a Twain enthusiast/scholar (if I can abuse that latter term for a
moment in a burst of unjustificed optimism).  I've read virtually
everything the man ever wrote, up to and including his journals, which are
fascinating on their own, albeit fragmented (for obvious reasos).  He
even wrote many stories that could be considered SF/fantasy outside of
"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court."  I find myself quoting him
frequently.  The man knew how to turn a phrase and make a point.
