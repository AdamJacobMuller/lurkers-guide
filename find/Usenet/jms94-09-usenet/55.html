9 Sep 1994<PRE>      Re: the "last" of the Babylon Stations...y'all might want to bear
in mind the syntax of the narration.  It speaks of B5 in the *past
tense*.  "Bablyon 5 WAS the last of the Babylon stations...it WAS the
dawn of the third age of mankind."  The narration is the voice of future
history, the storyteller, long after the fact, spinning for us the tale
of the last of the Babylon stations.
