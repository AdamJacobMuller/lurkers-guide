<H2>Re: WE WON THE EMMY FOR BEST M</H2>
11 Sep 1994<PRE>     The Special Effects Emmy generally reflects the work over the course
of a season.  TNG submitted something like 6-8 episodes, ditto with other
series.  Through a situation best left unexamined, only one B5 was
submitted, "Sky," whereas "Mind War," also eligible, was not submitted.
There wasn't enough to work from to make the determination to give B5 th3
(the) award (there are no nominations in this category, only 3-4 juried
awards).  This will be corrected next season.  In spades.
