<H2>ATTN JMS (part III)  More Neve</H2>
25 Sep 1994<PRE>     We'll see more on Talia's additional talents in year two.

     Yes, that is a triluminary on the grey council staff in "Sky."

     No current plans for Ben Zayn to reprise.

     Did I say something about the development of psi talent...?

     The rest will have to wait.
