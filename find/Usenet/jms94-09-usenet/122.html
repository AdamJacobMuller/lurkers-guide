<H2>Re: Truth on Ohare &lt;offical&gt;</H2>
30 Sep 1994<PRE>     Michael O'Hare had *absolutely* no such "in-first-episode, so in for
all" clause in his contract.  Not only that, but insofar as I know such
clauses don't *exist* in ANY SAG contract.  This in particular is one of
the most astonishingly stupid things I've heard in ages.  We gave some
serious thought to having Michael in the first episode, except as I got
into the story, it really slowed things down...and I'm kinda partial to
mysteries.  I like *doing* something...and then a bit down the road you
find out what it's all about.  (Like this is news to anyone here.)

     And Sinclair *does* appear later on this season.
