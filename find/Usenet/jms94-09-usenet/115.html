<H2>Loscon Babylon 5 Presentation</H2>
27 Sep 1994<PRE>     Well, I'm certainly glad to hear about the B5 presentation being
scheduled for that Sunday; it's the first I'd heard of it.  I hadn't been
notified or invited prior to this.  (Though in fairness, just after I
read this here, I found a note on CIS from Lyon doing just that.)  In any
event...yes, I'll be there.
