15 Sep 1994<PRE>     I want to be there when someone informs Mr. Pavlocik that the new
Voyager series has contracted with Amblin' Imaging to do all of its space
effects (except for the main ship) with CGI by way of Amigas/Toasters.

                                                                        jms
