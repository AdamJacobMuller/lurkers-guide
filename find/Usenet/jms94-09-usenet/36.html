<H2>JMS: Three quick questions...</H2>
5 Sep 1994<PRE>     No, actually, B2 was structured for maximum jarring effect, thus the
sudden cuts back and forth, the sickly green light in B4...makes the
person watching feel unexplainably anxious, which was a subliminal but
definite intent.  So no, nothing much was cut.  And yes, eventually we
will see the flip-side of the B4 story.
