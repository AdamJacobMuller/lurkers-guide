<H2>Morden = Rod Serling?</H2>
24 Sep 1994<PRE>     You noticed that too, huh?  Surprise me, too.  We'd cast him in the
part of Morden, then the first day's dailies come in, and his stance, his
manner, the way he looks...we all looked at the TV and said, more or less
at once, "Holy shit, it's Rod Serling!"
