18 Sep 1994<PRE>     Doing a story in weekly arcs is really the only way to do it in what
is a standard dramatic TV format, airing every 7 days.  On another level,
the episodes aren't as tightly linked as a novel, because if so, then you
couldn't afford to miss even one of them.  We try to be more flexible.

     And loved "Tales from the City."
