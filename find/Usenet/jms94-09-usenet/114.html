<H2>How is Claudia?</H2>
26 Sep 1994<PRE>     Thanks; Ivanova's a lot of fun to write for. Re: Claudia...she's
up and running around, though still wearing her cast.  We worked it into
the script following the one she was shooting when it happened, and shot
around her for the balance of that.  It's come up in a total of two
episodes in dialogue, but otherwise hasn't affected the show; she's been
great about it.
