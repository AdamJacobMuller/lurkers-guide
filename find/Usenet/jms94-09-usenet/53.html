<H2>ATTN JMS: B5 baseball caps</H2>
9 Sep 1994<PRE>      Well, see, here's the problem: yes, Creation licensed some stuff
from us, including the creation (so to speak) of B5 baseball caps.  So
far, so good.
 
      One day, about a week or so ago, John Copeland comes into my
office with one of these caps, purchased at a Creation store in
Glendale.  Shows it to me.  The stitching ain't great (they're supposed
to run these things past me, and I didn't see this item), but the cap is
more or less okay, I don't see why he's smiling.
 
      Then the label attached to the cap swings out, and hangs in front
of my eyes.  OFFICIAL LICENSED PRODUCT PARAMOUNT TELEVISION.
 
      I went ballistic, Warners went ballistic, the caps were yanked out
of the stores so fast they left a doppler trail behind them...so I don't
know now if they'll be around for sale or not.  If so, I doubt very much
that you'll see a Paramount tag on them.
 
                                                                 jms
