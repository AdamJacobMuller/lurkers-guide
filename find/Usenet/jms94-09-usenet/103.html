<H2>JMS: Earthdome question</H2>
24 Sep 1994<PRE>     Earthdome is in what was once Geneva, and is a domed city similar to
some of what's done on Mars, though here it's to protect the city from
outside threat.  We mainly hear about it because that's where B5's
political, military and social ties are, but I'd like to expand outside of
that...hear what's new in New York, that sort of thing (though we have
heard references to the Russian Consortium, and to poor old San Diego...).
