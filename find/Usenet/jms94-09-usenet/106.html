<H2>Next on Geraldo-- Is Morden Re</H2>
24 Sep 1994<PRE>     Morden tried to find out what the ambassadors would like.  Morden
arranged to rescue an important Centauri artifact.  Morden helped wipe out
the crooks.  Morden saved Londo's career, and asked for nothing in return.

     And yet we get the sense that Morden is a bad guy.

     Kosh destroys our chance for immortality.  Refuses to get involved
in the affairs of others.  Is plainly studying us.  Terrorizes one of our
main characters, Talia, for unknown reasons.

     And yet we get the sense that Kosh is a good guy.

     If anyone should ask, I really *love* writing this show....
