<H2>Re: Bored of Trek, try B5!</H2>
18 Sep 1994<PRE>     Correct, Gregory.  One of the things we learned from the pilot was
that we shoved too much information at people too fast.  So I deliberately
held back a lot of arc stuff in the beginning of the series, allowing
people to move gradually into the B5 universe, learn more about it, and
THEN start whapping them with the arc.  It isn't until "Mind War" and
"Sky" that we really begin cranking the arc.
