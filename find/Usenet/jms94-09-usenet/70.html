<H2>VItW Part 1 - Another Question</H2>
6 Sep 1994<PRE>     Once removed from his place, Varn was able to lead them back to their
shuttle.  It's not terribly dramatic, and I figured that was a fairly
logical leap, so didn't feel the need to put in a scene which would just
consist of VArn saying, "Left....now right...."
