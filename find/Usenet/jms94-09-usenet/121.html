<H2>Truth on Ohare &lt;offical&gt;</H2>
29 Sep 1994<PRE>     Mellissa Gilbert didn't state things exactly right, and was being
provoked by Stern to say something controversial.  O'Hare already is
slated to appear later in season one, so that alone takes care of the
issue.  I'd also suggest the current Starlog interview with Michael,
which also confirms stuff.

     (Oops, typo above, I meant to type later in season *two*.)
