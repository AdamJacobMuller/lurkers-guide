<H2>JMS: UK Censorship - Chrysalis</H2>
5 Sep 1994<PRE>     Insofar as I know, there's only one scene that might cause them a
problem for violence, but it's handled fairly discreetly...well, on
second thought, there's two...but if they did get snipped, you wouldn't
lose more than 20 seconds or so.  If this cost plot information or not
would depend on how they edited it.
