<H2>ATTN JMS: "And The Sky Full of</H2>
24 Sep 1994<PRE>     The wisp of smoke is a wisp of smoke, nothing more important than
that.  If something living in hyperspace bothers you...good, it should.
The Psi Corps article is in frame for a reason.  Yes, we sometimes put
additional or important information in the background, but I don't think
we can be fair and assume that everyone sees it, so if you don't see it
in one place, it's stated out loud later on...the background stuff is to
give the alert viewer a fighting chance to guess some stuff BEFORE it
happens; when stuff DOES finally happen, all the required information is
supplied at that time.
