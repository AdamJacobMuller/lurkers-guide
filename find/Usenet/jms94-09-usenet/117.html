<H2>ATT JMS : Question on Rules...</H2>
28 Sep 1994<PRE>     Actor suggestions are fine.  As for Chrysalis, there's about 8
to 10 days in "story time" between it and the events in "Points."  The
next few shows track in real-time.

                                                                    jms
