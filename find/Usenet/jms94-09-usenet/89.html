<H2>Question: Why only one camera</H2>
21 Sep 1994<PRE>     All shows (including ours) sometimes use two cameras (referred to as
the A and B cameras).  Adding a second camera costs money, because you
now also need a second camera operator to run it, second focus pullers,
dolly guys, on and on.  In general, all of your main footage (masters,
close-ups and the rest) are always shot with the A camera *anyway*, with
the B camera usually used for group reactions or coverage in action scenes.

                                                                   jms
