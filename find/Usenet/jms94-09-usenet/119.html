<H2>UK: B5 ratings</H2>
29 Sep 1994<PRE>     There's some chance that I may be in London within a week or so of
"Chrysalis" airing there.  Anything I should know about, any London
conventions?  How's the weather out there this time of year (October)?
Anything doing in London that's worth checking out?  (Plays in
particular.)
