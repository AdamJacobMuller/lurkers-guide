<H2>JMS: Minor Roles--Great Job!!</H2>
8 Sep 1994<PRE>     There are a number of security guard types we see frequently; one
who is Asian, the dark-haired guy who we saw in "Sky" that you note (and
who we also have seen elsewhere, including the picket crashers in "By
Any Means"), and Lou Welch, who shows up from time to time, and continues
into the next season.  They all continue to show up.
