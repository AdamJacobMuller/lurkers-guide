<H2>Harlan Ellison</H2>
4 Sep 1994<PRE>     The book is Harlan's autobiography, which he plans to write around
the year 2000, and yes, that's his photo.  (He borrowed the prop when we
were finished and casually carried it with him to a few places, just to
make people nuts thinking there was a book out they'd missed....)
