<H2>Re: A "promotion" for Ivanova?</H2>
24 Sep 1994<PRE>     Major Krantz wasn't so much in charge of B4 as he was (as noted in
dialogue) assigned to oversee the final stages of construction.  His job
was to get the station finished, then turn it over to someone else to
run.

                                                                        jms
