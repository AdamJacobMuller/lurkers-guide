<H2>Attn JMS: Scripts available?</H2>
14 Sep 1994<PRE>     We're in the process of setting up some kind of fan liaison office,
which would do some limited sales stuff, just enough to pay its own
way.  Should this come about, we'll sell some of the B5 scripts through
this office.  (One difference between us and ST is that we will pay the
freelance writers a *royalty* on any scripts of theirs we sell.)  But
this is still in the works.
