<H2>ATTN JMS: Warner Bros. Stores</H2>
10 Sep 1994<PRE>     In general, WB doesn't sell many TV series items through the stores;
and only sometimes via catalog.  There are several WB shows that aren't
represented at all.  (And B5 isn't produced by WB, it'san independent
production aired on a network partly owned by WB, and that's a vital
distinction to remember.)
