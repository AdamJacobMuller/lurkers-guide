<H2>JMS: Three quick question</H2>
13 Sep 1994<PRE>     By the "flip side" of stories I was referring to the other side of
events.  I.e., in episode one, Sinclair is reassigned, but we hear about
this mainly when he's away.  In the comic, we'll see where he is, and
see his reaction to what's going on.  In B-squared, we saw the present
events in the vanishment of B4; in a future episode, we'll actually see
our characters make the decision to go back in time and yank B4 forward,
what went wrong, and so on.
