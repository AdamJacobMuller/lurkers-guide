<H2>Re: Sci-fi lunacy!!</H2>
18 Sep 1994<PRE>     Excuse me, Jason, but please explain to me what the fuck you're
talking about re: "net-worship" after the pilot?  I got broasted, roasted
and toasted here on Internet.  I got raked over every conceivable coal
you can think of, and a couple you can't.  And there's plenty of criticism
to go around.  If you didn't see some of it, that's your problem, that
doesn't mean it wasn't there.  Say what you want, but don't distort the
historical record to make a totally fallacious point.  I think you're
seeing what you want to see, or somehow the discussion is pushing some
button of yours that's got *nothing* to do with me.  If the conversation
has gotten more positive since the series has come on, it's because the
show has gotten better.  These people have no personal history with me,
we didn't go to high school together, nobody here owes anybody money...if
the show stunk, they'd say so.  (And those that think it does, do.)

     I'm sorry, but on this one point you are singularly, 100% deadass
wrong.

                                                                       jms
