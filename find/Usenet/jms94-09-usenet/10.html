<H2>The Writers/Directors List for</H2>
3 Sep 1994<PRE>    Some addendums: Larry, Christy and David Gerrold all also worked for
me on TRGBs.  Mark Moretti is now writing books 2-5 of the B5 comic.  The
first Vornholt novel isn't "El Diablo," a premise that didn't work out,
but "Voices."  Add Jerry Jameson to the list of directors, doing episode
#8 for year two.  (Probably an episode called "The Coming of Shadows.")
 
     On my behalf, have written more than just the one comie; wrote single
issues of Teen Titans Spotlight, TZ comic, and the Star Trek comic.  Also
2 novels and a bunch of other stuff.
 
     Larry's second B5 script is entitled "GROPOS."
 
     Also Kevin Cremin and John Flinn will both direct an episode this
season.
 
     Both David and DC will be starting new scripts soon.
 
     I've just completed my fourth script for the season, "A Race Through
Dark Places," shooting #7.
 
     Lois Tilton is writing B5 novel #2.
