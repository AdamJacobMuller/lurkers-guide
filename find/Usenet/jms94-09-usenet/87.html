20 Sep 1994<PRE>     Joshua...no one has ever said anything about Paramount bugging
devices or anything else.  The Babylon 5 pilot screenplay, bible, series
treatment, and a flock of story premises was given to Paramount
Television in 1989, where it was reviewed and discussed in depth.  Are
we clear on this distinction now?  (Oh, yeah, also the extensive full
color artwork was submitted with it.)

                                                                      jms
