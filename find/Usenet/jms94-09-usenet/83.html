<H2>SQ</H2>
19 Sep 1994<PRE>     The dipping of a telepath into a normal's mind randomly, the kind
of invasion of privacy you see on SQ, is *exactly* why rules were set in
place for B5 telepaths.  Otherwise you've got incredible deus ex machina
problems, and nobody has any right to privacy.  What's the difference
between peeking into someone's mind without permission, which they seem
to have no problem with, and peeking in their door while they're having
sex?  They're both incredible violations of privacy.
