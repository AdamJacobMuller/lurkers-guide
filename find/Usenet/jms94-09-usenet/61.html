<H2>JMS, Artistic control in show</H2>
11 Sep 1994<PRE>    I think that the PRIMARY reason that B5 is as good as it has been is
that we've been pretty much left to our own devices without much in the
way of interference from the studio/network.  The day a studio begins
messing around with a show is when it pretty much becomes doomed.  I don't
see WB so much meddling with Chris' vision of the music as trying to find
the best distributer...it's the *result* of that decision that then affects
the creative product.  Certainly, if it were me, I'd go with Chris.
