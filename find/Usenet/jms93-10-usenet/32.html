<H2>Why Sinclair?</H2>
27 Oct 1993<PRE>     There are many people in the Earth Alliance who are asking the same
question: why Sinclair?  Why a *commander*, below a Captain in rank, to
helm something as important as B5, rather than an Admiral, or someone of
higher position?  Why Sinclair, who was on the fast-track up to the time of
the war, only to suddenly and abruptly fall off the promotions merry go
round?
 
     They are all very good questions...and if I answered them here, I
might as well go ahead and can the whole first season....
