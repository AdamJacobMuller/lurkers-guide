<H2>Substance use in B5 universe?</H2>
19 Oct 1993<PRE>     We will be dealing with the drugs issue, but it's something that I
want to circle for a while and set up properly before dealing with.  I
think certain elements would have changed by 2258, some more permissive,
others more restrictive, and to understand how they function within the
culture, I first think you have to set up how the culture works.  So it's
definitely on our list of things to play with, but understand that like
everything else of note that we're dealing with in this show, we're not
going to do a "drugs are bad for you" story, or a "we should all get
along and play nice" episode, or "we're all equal under the skin" story.
My feeling is that if you haven't figured out that stuff by now, no TV
show is going to teach it to you.  Those topics should be something we
bounce a story off of, rather than making it the entirety of a story, the
way you bank a cue ball off the edge of a pool table to come at your target
from a different angle.  We don't generally come at *anything* dead on
around here.
