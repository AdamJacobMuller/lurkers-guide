<H2>Re: Things that make you go "T</H2>
20 Oct 1993<PRE>     We'd originally planned to go for a more vague sexuality for Delenn;
a male physically and primarily in the voice, on top of the natural
female movements one gets from an actress.  In post-production, however,
we couldn't get the voice to sound as good and male as we'd wanted.  In
addition, a couple of convention showing of a rough cut saw people
responding VERY strongly to her voice as it was, so we finally decided to
let it stand and change the one reference to "he" to "she," and that was
the end of it.
