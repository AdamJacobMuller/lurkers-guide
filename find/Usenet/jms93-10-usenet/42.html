<H2>JMS!  How is Chris' work progr</H2>
31 Oct 1993<PRE>     Chris Franke's work has been wonderful.  (Got the magazine finally,
btw.)  Stylistically, it's all over the place, which is what we wanted;
synth, orchestral, multi-cultural, experimental, you name it, at some
point we've got it.  Because it's a multi-cultural show, with non-human
points of view, we've freed up Chris to do pretty much anything he wants,
and go as far as he wants.  We should have a clearer idea on the main
title theme in the next week or so.
