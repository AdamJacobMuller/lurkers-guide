<H2>Re: Filming Episodes Out of Or</H2>
6 Oct 1993<PRE>     I honestly haven't yet heard the final PR plans for B5.  The studio
was up until just a little bit ago mainly concentrating on promoting the
new fall season.  They've just finished that, and are drawing a breath
before plunging into the January stuff.  I hope to know more soon, though.
