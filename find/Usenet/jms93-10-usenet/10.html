<H2>* New season shot 16x9?</H2>
8 Oct 1993<PRE>     Yes, the series is being shot in letterbox aspect ratio, but until
HDTV is more of a standard, it'll be broadcast using the conventional
ratio.  For those of us who've invested in solid entertainment systems and
good-sized TVs, we forget sometimes that most sets in use out there are
18" or thereabouts, and letterbox just makes the picture too small for
most viewers to handle.  Once HDTV becomes more the standard, then it'll
be broadcast in that aspect ratio.  However, on the theory that those who
buy laserdisks are better set-up for that kind of picture, it's my
understanding that the laserdisks of B5 the series will be in letterbox
format.
 
     Re: Tamlyn Tomita...several things you have to understand.  You can
have 8 really great actors, who all perform wonderfully individually, but
sometimes the result is more than, or less than, the sum of its parts.  In
an ensemble like B5, you have to look at what kind of synergy is generated
by your cast.  We felt strongly that the result didn't really reflect the
individual talents of our cast.  Tamlyn's a terrific performer...and she
wasn't entirely happy with her performance.  It's not the kind of role she
is really used to playing.  Which is not to say that at some point she
might not return to the show in a different capacity....
