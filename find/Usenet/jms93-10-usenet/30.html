<H2>Re: Substance use in B5 univer</H2>
22 Oct 1993<PRE>     Laurel was not standing upside down in relation to the station's
rotation.  The docking bay, at the center of the station, for zero-g, was
above her head, her feet pointed down, toward the rim of the station, in
correct orientation.  Just FYI.
