13 Oct 1993<PRE>     Let me just dive into this whole telepath thing, which you keep
bringing up as something that you feel doesn't belong in an SF series.  I
strongly disagree (obviously, since it's in B5).  The problem with most
uses of telepathy in TV SF is that it hasn't been done very well; it's
either couched in mysticism or used as a deus ex machina.  Telepathy has
had a long and distinguished history as a subject of *quality* SF, right
up to and including Alfred Bester's "The Demolished Man," arguably the
best book ever written on the subject.
 
     What no one has done in TV, and what I want to do, is to ask the
next question, which is what SF is all about.  Because if, in reality, we
discovered tomorrow that there actually were provable telepaths among us,
you can bet your bottom dollar that there would be laws passed about it
the very next day, in every courthouse and congress around.  Questions of
privacy, of criminal prosecution, of lifestyle, of regulation, all these
and more get raised by that particular spectre.  And that is something I
very definitely want to explore in B5...it's not just a throwaway, it's
something that we will discover after a while is *central* to something
that's going on in the B5 universe.
 
     It's no more or less fantastic than jump gates and Vorlons, and there
is room to explore how we as a people would react to something like this.
 And that is what SF is *for* at its best.
