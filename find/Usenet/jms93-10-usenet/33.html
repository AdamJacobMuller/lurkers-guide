<H2>Re: Telepathy in B5</H2>
27 Oct 1993<PRE>     Regarding the Psi Corps news broadcast you noticed...yes, that is a
very small clue to something.  You'll find out what in an episode titled
"Mind War."
 
     I've said before that we're telling stories on two levels; there's a
third as well that slips in.  These are things that you're not SUPPOSED to
really notice or even think about until some point down the road, if you
happen to have watched several more episodes, and you look at the early
ones again, suddenly (as with your noticing of the broadcast) some things
that you swear you never saw suddenly snap into focus, the way you can
look at a picture for a long time, and not see the design until you back
up a bit and, once you can see all of it, the details come clear.
 
     So from time to time, I drop in little things, a phrase, an
unfinished sentence, a news item, stuff that people will assume is just
background or filler...until later.  In a way, it's a little like being
an illusionist.  It makes the writing just that much more challenging,
because at no time can you ever let that get in the way of a person's
enjoyment of one episode totally on its own.  It's just flavoring; those
who've been paying attention will get it; those who haven't, it won't
bother in the least.
 
     It's something Delenn says in "Soul Hunter," something in a headline
in Universe Today in "Sky," bits and pieces that just seem like wallpaper
-- for now.
