<H2>Various Short Subjects</H2>
30 Oct 1993<PRE>     Too much to really delve into -- 57 letters in my box right now -- but
to comment quickly: the techs in the observation dome tend to rotate in
and out, with only a couple repeating.  They're meant to be fairly
anonymous.  At some point we may decide to develop this a bit, but as of
now we have 14 regular and recurring characters, not counting the usual
roster of guest stars, and that's a lot to focus on for now.
 
     The one thing that I dropped fairly completely due to the delay in
getting the series going was the Laurel thread, which has now mutated and
become something even more interesting, actually.  It's something that's
enabled me to now build in a trap door that you won't see for a long time,
even though it's sitting there in plain sight.
