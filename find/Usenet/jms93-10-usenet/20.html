<H2>a question for jms</H2>
15 Oct 1993<PRE>     Interesting that your tagline should be a line from Tennyson's
"Ulysses," which is a poem we often cite in the course of B5; both in the
pilot, and again in "The Parliament of Dreams."
 
     There's a fairly detailed past history of the B5 universe, which we
are even now in the process of refining and putting into real order.  When
we've done this, it'll be more available.  But we're already working on
it, and most of it is already in place (of necessity, since we sometimes
have elements from the past catching up with us, and we need to be fairly
consistent in terms of what happened when, and where.)
