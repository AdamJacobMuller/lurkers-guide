<H2>Question: Continuity between P</H2>
12 Oct 1993<PRE>     Where possible, we're trying to fold production changes into the
shows in terms of dialogue without getting bogged down in it.  At some
point I'd like some character to comment that he wishes they'd stop
changing everything around here...bad as digging up the streets.  My sense
has always been -- and this includes the pilot -- that B5 is still more or
less unfinished, there are sections still uninhabited, incomplete, so
they're still working to get it right.  (They blew all their budget on B4,
so B5 is having to scrape by with less.)  What happened in the pilot is
still canon; that we may or may not choose to use something in future,
such as the privacy mode, does not mean that it didn't exist, or that it
doesn't exist.  Only that we may not need to use it.  IF at some point in
time there was an absolute crying need for a privacy mode, we'd probably
use the block mode rather than the lights, but as of this time, there's
been no such need in any of our scenes for that.
