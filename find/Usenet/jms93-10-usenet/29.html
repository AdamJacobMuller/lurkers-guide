<H2>Detective Work: Joe, can you c</H2>
21 Oct 1993<PRE>     We were going to have a CGI creature in the bar at one point, but
vetoed it at the last minute.  So it's not there.  However, a CGI
character/alien/critter does play a substantive on-camera role in one
episode this season entitled "Grail."
