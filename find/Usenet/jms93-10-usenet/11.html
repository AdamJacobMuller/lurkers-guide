9 Oct 1993<PRE>    Zocalo is a word of, I believe, South American origin for the Grand
Plaza, or central plaza...what in the States we'd call a mall, or a
shopping center.  It's the area in B5 where you have shops, booths, some
food and drinks, that sort of thing.  As I've said before, in the B5
universe, we're *all* going to the stars, and we've worked in stuff from
other cultures along the way to bolster that aspect.  I look forward to
incorporating other elements from South American, Chinese, African and
other cultures as we go.
