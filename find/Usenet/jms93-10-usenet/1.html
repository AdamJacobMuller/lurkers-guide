<H2>Re: Filming Episodes Out of Or</H2>
2 Oct 1993<PRE>     There's one thing to remember in all of these discussions; this is
something that came up very early on, when I was almost exclusively on
GEnie, and has been shown to be true over the year-plus that this dialogue
has been going on.  Granted that there may be some small publicity value
to my participation in all of this; from my perspective, the chief benefit
is the exchange of information, a demonstration of respect for those who
enjoy SF media, and the goal of providing a real behind-the-scenes look at
how a show is done, for whatever help this may be to others thinking of
working in television.
 
     Consequently, this conversation can't be reduced to puff pieces.  If
and when there is a problem, you won't HAVE to hear it on a rumor, you'll
hear it first right here, from me.  This happened before, during and
after the pilot's production and broadcast.  When there have been hassles,
complications or other troubles, I've tried to address them head-on, and
in so doing, illuminate the process a little for those looking on.
