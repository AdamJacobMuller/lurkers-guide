<H2>Re: Scenes _we know_ we'll NEV</H2>
19 Oct 1993<PRE>     We are, from time to time, implementing some pretty scary or unusual
looking aliens.  In "Infection" there's a full-body prosthetic that's
pretty impressive, and the insectoid character, n'grath, appears in many
of our episodes (also a full-body prosthetic with animatronics and radio
controlled stuff).  Personally, even though (or possibly because) he's
fairly humanoid, I have found the 2nd soul hunter in the episode of the
same name to be the creepiest of our aliens to date.  Very believable.
