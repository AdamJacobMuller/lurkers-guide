<H2>Re: Filming Episodes Out of Or</H2>
3 Oct 1993<PRE>     What you say is essentially correct...now that the actors can see
where they're going to be by season's end, it definitely colors their
performance, and adds layers of foreshadowing that aren't even scripted,
but which come out almost subliminally.  It heightens things nicely, and
adds depth to the portrayals.
