<H2>Re: One more "NO" for B5</H2>
14 Oct 1993<PRE>     No, we did *not* do the Evil Twin story in the pilot, unless you so
utterly narrow down your definitions to include comouflage.  The classic
Evil Twin story comes in two forms: 1) The true twin brother/sister who
pops up, is considered nice by everyone, and then turns out to be evil, or
2) The Evil Twin who takes over the life of the Good Twin.  Either way,
you have a very close relationship.  So I simply don't buy your assertion.
