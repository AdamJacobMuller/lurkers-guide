<H2>Better than DSN?</H2>
18 Oct 1993<PRE>     Insofar as I know, the series will be marketed as SF.  And that's
the show we're giving them.
 
     Interestingly, it's come back around to me, through channels, that
some of the changes at those other shows are due at least in part to the
concern about B5.  It's prodding them into doing stories that are more
active, and more character based.  Which the writers have been asking for
for a long time now.  Which is something I've felt from the start, that
this genre *needs* some competition to make it stay fresh, to force each
show to make better stories.
