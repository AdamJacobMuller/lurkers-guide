<H2>"The Gathering" Novel</H2>
17 Oct 1993<PRE>     Thanks.  That a lot of people are looking forward to the series is
one reason I'm trying desperately *not* to over-hype this thing.  What
happens in that case if you're not careful is that everyone starts to
overlay the show with what would be their dream SF series...and there's no
way it can be that to all people, at all times, in all places.  All we can
really focus on is doing the best show we can...and I think that we've got
something very special.
