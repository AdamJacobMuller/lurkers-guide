<H2>Re: ATTN JMS:  B5 Shot Glass?</H2>
29 Sep 1997<PRE>&gt; No, I'm not confused; the confused person here is the one who claims to
&gt;&gt; find alcohol abuse an ugly thing, and appears to have childhood memories
&gt;&gt; of the horrific effect of intrafamilial alcoholism, whether in his own
&gt;&gt; or someone else's...... and yet takes a willing part in the glorification
&gt;&gt; of a product....

Creation secured a license for glassware; I approved the license artwork,
not thinking of anything other than regular glassware (mugs, whatever).  I
was as astonished to see it used on shot glasses as anyone else...and
subsequently made a recent call to Warner Bros. asking that the license for
this particular item not be renewed after they are finished selling the one
already made.  It's my fault, I should've anticipated a shot glass, it's
just not something that I think of, but there's no reason to penalize
Creation by making them warehouse stuff they can't sell.   So they'll sell
what's there on hand, and that will be the end of it.

It's already a dead issue.
