<H2>Re: ATTN: JMS at Defcon 4 in Tulsa</H2>
18 Sep 1997<PRE>The problem is in getting to Tulsa from LA...there is no good way to get
there, they ALL require 2 planes, the latter invariably being a putt-putt
job, and the shortest layover is about 90 minutes, and the show requires
some time spent here that day...so I won't be in on Friday until late, but
the main presentations are Saturday at 1:00 in any event, and on Sunday, so
that's fine.
