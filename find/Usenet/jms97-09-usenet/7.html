<H2>Re: attn JMS: Warner Bros Negotiations</H2>
23 Sep 1997<PRE>&gt;I'm curious as to whether or not you have any part in the negotiations for
&gt;stations/networks that carry B5; like Space:TIS in Canada (the new SF
&gt;network).  
&gt;
&gt;--

No, I've never been involved with that part of it in any way.
