<H2>Re: ATTN: JMS. Not at all important question</H2>
18 Sep 1997<PRE>&gt;  I was wondering what television shows have influenced you with reguards
&gt;to your writing?   What shows did you watch before (or even after) you
&gt;started your writing career that you consider to have a large impact on
&gt;the way you view television?

I'd say that the original Twilight Zone was a big  influence, as was the
Outer Limits, the Prisoner, Blake's 7, and the original Trek.  The writers
most influential were Serling, Chayefsky, Reginald Rose, Matheson,
Bradbury, Ellison.
&gt;
&gt;  And the question that I am always dying to ask creators of my favorite
shows. 

&gt;Did you ever catch the British espionoge show, The Sandbaggers? If
&gt;so what was your opinion of it?  How about the muhc more recent EZ Streets
&gt;and PIcket Fences? 
&gt;
Only saw Picket Fences of those three, which I enjoyed, though it got
kinda wonky in its last season or two.
