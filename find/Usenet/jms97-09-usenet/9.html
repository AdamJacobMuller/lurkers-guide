<H2>Re: ATTN JMS:  Casting of Rebo &amp; Zooty</H2>
23 Sep 1997<PRE>&gt;
&gt;Joe,
&gt;
&gt;I heard a rumor that Rebo and Zooty may make an appearance in season 5.  
&gt;Is this true?  If so, I'd like to make a casting suggestion.  
&gt;
&gt;With a name like Zooty, I picture a short, somewhat squeaky-voiced type 
&gt;of guy.  I believe the perfect choice for this role is none other than 
&gt;Harlan Ellison.  Just imagine him lifting his leg and saying "Zooty - 
&gt;Zoot Zoot".   I bet he'd work real cheap too.  
&gt;
&gt;Rebo would probably be the straight man in the act.  You'd need a big, 
&gt;tall guy with a wry wit.  Someone with a natural chemistry with Harlan's 
&gt;character.  Who could be better qualified than yourself?  Why not, 
&gt;you've done just about everything else on the show .  It'd be great to 
&gt;see you in a cameo.
&gt;
&gt;What do you think?   :)

I suggest Thorazine, and lots of it.
