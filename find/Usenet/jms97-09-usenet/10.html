23 Sep 1997<PRE>Spoilers for The Exercise of Vital Powers

























&gt;
&gt;Okay--in the last scene, when Garibaldi comes into Edgars's living
&gt;room to tell him that he's "in", Edgars is sitting on the sofa
&gt;reading a book. I suddenly realized I MUST know what book he was
&gt;reading.

The Bible.
