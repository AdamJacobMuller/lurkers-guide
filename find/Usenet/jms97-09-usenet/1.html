<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Writing and Music</H2>
16 Sep 1997<PRE>&gt;When I sit down to write, I tend to pick out a CD and set
&gt;it to loop only noticing hours later that I'd heard it 7 or 8 times in a
&gt;row (which drive my wife nuts).  Are you also a victim of the writing
&gt;coma?

What an interesting question....

There's this thing called "state related learning," which means that if
you learn something while, say, in a given room, or under certain specific
conditions, you will be able to remember it better in that same condition
or state.  

When I'm writing, often I'll find or stumble upon a CD that puts me in the
right state of mind to work on it...and when I go in the next day, or a few
hours later, that one will be the one I fire up, to get me going.  So it
may play a lot over the course of a number of days.  It ain't *all* I
listen to, though I do sometimes listen to it sequentially, I can't listen
to just one thing endlessly, but it does get played a lot.

That's the first time I've been asked that question.  It's rare when I
find a new one.  Thanks.
