24 Sep 1997<PRE>Unfortunately, neither we nor WB are in a position to make tapes
available; they will have to come through other sources.  I can only convey
my best wishes and good luck with the class.

You may also want to check in with the folks at the University of York who
are doing an academic conference on B5 in December in case there are any
papers that could be purchased and used.
