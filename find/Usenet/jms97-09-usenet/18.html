<H2>Re: So long... [SiL spoilers]</H2>
29 Sep 1997<PRE>&gt;Up to ItF was good, but I can't stand the aftermath, or what I see as JMS'
&gt;condescending and holier than thou attitude towards fans.
&gt;
&gt;

I was going to respond politely until I got to this part.  Let me put this
to you plainly:

You are an idiot if you take these spoilers at face value, and an equal
idiot if you think from this you know how it's all going to go down.

You don't know what SiL is about, since that hasn't been released in any
form, btw, not even synopses...and for some time now I've been deliberately
leaving some info out of the synopses *specifically* because people like
you, who look ahead and write off the shows forthcoming, piss me off no end.  

All I can say in conclusion is that your analysis of what's coming in the
storylines is SO off-course, SO ill-informed and wrongheaded that it's
hardly worth addressing.  You've not only jumped to conclusions, you've
jumped right off the cliff.  Maybe, rather than being prejudicial, you
might actually want to *see* what's there before making a judgment about
it.  This is no different than the fundamentalists who pass judgment about
a film based on what they read about it, rather than first-hand experience.

Hope that wasn't too condescending....or the little gift I dropped into
"Deconstruction" for folks who read spoilers and then dismiss the show as a
result.
