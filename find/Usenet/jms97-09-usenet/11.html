<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: More "Captain Power" Info</H2>
24 Sep 1997<PRE>The entire story is bogus.  This is just some company or person who has
the rights to the old episodes, and may be trying to whip up enthusiasm.

Whatever the case...we spoke to the folks at Landmark today, which company
owns CP lock, stock and barrel, and they categorically denied that ANYthing
is in the works.  They've been trying to get something off the ground for a
long time, but no, there are NO new episodes in the pipeline.  It's a bogus
story.
