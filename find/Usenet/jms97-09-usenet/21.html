30 Sep 1997<PRE>&gt; Now there don't seem to be any more! I've asked here
&gt;previously, as well as sending messages to babylon5.com, but still
&gt;haven't heard a thing.

Now that the show has moved on to TNT, rather than going througn WB itself, WB
 has kinda moved on in many respects.  TNT will be leading the vanguard from
 now on.
