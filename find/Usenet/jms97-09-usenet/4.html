<H2>Re: Attn JMS: Can B5 get an Emmy? Ever?</H2>
18 Sep 1997<PRE>&gt;Seems to be some old story going around about how B5 isn't eligble for an
&gt;Emmy for some reason. I remember WB had something to do with it, said they
&gt;didn't want it in there for consideration - will that change at all with
&gt;the recent TNT deals, or is B5 just never going to be eligible

No, we're eligible, and have been nominated and have won in other
categories in the past, though all below the line stuff (i.e., not in the
writing/directing/acting categories).  

We had some problem when we (like 90% of other shows) sent tapes of our
episodes to Academy members, many of whom had not been aware of the show. 
Some people in WB PR got upset because we kind of upstaged them, and
insisted we not do so again.  TNT, on the other hand, is going to be very
helpful to us in this in future.

However, since we are syndicated, and SF, the academy (which notoriously
ignores both categories) we will almost certainly continue to be ignored.
