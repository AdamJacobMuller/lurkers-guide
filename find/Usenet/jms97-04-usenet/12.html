7 Apr 1997<PRE>Okay, Okay- I'm the first contestant for the dumbass of the week award!

Of course it is the Omega Class.

Too many hours, too many ships, too many file names.  For those who
care, the files in Lightwave are labelled AgClasDestr, so I fell back on
most recent contact protocol.

Anyway, the rest of the answer does not suffer from the same caffeine
induced hallucination, and is correct.
