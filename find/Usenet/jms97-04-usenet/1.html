<H2>Re: New episodes?</H2>
1 Apr 1997<PRE>Penny-

The new broadcast schedule starts the week of April 21 and runs 9 weeks
straight.  This is quite similar to what we did last year, only the big
block of episodes started the first week in April and ran through May.

I can tell you that there are some mighty cool shows in the batch, and
that the effects crew is really humping to make the satellite date on a
few of them.  (Hey, if it was easy, everybody would do it!:-)
