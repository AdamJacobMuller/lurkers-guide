5 Apr 1997<PRE>Kevin-

Methinks you refer to the Aggie Class, not the Omega, as the O's have no
rotator. 

Anyway-  The Destoyers are all business.  There is no need for extra
storage space onboard, and certainly no need for passengers!  This
allows for a portion of the cylinder describing the same arc as the full
cylider ships.  At one time, we strongly considered locking down the
rotator section during battle to increase manouverability, and  not
using a cylinder or sphere would have made this concept more practical
in presenting a narrower target to the opposition.  As it is, we
postulate that the control systems of the class can take into account
the additional torque generated by the spinning section. 

Besides- we would have to spend a heck of a lot more on filming Zero G
sequences if we locked down, or strap all the actors to their seats. 
Tough to do that acting thing in a 5 point belt for any length of time!
