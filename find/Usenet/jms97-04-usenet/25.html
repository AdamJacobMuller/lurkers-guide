<H2>Re: ATTN GEORGE, JMS: the monkey, the nut, and the jar</H2>
15 Apr 1997<PRE>&gt; Do you enjoy it enough to want to do it again?
&gt; Can B5 episodes be re-rendered well enough for theater sized screens?

Yes and Yes.  The resolution of the renders we are doing now allow for
the highest rez digital video storage currently available in NTSC. For
theatrical release, all we need do is flip this little chromium switch
here.......and out comes a ready to transfer film frame render.


&gt; Not only would it be nice to see B5 on a really big screen "TV",
&gt; if fans flock to theaters to see B5 episodes,  WB's mind-set might allow
&gt; it to issue video tapes.

I'm not really sure if this is a plausible strategy.  Someone at
Warner's would need to book the theatres, and that would be the same
folks who think home video wouldn't fly.

&gt; Does B5 have press kits that it gives to reporters?
&gt; If so, would WB allow tapes of "And Now for a Word" and "The Illusion
&gt; of Truth" to go into the press kits?
&gt; B5 might get more requests for press kits than there are reporters.
&gt; JMS would report this sad situation to WB with the suggestion that he
&gt; start charging most folks (non-reporters) for press kits.

Creative thinking, but......

 
&gt; To sell "The Coming of Shadows" as a promotional item, would JMS have
&gt; to talk to the same monkey (Warner Home Video?) that has its hand around
&gt; the nut in the jar?

Yup.  The home video issue is truly Warner's to deal with.  We can hope
that it will eventually be dealt with, but i sure wouldn't guess when or
in what format.
