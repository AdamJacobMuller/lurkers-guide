10 Apr 1997<PRE>Yes, the PTEN agreement excluded doing our show for first-run on
cable...but it was the only offer anybody made to us.  We took it, because
after five years of trying to find someone who'd trust us to do the show,
you don't walk away from the table once you have what you wanted.  Who
knew if it'd take *another* five years to get that far?  In year 1, it
wasn't the venues, it was the notion that a show like this could be *made
at all* let alone successfully.
