18 Apr 1997<PRE>Not directing yet, still in prep, balancing that with finishing writing
the first two movies.  Just finished the first draft on the second one
this morning (about 4:45 am), then planning to take the weekend to revise
them both.  Then it's back to prep.  Expect me to be offline a lot during
that period, because I'll be going in at 6:25 a.m. and wrapping every day
at 7:00 p.m.
