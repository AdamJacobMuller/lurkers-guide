<H2>Re: Afraid to criticise? Hardly! (was: criticism of B5 in RASTb5)</H2>
5 Apr 1997<PRE>&gt;From the perspective of the staff, I can say that rastb5m gets read with
regularity, while rastb5 gets read from time to time.

The issue is not criticism, which usally has some basis when offered in
either group (okay, I'm being polite- sometimes it's just flamebait). 

The issue is civility.  When the work is treated with respect, whether
it is loved or hated, the poster gets taken seriously.  When the
criticism is thoughtful, we can agree or disagree, but at least we can
talk.  Whether it is through the moderator, or through moderation,
rastb5m is a more homey place to hang out.  

The fact is, there is not one episode that we wouldn't like to have at
least one more tweak on before it really escapes into the cosmos. As a
very good friend of mine says often, Art is never complete it is only
abandoned.  From that perspective, criticism is mutual.

PS- about the last scene bears...... really have to ask Joe.
