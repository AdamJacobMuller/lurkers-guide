<H2>Re: ATTN GEORGE: Docking question</H2>
6 Apr 1997<PRE>Docking Procedures are under the control of C and C as soon as they lock
on to their docking beacon.  Whenever a pilot tries an overide, you get
the potential for an accident, like we saw with G'kar's G'Quan Eth
plantin "By Any Means Necessary".

The station's synchronizers lock into the ship's local computers and
that's all that's needed.
