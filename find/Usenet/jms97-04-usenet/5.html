Yup.  The show was seriously under the gun for delivery when those shots
were done.  If I remember correctly, a couple of these shots came in on
the same day we were to deliver, and there was no time to re-render them
and still make the satellite.

If I were to tell you it would never happen again, I would be a big
liar, or a deluded optomist, but we try.  Animators are human, after
all!  :-)
