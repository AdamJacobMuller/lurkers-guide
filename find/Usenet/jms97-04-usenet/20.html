<H2>Re: ATTN GEORGE: Babylon 5 on DVD?</H2>
12 Apr 1997<PRE>Clay, Jay, Claudia, and other DVD interested folks:

The discussions we have had concerning DVD with Warners have all been
based on 2 episodes per disk, with supplimental material, and full use
of DVD's capability. 

4 episodes per disc hits the compression scheme pretty hard, and I don't
like the way it looks, so we will stick with two per, IF this were to
become a product.

(Big IF by the way, for reasons we have already discussed in this forum)

And, btw, ehat do you mean where are you, George?  I've been here
working my behind off getting these episodes out!  :-)
