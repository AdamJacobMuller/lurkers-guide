<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Is B5 ready for HDTV?</H2>
6 Apr 1997<PRE>There are several schemes in proposal form for both the upconversion on
standard broadcast, to make new sets useful with those who prefer to
continue to broadcast using the equipment they have, and downconversion
for those whop wish to watch a new channel with an old teevee set.  This
will take the form of an inline box that decodes the signal and puts out
a standard NTSC compatible signal.

I am off to the National Assoc of Broadcasters meeting to see what the
latest lies, er I mean proposals concerning HDTV are.  Rest assured that
B5 is ready whatever dopey backwards compatible signal format they come
up with. We do a conformed film neg of every episode for archival that
is just for this purpose.  CG and composites can be rerendered to
whatever new rez that is required, and we welcome the opportunity. 

The biggest problem is that storytellers and hardware folks aren't the
only ones with input into the standard.  The computer folks want in, and
this will make the format even more confused.  Recent gov rules have
allowed the standard to be made more computer friendly.  This means that
MSNBC is just the start!
