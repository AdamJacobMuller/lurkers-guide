<H2>Re: ATTN GEORGE: Severed Dreams-hole in a WALL?</H2>
6 Apr 1997<PRE>Boris-

We don't really know where the Marines actually penetrated, but their
first hole would be through the "floor". If we assume that they know the
station well, it is likely they would punch through an "unimproved", or
storage area first, as it would be easier than to burn through a fully
habitable area. Then they would go through a wall or a door to get at
the goal.  We postulate that they actually were shown entering through
their second burn, and entering the occupied area.

All the 95's are in the same relative position, sequenced from the
center.
