<H2>Re: Episode 422/522 Finale.. Question</H2>
12 Apr 1997<PRE>"What are the chances of major spoilers being leaked from "Sleeping in
Light" over the next year?!?!?!?"

I'm sure some of that's bound to happen...but the reality of it is that if
you add up all the people who are online and might get this information,
you'd actually end up with only about 4% of the viewing audience...so
it'll still have its desired impact.
