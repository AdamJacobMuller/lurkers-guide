You have it substantially correct.  (Even though i have been known to
get it confooosed from time to time- too many hours, not enough pillows)

The Nova Class Dreadnaughts have been around for quite a long time, but
are getting a "sprucing up" for further development. As we discovered in
our own navy, there is a need for several classes of ship of varying
sizes.

 The Omega Class are the next development in that series.  The habitat
section was added, as well as more armored sections.  There is a further
development of that class under discussion.  You can also see some
design elements of the class contained in the Cortez.

The newer ships under development are all of smaller classes, like the
Olympus Class Corvette, the Badger heavy fighter, and the Cotten Class
Deep Penetration Tender.  We will see these participate heavily in the
second of the TNT movies.
