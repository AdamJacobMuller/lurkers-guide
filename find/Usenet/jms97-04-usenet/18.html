<H2>Re: attn jms : autograph queues</H2>
10 Apr 1997<PRE>I think it would take about the same amount of time...and I don't know if
I could take it seriously, it's too much like a receiving line at
Buckingham Palace, and I share nothing in common with Lady Di (well, other
than the wardrobe, but I digress...).

(Then again, Di shaares nothing in common with Buckingham Palace
anymore...)
