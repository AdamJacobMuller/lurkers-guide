<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: B5 PRESS ALERT! I'm dealing with reporter; need advice</H2>
3 Apr 1997<PRE>The only things I'd mention, that are worth passing on to the
reporter...the tendency of B5 to form communities...the use of fairly
rigorous science in the basis of the show, and how we've become NASA's
newest darling...the overall story arc...the ethical issues the show deals
with...all the obvious stuff.

If the reporter tries to create a B5 vs. ST dynamic, that's something to
be cautionary about.  But that's all.

Beyond that, you'll do fine.  Sheridan certainly hasn't had any problems
with reporters, after all....
