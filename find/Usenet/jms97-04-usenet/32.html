Actually, we never change the size of the ships. (Okay, before you start
furiously typing...)   The lenses that we use change often, and
depending on the style of lens selected, the ships may appear closer or
farther away from another object.  This makes things confusing for
sure.  Add to that that the relative distance between two objects may be
compressed to allow for better screen composition, and we may start to
explain what you are realizing.  The hardware of B5 is a bit "undefined"
from a tech point of view.  This will be remedied in upcoming
publications.
