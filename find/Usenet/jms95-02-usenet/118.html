<H2>Some de-briefing!  --AAINT Spo</H2>
19 Feb 1995<PRE>     If you trust Sheridan, there's no need for a lengthy report; plus,
a written report, no matter how well encrypted, can be broken or fall into
the wrong hands.  The best record of a secret meeting that could get you
fired or killed is no record at ALL.
