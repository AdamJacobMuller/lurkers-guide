<H2>ATTN JMS: === Actors reactions</H2>
8 Feb 1995<PRE>     There's always a rush to find out what's in the new script.  In
ageneral, first drafts only go to PTEN and the various department heads
in order to get them on line for the episode requirements.  The final
draft is released to full distribution a few days to a week later.  But
invariably, within hours of releasing the first draft, it's floating
around on stage, going from hand to hand, as people find out what's going
to happen next.  There's always a real sense of enthusiasm and genuine
curiosity.
