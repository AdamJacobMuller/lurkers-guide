<H2>Attn JMS: When do you consider</H2>
4 Feb 1995<PRE>     I don't think I ever can quite view an episode as complete; I always
can think of one thing or another that could've been done.  And sometimes
even the broadcast version isn't the end.  In occasional episodes there
have been small, but noticeable (to me, anyway) CGI glitches which, even
though we've seen the footage a zillion times, we don't see until the day
it airs.  And when possible I ask that the scene be re-rendered, dropped
into the master, and re-satellited.  We've altered the main title about
five times since episode one, just trying to make it look or sound
better.
 
     When eventually we do the transfers to tape and laserdisk, I'll
probably go in there and futz around some more...little things that very
likely nobody will ever notice, but to me they're important.
 
     Someone once said, "No work of art is ever finished, only
abandoned."
