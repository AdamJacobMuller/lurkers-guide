<H2>Thoughts on Sheriden's Dream (</H2>
23 Feb 1995<PRE>     Without commenting much on the rest of this message, there is an
element of what you say in Sheridan's look up to see himself in the
dream.  In a way, there are several Sheridans in that dream, signifying
changes currently in the works, changes yet to come, messages
forthcoming or unrecognized.  It's a very reflective dream, which will
grow clearer the deeper one gets into the show.
 
     Certainly there are some archetypes that always creep into a work
of this sort; for all we all not Jung at heart...?
