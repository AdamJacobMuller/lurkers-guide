<H2>'All Alone in the Dark' used a</H2>
19 Feb 1995<PRE>     Sheridan and the other fighters flew at a slight angle right past
the window in C&amp;C.  I don't see where the problem is in this.  The window
wasn't used as a monitor, it was used as a window.  The starfuries came
out of the cobra bays as the station rotated them planet-side, they banked,
and headed toward the gate, passing C&amp;C.
