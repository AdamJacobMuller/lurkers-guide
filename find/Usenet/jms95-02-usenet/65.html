<H2>(Attention JMS) Ivanova's Mono</H2>
8 Feb 1995<PRE>     To the question "Who thinks up these things," there are only two
answers: me, or the writer whose name appears on the script when it's
not me.  Occasionally me or Larry adding to the other person's script.
That's it, no big committee.  Generally, all you have to do is check
the writing credit.
