<H2>JMS: Products on-screen</H2>
8 Feb 1995<PRE>     Correct; all sponsors advertising on a TV series (different from the
ET situation) would generally like their product shown.  For kicks we
did it with Zima and Kawasaki, and for that, yes, we did have to get their
permission.  The fun wore out, and we haven't done it since.  I'd love to
have someone pay us to show their product; it'd mean we were being held in
esteem in the public eye.  And would help the budget.  We'll see.
