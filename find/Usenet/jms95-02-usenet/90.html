<H2>Quickie L.A/jms/Harlan Alert</H2>
12 Feb 1995<PRE>     Tomorrow, Sunday, 2-4 p.m., Harlan Ellison will be signing his new
comic DREAM CORRIDOR (and maybe other stuff, though I don't know that
for sure) at Golden Apple Bookstore in Los Angeles.  I'm also planning
to tag along and spend more money than I should on this stuff....
