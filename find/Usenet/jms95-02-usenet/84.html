<H2>ATTN JMS: Q on the casting of</H2>
10 Feb 1995<PRE>     Turhan originally came in to audition for Elric in "Geometry;" we
wanted someone with more menace (Ansara), but we were all just blown away
by how wonderful and sweet and nice a person he was, and as he left, I
told John Copeland, "I'm gonna write a part just for him."
 
     So I did, and we cast him, and everyone on the set loved him...to
the point that, at the end of the shoot, they were saying, "You BASTARD,
how could you bring this WONDERFUL man in here and then KILL HIM OFF SO
WE CAN'T HAVE HIM BACK?!"
