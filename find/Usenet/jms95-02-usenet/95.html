<H2>ATTN JMS: Your lucid dream...</H2>
12 Feb 1995<PRE>     Not that much going on, I'm afraid to say.  Upper floor renovations
are about finished, and now they're doing some foundation work.  A couple
of new stores opened downtown.  Spent a couple of dreamtime nights over at
the local college, doing Q&amp;As about writing.  Went past an accident on the
main road the other night, car half-in and half-out of the water.  Folks
seemed okay.
 
     That's about it.
 
     (For those looking on, to explain...I know this is weird...but for as
long as I can remember, most of my dreams have taken place in the same
sort of dream town that's gradually built slowly over the years.  I have
a house there, know where the stores are, the theaters...it has no
correlation to anything real, it's all contemporaneous with the present,
and generally just a flip-side.  Fairly dull, actually.  I think the
reason my brain generated this was that we moved from house to house and
town to town every six months to a year when I was growing up, and this
is/was my brain's attempt to form solidity by *creating* a home town from
bits and pieces of the others.  So at night, I leave *here* and go
_there_.)
 
     Oh!  Wait, we *did* have a bus strike recently, so that's at least
something interesting.  Haven't heard how it turned out, though.
 
                                                                  jms
