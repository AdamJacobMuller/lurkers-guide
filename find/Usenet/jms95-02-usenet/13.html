<H2>Attn JMS: Ultraviolet Clearanc</H2>
4 Feb 1995<PRE>     Ultraviolet Clearance is a term that I think either Larry or I
started using a long time ago on other projects.  Insofar as I recall,
it has nothing to do with Paranoia.  We just got tired of seeing Red
Alert, and figured, okay, what's above red in the spectrum?
