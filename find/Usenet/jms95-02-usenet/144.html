<H2>ATTN JMS: character writing</H2>
24 Feb 1995<PRE>     Without mistake, I do draw upon a lot of my own background and
personality and experiences in relationships and other areas for my
work; it's hard, sometimes, because you've dealt with something in your
heart and nominally closed it...then you not only open it up, and write
it down, you watch other actors doing it.  Certain parts of the Sakai -
Sheridan axis, particularly their first meeting, and throughout that
episode, are almost verbatim.
 
     I don't think that using it in any way invalidates it for future use;
by exploring it once, you learn something about your feelings that you
may not have known before.  With time, and age, and experience, and
reflection, events take on different perspectives.  It's like the
difference in writing about your parents when you're 16 vs. when you're
50.  Same subject, different perspective.
