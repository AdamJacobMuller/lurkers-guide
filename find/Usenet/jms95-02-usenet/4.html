<H2>Attn JMS: Religion in B5 Qusti</H2>
1 Feb 1995<PRE>     "Why did you choose to make religion a part of B5 when all othert
science fiction shows avoid it?"
 
     Well, there's one good answer right there.
 
     Second answer: why not?
 
     Third answer: if one is honest as a writer, then even an atheist
such as myself must acknowledge that it'll be around in 250 years.  It
hasn't vanished in the last 6,000 years after all.
