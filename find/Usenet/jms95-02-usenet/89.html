<H2>JMS: UK opinions</H2>
12 Feb 1995<PRE>     Opinions always matter.  It's sometimes hard to put my brain back
where it was X-months ago, but of course I'd love to hear all the UK
reactions.  And in a way, it might be fun for those who've seen this a
while ago to see others going through the same thing now.
