<H2>JMS: Acts of Sacrifice (OW! TH</H2>
23 Feb 1995<PRE>      The greatest accomplishment a writer can attain is to make his
reader or viewer feel the pain he feels from his characters, and the joy,
and all the other emotions.  If they were painful to watch, they were
painful to write.  So I guess this writing stuff may work out.
 
     (And if you think THIS is an emotional roller coaster, wait a bit.)
