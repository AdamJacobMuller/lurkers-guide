<H2>JMS: TCoS direction (quasi-spo</H2>
4 Feb 1995<PRE>     The emperor falling scene, as with those around it, were shot as
written, down to the slow-motion notation, the close on his head hitting
the floor, the women clutching one another...all in the script.  But it
takes someone as skilled as Janet to take what somebody else might screw
up and elevate it into something truly nifty.
