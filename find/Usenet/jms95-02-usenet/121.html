<H2>ATTN JMS: Your Family</H2>
21 Feb 1995<PRE>     There's fairly little I'd want to say about my family on this forum
(or any).  Not in something that'll be archived.  Suffice to say that it
wasn't terrific; we probably could've been a poster family for
Dysfunctional Post-Nuclear Families.  The question's fine, but this is
something that I'll talk about at cons, or in person, but not on-line.
