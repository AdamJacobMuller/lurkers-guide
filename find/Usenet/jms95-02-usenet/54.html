<H2>JMS: What did you tell Jurasik</H2>
8 Feb 1995<PRE>     I ended up giving Peter info on "Signs" prior to shooting "Chrysalis"
last season; that was the biggie there.  For "CoS" in order for the scene
to match what's going to happen several years down the road in the series,
I had to kinda give him the context of the dream, and what was really
happening in that scene, and what caused it, and how he got to that place
with G'Kar's hands around his throat.
 
     He seemed quite...astonished.
