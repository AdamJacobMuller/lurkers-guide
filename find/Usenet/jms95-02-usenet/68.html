<H2>ATT JMS: B5 Flaws</H2>
8 Feb 1995<PRE>     Re: "fixing" the "guy with the bozo hair," I don't see this as
something that needs to be fixed.  The problem is with some people's
provincialism and rapidity with stereotyping and the like.  It's also
in large measure an American fixation with hair; the show is playing in
MANY european markets, and this tends not to be a problem there.  I find
it interesting that some people can accept red eyes, reptilian features,
pouches, six-set genitalia, jump gates, headbones, shadowships, but fall
apart because of somebody's hair.  Americans are fixated on this stuff;
an entire generation was pegged, stereotyped and ridiculed because of
their hair; you can go down to parts of LA and see hair styles that make
Londo look like a protestant minister by comparison.
 
     There is a notion that one must "fix" something if a few people have
a problem that stems from their perception.  This is what leads to lowest
common denominator programming.  I don't do that.
