<H2>B5 on Cover of April '95 Starl</H2>
18 Feb 1995<PRE>     Yeah, I'd heard about the cover.  I know that the editor there swore
to all and sundry that he would *never* give a cover story to B5, but it
appears the requests from viewers became so much, and their deliberate
omission so obvious, that something had to be done.  (I no longer
cooperate with any interviews for them, though I can't by all rights ask
my cast to do the same.  Whenever I give interviews for other magazines
where the writer also works for Starlog, I specifically request that it
not be used there.)
