<H2>ATTN JMS: Dou you read non-ATT</H2>
18 Feb 1995<PRE>     Because I get so much mail, I scan first for ATT:JMS messages that
are first-timers; when I've gone through those, I then try to make time
for initial replies from others to that starter-thread.  After a thread
has been around for a while, I often phase out in order to deal with the
new ones that need replies.
