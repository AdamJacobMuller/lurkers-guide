<H2>B5 CD</H2>
4 Feb 1995<PRE>     I've now hear the 4th suite in the B5 CD, the new one that will be
added to the general release CD.  Just gorgous.  Christopher asked which
pieces I'd like included, and there's the Garibaldi-cralwing-to-the-tube
music from "Chrysalis," the killing-zone music from "Signs," and some
other just gorgeous stuff.  I think it adds something like 10-12 minutes
to the CD.  I figure it'll probably be set to go out by the end of the
month or shortly thereafter.
