<H2>haunting images....</H2>
18 Feb 1995<PRE>     For what it's worth, I have the same situation...images from the
various episodes stay with me long after they should go.  We've worked
hard to create a sense of, "Here's some extrapolation, one possible
future" and keep it as rigorous as possible.  It *is* a very weird
feeling at times.
