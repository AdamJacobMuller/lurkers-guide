<H2>What do the Shadows want?</H2>
8 Feb 1995<PRE>     This is the main question that hasn't been asked much.  If one takes
as read the notion that B5 doesn't go in for the stereotypical "let's
destroy everything" bad guys, that there's more going on...then what is
the agenda of the shadows?  Okay, you win a war, now you own it all,
what do you do (besides visit Disneyland)?  There has to be more to the
answer of "why" than what appears on first blush.
