<H2>ATTN:JMS...Episode titles</H2>
9 Feb 1995<PRE>     I always have to have a title before I begin writing, since the
title always influences the feel of the show.  I try to design one that
is literary, or refers to a literary influence; it should have a certain
rhythm, and avoid coming at the subject of the episode too dead-on.  For
instance, one could call the recent Psi Cop episode with Bester,
"Capture" or "Chase."  But I wanted it to be evocative, to conjure up
the image of people slipping through the shadows, pursued by others, and
to continue this season's trend toward titles that indicate a coming
night.  Hence, "A Race Through Dark Places."
