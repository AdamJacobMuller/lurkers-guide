<H2>ATTN JMS: TCoS Costuming ?</H2>
6 Feb 1995<PRE>     The broach worn by the Rangers was designed by me and Ann Bruice,
our costumer.  I sketched (dopily and badly) what I had in mind, which
was a stylized human and minbari on either side of a gemstone, both wokred
(worked) into the same metal, and holding the gemstone.
 
     She then took this drawing that looked like it had been drawn by a
drunk five year old and translated it into a striking piece.
