<H2>ATTN JMS: Change of commanders</H2>
14 Feb 1995<PRE>     The story arc proceeds very much as planned; the change of COs allows
us to do all we had in mind originally, plus some more on top of it.
In addition, there are trap doors for every character in case there's ever
a problem.  As in a WW II movie, characters may come and go, but the story
of the war is the story of the war.
