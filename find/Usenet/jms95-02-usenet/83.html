<H2>The Start of The War</H2>
9 Feb 1995<PRE>     "I'd love to know what you have planned next...."
 
     Prolonged torture, revelations, surprises, a whole new spin on the
direction of the show, conspiracies of light and dark, weird sex, the
turning of hunters, accusations, bigger revelations, and the death of
two billion people just to get the ball rolling.

     (and that's just the next 8 episodes)
