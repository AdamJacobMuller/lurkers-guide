<H2>Attn JMS:  Writing "The Coming</H2>
8 Feb 1995<PRE>     Yeah, on several levels, writing "The Coming of Shadows" was hard;
there were times I felt as though I'd just jumped onto the back of a
runaway dynamite truck.  Halfway through that story you can feel the arc
kinda moving underneath you, like some huge, dark fish about to break
surface.
 
     The only way to make a viewer feel a character's pain is if you feel
it in the writing, and a lot of that came through.  I live with these
characters running around in my head 24 hours a day...and when I'd finally
finished "Shadows," it was as if they all sorta stopped and looked at
each other, and at me, and said, "Gee, thank you EVER so fucking much,
jeezus, why don't you just go pluck somebody's eye out while you're at it?"
 
     To which the only reply is, "Now that you mention it...."
