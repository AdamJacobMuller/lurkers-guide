<H2>CoS - Sherridan's bluff  - (sp</H2>
4 Feb 1995<PRE>     Londo would *never* send the shadows against Earth, at least not at
this time.  That would galvanize everybody against the Centauri, while
G'Kar will have a very hard time getting any support since they've pissed
off so many people and burned so many bridges.  And remember, bluffs work
when the other person's more scared of what you might be doing than what
he thinks he can do in response.
