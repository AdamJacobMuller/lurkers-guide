<H2>Re: B5 &amp; E2 in "Sci Fi Univers</H2>
1 Feb 1995<PRE>     Here's a great example of how critics don't have a clue about the
genre or its roots, or what springs from what.  There's a review in
today's Daily Variety (Tuesday) of John Carpenter's new film "In the Mouth
of Madness," which on every level is an H. P. Lovecraft pastiche, from
the structure, the characters, the locales, the names, everything.  So
what does the reviewer call it 3-4 times?  A tribute to Stephen King.
