<H2>ATTN JMS: Acts of Sacrifice SP</H2>
20 Feb 1995<PRE>     As it happens, I made it a point to be on-set the day we shot what we
ended up calling "the Ivanova dance."  Wanted to make sure it was done
correctly.  We only had to shoot it about three times, only in the master,
no coverage.  The crew was absolutely breathless after the first take,
from keeping from laughing.  It was very funny.
