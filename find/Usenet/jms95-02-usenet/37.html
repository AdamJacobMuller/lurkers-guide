<H2>How many comparisons between B</H2>
6 Feb 1995<PRE>     P.S.   Any attempt to make this story track along LoTR is going to
fall pretty fast.  Every so often, people try to attach a template to the
story...it's tracking the history of old Babylon (it is, somewhat), it's
based on the Kennedy/Vietnam parallel, it's LoTR, it's Dune, it's
Foundation, it's Childhood's End...truth is it ain't ANY of them.  And I
wouldn't spend a grand total of 10 years of my life getting, and making
this show just to do LoTR with the serial numbers filed off.
