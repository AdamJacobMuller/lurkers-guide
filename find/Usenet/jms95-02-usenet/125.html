<H2>All Alone in the Night - Anayl</H2>
23 Feb 1995<PRE>      Ejecting would not have purchased Ramirez's life because when the
system came back on line with its analysis, it announced that the
radiation was "already at terminal levels."  From the instant he heard
that, he was a dead man waiting to stop moving.  He could've sent the
ship back, risking a faulty autopilot...and might've died for nothing if
it encountered the *slightest* glitch en route.
