19 Nov 1996<PRE>Re: "magictech"...I believe it was Arthur C. Clarke who pointed out, "Any
sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."

You wanna go argue with Clarke, feel free.

Lemme just make one point here.  In the handful of decades between the
discovery of the atom, and its use at Hiroshima, we learned how to blow up
substantial portions of the planet and render it uninhabitable.  But it
would've taken a lot of them, hundreds, to do the job.  In the 50 years
since then, with the development of thermonuclear weaponry, the job is
even easier.  It's been reckoned that you'd only need about 75 really
decent sized thermonuclear detonations to render the entire continental
United States dead and uninhabitable.

The shadows and the vorlons are *millions* of years ahead of us.  We're
talking differences in technology that are orders of magnitude beyond what
we can hope to comprehend. 

I think a planet killer eminently achievable.
