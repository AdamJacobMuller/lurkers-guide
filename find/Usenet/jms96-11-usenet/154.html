<H2>Audio Advisory (from jms)</H2>
22 Nov 1996<PRE>So earlier this week we did the audio mix on almost all of 404, "Falling
Toward Apotheosis," which airs this coming week.  We did all but 7
minutes, because they were seven...big...minutes.

Last night, after working at the stage from early morning on, John
Copeland, George Johnsen and I left about 7 p.m. to go and mix the audio
for those seven minutes.

We finished at 2:30 a.m.  (And I had to get up at 7:30 a.m. for a meeting,
no less.)

Point being...if you've got a friend with a good TV and a spiffy audio or
surround sound system, you may want to watch this next one over at their
place.  

Just a thought.
