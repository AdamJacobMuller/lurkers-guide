30 Nov 1996<PRE>Yeah, the rankings sometimes drop even when the hard numbers increase when
you're in sweeps period, and everybody's fighting it out and there's a lot
of stunt programming going on.  To stay in the top 25 is a great thing,
and the growth in households is even better.  That's between 10-15 million
core viewers, and that's very good for a syndicated show, especially when
other dramatic shows like the ST series have seen definite drops (as per
the latest Entertainment Weekly).  And our demographics remain the highest
for any syndicated series, so that makes the show extremely attractive to
advertisers.
