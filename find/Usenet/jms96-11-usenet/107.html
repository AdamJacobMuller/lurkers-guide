<H2>Re: Wow! "Whatever Happened to Mr. Garibaldi" &amp; a concern</H2>
12 Nov 1996<PRE>"when we were watching "Hour of the Wolf" G'kar had a line (when answering
Zack) that caused all of us to bust out laughing because of it's relation
to rec.humor.  Was this intentional?"

As I've no idea what this refers to...nope.

And thanks.
