<H2>Re: JMS makes my wife squeal Saturday Nights!</H2>
30 Nov 1996<PRE>"My petite, demure wife, a professional woman of letters, turns the lights
down on Saturday nights (when the show airs), sprawls on the floor,
demands total control, and then when some piece of dailoge strikes her
just so, shreeks, holding in laughter, so she can hear the rest.   Then
when there is a great space scene, load moaning commentary like, "No, no,
no...  YES! Yes, yes!!!" is shouted."

(laying back, lighting a cigarette)

I'm sorry, what were you saying?

Okay, who wants pizza?
