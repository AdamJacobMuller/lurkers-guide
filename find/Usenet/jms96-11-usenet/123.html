<H2>Re: JMS: Archetypes in B5?</H2>
15 Nov 1996<PRE>----&gt;*My question, then, is this:  "Is babylon5 intended to be a modern
myth?  If so, what influences might have lead to the scripting of the B5
saga?  Jung? Campbell perhaps?"*&lt;----

Yes and no.  I'm aware of Campbell's work, and have read much of it...but
bear in mind that his analyses came *after* the creative fact.  If you try
to consciously implement that during the writing, it can start making the
writing feel artificial.  It's the difference between the first two Road
Warrior movies and Thunderdome...in the gap between 2 and 3, he read
Campbell, and started doing things by the numbers rather than following
his gut instinct.  Consequently, 3 feels the least natural.

It's the job of the storyteller to provide myth, or perhaps more properly,
to reinterpret and reinvent myth, since myth tends not so much to be
created as to be newly understood, as we remake the world in our own image
every 15 years.

This is one responsibility that TV has, for the most part, abrogated.  So
I'm trying as best I can to draw some archetypes and myths out of the
collective ether and stitch them together into new patterns for new
audiences....
