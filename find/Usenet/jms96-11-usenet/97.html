<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Why is no one offended at BOTH old races?!?</H2>
8 Nov 1996<PRE>"After watching Z'ha'dum and "Wolf"  (No spoilers here), my main thought
was basically,  who the hell are these old races who assume moral
superiority based on technical superiority?  How dare they interfere with
our development as a species just to suit their own petty needs? I wonder
if any character  on the show will take that same line of thought and
expand upon it?"

Well, until now, that's been primarily unknown to the other species.  Now,
thanks to Sheridan's trip to Z'ha'dum, and stuff coming up, that
information will start to get out.

So yeah, you may find someone or someones picking this thread up....
