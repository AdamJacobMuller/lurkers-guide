<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Biggus Headus</H2>
30 Nov 1996<PRE>"I have been wondering for a while...with the constant inundation of
respect, adoration and awe from most on this newsgroup(not to mention
conventions and fan mail), just how do you keep it all from going to your
head?  I would personally find being dubbed 'Great Maker' a little
intoxicating."

I guess it's easy to not let that happen since, for me, it's all for the
show, not for me personally.  I have a very hard time applying that to
me...the show is the show.  I'm still the same goofball I was before I
made B5.  And I find that whenever I start getting cocky, the universe
whaps me upside the head, and makes me humble *real* fast.

Example...the other day, we were finishing up the editing on 408, "The
Illusion of Truth."  Making the producer's cut is the hardest thing I do,
and I'm just exhausted at the end of it.  So I'm taking a five minute
break, waiting for the elevator to go downstairs and grab a coke, just to
wake up...and I'm alone, walking back and forth in the hall...in that
kinda dopey way you do when you're just utterly whacked...I go a few
paces, swing my leg around, half/stagger back the other direction, go a
few paces, repeat...my mind elsewhere....

And the door opens, mid-swing...and I start for it...and being off-balance
I end up doing this drunken-looking stagger right past the elevator
doors....

The way it would've looked from the inside is as if the elevator doors
opened up on the fourth deck of the Lusitania, tilted and going down, and
some crew member was tumbling down the angled deck....and the door closes
again.

I was too embarrassed to get into it, and waited for the next one.

So it's real easy for me to keep modest...I don't think I have much
choice.

"Do you ever find it affecting your writing?  Your dealing with the cast &amp;
crew?

No, they also have their ways of keeping me modest...hence Andreas' recent
little gag...for which he will pay dearly....
