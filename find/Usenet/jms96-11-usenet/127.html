<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: WHTMG Timeline inconsistencies?  (SPOILERS)</H2>
17 Nov 1996<PRE>No, this is a case where jms screwed up.

Originally, the script read, "It's now 14 days since Captain Sheridan left
for Z'ha'dum and was presumed killed.  Nine days since Mr. Garibaldi
disappeared while on patrol."

I went to edit the first sentence to make it active rather than passive
syntax.  In handwriting on the page (after the first draft, the typists
take revisions and implement them), I meant to write, "It is now 9 days
since Captain Sheridan was presumed killed at Z'ha'dum."  I either missed
changing the days, or the typist didn't put it in (it happens), and that
draft of the script is long gone.  But without knowing which, I'll just
take the rap for it.
