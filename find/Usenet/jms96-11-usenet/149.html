22 Nov 1996<PRE>"And please JMS, don't be hard on Andreas--he's had a hard time the last
few eposides, and with the stress of Peter messing with his nipples, you
could see why he broke and did the gag."

Oh, no...he doesn't get off that easy.  I've got 9 episodes left to write
this season, and that's ample opportunity to make his life a living hell.

"Let's see...he's my employer...he can make me do ANYthing he wants me to
do...I've got an idea, let's fuck with his mind!"

Oh, but I'm going to enjoy this *mightily*.
