13 Nov 1996<PRE>But the thing is, I wasn't *thinking* of LoTR...I was thinking of Orpheus
going into the underworld, of the classical notion of descending into hell
to find oneself or something else...it just bugs me when someone assumes
that they know what was in my head at a time when I wrote something, and
then take that as a given and start making me explain it or acting as if
this is true, when it ain't.
