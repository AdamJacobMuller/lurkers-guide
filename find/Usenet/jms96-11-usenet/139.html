<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Season 5 rumor</H2>
19 Nov 1996<PRE>I've been repeating this time and again...and I'm going to stop now for a
while, because I don't want to keep doing this 5 times a week.

Nothing has been firmly decided by WB yet.  If there were, you would've
heard it.

Every season, we're barely into the new stories, and everyone asks, "Is
this it?  Is it?  Huh?  ANSWER ME?  WHAT ARE YOU HIDING?  WHY WON'T YOU
CONFIRM OR DENY THIS?"

Because I don't know.  Because WB doesn't know.  Nobody will know ANYthing
for sure until probably February.  Which is what I said last year, and the
year before.  

I don't mean to be sharp about this, your message was fine, I'm just
getting a bit worn down by this every year.
