25 Nov 1996<PRE>Actually, I've said pretty much from the very beginning of the first
season, that there was a side-story that could go off, which I'd be
interested in telling.  And that may be a possibility.

And it's not Crusaders (which always makes me think of Crusader Rabbit);
it's The Babylon Project: Crusade.  (That's the working title, anyway.)
