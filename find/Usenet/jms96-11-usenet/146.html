21 Nov 1996<PRE>Actually, to your question, I've taught before, and would enjoy doing so
again in some kind of university environment.  (I taught writing at San
Diego State University for a semester as well, but the other instructors
didn't much like that a working writer was teaching writing instead of an
academic doing it, as they felt it sullied the program and made it too
commercial.)
