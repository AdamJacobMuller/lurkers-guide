<H2>Re: JMS' Purpose for B5 (Philosophical)</H2>
21 Nov 1996<PRE>"JMS leaves us to find our own answers and that looks like, to me, his
message in Babylon 5.  You can't just have someone give you all the
answers.  At some point you have to break away and find your own answers
to your own questions.  This seems to be the idea in a lot of his
scriptwriting and his posts.  In fact, the essence of B5 revolves around
it.  You don't know what other people are thinking, the good guys arent
always what they appear to be, and life is NOT black and white.  Relying
on others for answers makes you a slave to them because you believe
whatever they tell you."


DING!

Give that man a ceegar.
