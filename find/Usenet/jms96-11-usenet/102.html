<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: New Novels Known?</H2>
10 Nov 1996<PRE>The first book is by Jeanne Cavellos, following Anna Sheridan and the
Icarus to Z'ha'dum; the second follows Vir and Londo to Centauri Prime at
the time of the events in these first six episode; and the third follows
Sinclair to Minbar after leaving B5 and setting up the rangers.  This time
out, I decided to assign out the stories, to make sure they were accurate
and in continuity.  The first one up may be the best to date, I'm 2/3rds
through it and haven't made a note yet.
