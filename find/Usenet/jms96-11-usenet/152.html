<H2>Re: Attn JMS: A Thank You</H2>
22 Nov 1996<PRE>Thank you, your words are most kind.

I guess you have to understand...I come at this from the perspective of
having been an SF fan myself, I've *stood* in those lines.  And been cut
off.  I swore, up one side and down the other, that if I should ever get
my chance to do something of merit, if I ever got known (outside of
America's Most Wanted), that I wouldn't allow ANYone to experience that
feeling.  I've signed for sometimes 3, 4 hours at a time.  Doesn't matter.
 Nobody leaves emptyhanded.  Nobody.

This has infected many members of our cast, who feel as I do...and they go
far, far, FAR beyond the call of duty.

'Cause, basically...it's the right thing to do.
