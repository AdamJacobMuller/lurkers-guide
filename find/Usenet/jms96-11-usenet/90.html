6 Nov 1996<PRE>The date stated obviously refers to the US, not to the UK.  The US
experiments in TV fell a bit by the wayside when the war hit.  Some
European communities kept at it.  But question: are you sure, when the BBC
refers to its founding in 1936, that they're not referring to BBC *radio*?
