27 Nov 1996<PRE>No, it wouldn't have been as bad if they'd been prepared for us.

Also, while many boast about IRCs being the end-all of these things, the
IRC that I did while in Tampa had just as many servers blow up, all over
the place.

Final figure was that 6,000 tried to get into this thing...there ain't a
server on the planet that can handle that.
