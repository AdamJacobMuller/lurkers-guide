<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Why the Theme Change?</H2>
9 Nov 1996<PRE>We change the theme every season to reflect the tonaity and direction of
that season's story.  Every season when it butts up against the previous
season's intent, a lot of folks ask why change it, it was better
before...and then, by the end of the season, when people see how it fits
in, generally they like it a lot...and then ask why it got changed for the
*next* season....
