5 Nov 1996<PRE>"As much as you hate to admit it, you're an important person, not just out
there, but in the lives -- right there, in our faces, guiding us for a
small, or large part of the day -- in the lives of millions of people.  We
care about you enough to cause chaos.  But it's not any one person's
fualt."

I'm not important.  The story, yes, maybe...but not me.

James was the one who initially posted it, having been exposed to the one
person in IRC who wanted to do this.  If B5 is about choices, consequences
and responsibility, we have to own up to making a choice to go public with
something rather than check it out, recognize that there are consequences
to other people when you do this, and then accept the responsibility for
those consequences.

"Quite frankly, when it comes to B5, I find that the people are a lot more
polite and honest than other 'netters, and I have come to trust people."

This part I agree with.  I can't tell you how often I've had convention
organizers, from Worldcon and elsewhere, tell me how pleasantly surprised
and pleased they were that the B5 fans were invariably well-spoken,
polite, intelligent, and friendly.  We've got a good rep, and I guess I
want to protect that.
