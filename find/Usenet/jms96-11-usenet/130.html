<H2>Re: Universe Today #2 ???</H2>
19 Nov 1996<PRE>I have the new edition on my desk, in final form, and it's going out now. 
The problem is that normally, when licensed stuff comes through for
approval, I get it in and out the door in 48 hours.  But since this is our
own license, I can't approve our own stuff, and it has to go through WB. 
WB sat on this thing for about two months.  We're trying to work it out
with them to get things approved more quickly.  It's kinda ridiculous.
