<H2>Re: Attn JMS: You Did It (WHt Mr. Garibaldi? *SPOILERS*)</H2>
12 Nov 1996<PRE>Thanks.  The script was easy to write story-wise, I think it only took me
a few days (in general, the faster the write, the better the script, when
it comes to something like this...writing in white heat is best), but
*very* difficult from an emotional standpoint.  I was just about as wasted
after writing it as you were after seeing it.  There's a lot of stuff in
there that's difficult or painful to touch, and you can only hope that it
comes out okay.  I'm happy it did.
