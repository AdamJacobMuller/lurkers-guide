<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Questions About Scriptwriting Book</H2>
8 Nov 1996<PRE>I debated long and hard about including a section about comics in the
script book, and finally opted against it, on several grounds.  1) I
wanted to specialize in performance-style scriptwriting, involving living
people, and 2) while I've written some comics, I don't feel enough of an
expert yet to set down my poor understanding in book form.
