<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Arc ending this season?</H2>
26 Nov 1996<PRE>"I then pick up a copy of TV Zone(UK Magazine for sci-fi etc) and read in
it an interview with Bruce Boxleitner which clearly states the shows 5
year arc is ending this year.  And then I pick up a copy of Cult TV, with
an interview with JMS in it, and this also features the same info, except
this time it states quite clearly that Warner Brothers have asked JMS to
resolve the shows 5 year arc this season."

Yes, I have those two magazines as well, both from the same publisher. 
And I was rather upset when I saw them, because, if you will go back and
read them again, you will see that nowhere are Bruce or I quoted as SAYING
that there is only going to be 4 years.  The *magazine* says that, the
writer says that, but they nowhere provide a quote from anyone backing
that up.  I *sure* as hell didn't say that, and Bruce has indicated the
same thing to me.

The magazine is making assumptions.  Let me state this again: nothing has
yet been decided for certain.  If it had been, I would tell you.

Look...let's be logical about this, shall we?  If I knew this would be the
last year, what possible mileage is there in keeping this secret?  I'd
want to put this info out there in hopes of either a) getting a campaign
going, or b) bracing the fans for the inevitable, if it were inevitable
(the joke about your mom's on the roof and we can't get her down).  

Let me repeat this: I DON'T KNOW.  WB DOESN'T KNOW.  Nothing has yet been
decided for certain.
