19 Nov 1996<PRE>"Was this scene redone for WHtMG?  I'd have to compare, but I think I
would've noticed that hopeful smile at the end of Z.  It would've been
just a -little- out of place, under the circumstances."

It's *exactly* the same footage, frame for frame.  Only your perspective
has changed.  

Sort of like Shroedinger's TV show.
