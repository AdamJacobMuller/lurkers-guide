<H2>Re: Paradigm shifts and B5/Trek</H2>
29 Nov 1996<PRE>"No one's claiming Trek doesn't have its failings.  The issue at hand is
the B5 folk who feel compelled to constantly ridicule Trek.  There's not
much point, and the attitude is suspiciously cult-like, even if they
aren't really a cult."

One fallacy in your thinking: while there are many ST fans who haven't
seen B5, there are insofar as I know *no* B5 fans who haven't seen ST, and
in most cases, began as ST fans.  These are the same complaints many of
them have had with ST for a time long before B5 ever came on the
map...only now in some cases they have a show which is doing what they
have been saying should be done for some time now.  

This is not a B5 problem...it's an internal ST problem.
