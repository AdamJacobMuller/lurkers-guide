<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Censorship and "Wolf" (no spoilers)</H2>
3 Nov 1996<PRE>"In "The Hour of the Wolf" there are two scenes -- you know which ones --
that seemed quite a departure from what one usually sees on TV.  Did you
write "Wolf" before or after your revelation that you were not bound by
Standards and Practices.  'Cause if you wrote this *before*, then we're in
for quite a ride."

Aside from the desk scene, which was the other you're referring to?

Oh...and the answer is...before.

Hang on.  It's going to be a bumpy night.
