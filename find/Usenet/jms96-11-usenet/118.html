15 Nov 1996<PRE>I briefly considered giving G'Kar a second, after the revolving door
Na'Toths, but as I looked at it...as you say, the others all DO have one
like that, and I figured it might be good to have someone *without*
that...especially after the fall of Narn, when the staff would be
canceled.  And there's something I like about G'Kar being alone in all
this.  Anyway, it varies the mix a bit.
