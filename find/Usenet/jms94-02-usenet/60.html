10 Feb 1994<PRE>     "Tell you what, as soon as JMS publishes a note to the effect that
he's going to have a realistic hetero character, I'll send him a nice
note of appreciatoin and support, and see if I can get all the hetero
newspapers to carry articles about why we should give B5 a chance,
because it will have unfashionable hetero types in it."
 
     I'm going to have a realistic hetero character in B5.  Several, in
fact.
 
     Your serve.
