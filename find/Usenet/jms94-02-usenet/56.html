<H2>soul hunter, ferengis &amp; fired</H2>
10 Feb 1994<PRE>     First, I'm not "star trekkin" anyone re: the translation on the soul
hunter (not needing a machine).  He *has* been to earth.  Whether or not
I have the opportunity down the road to get into this, that happens to
be the truth within the B5 "backstory" that's been created.  In other
episodes, when a translation machine is required, it's used.  (In
addition to Kosh's and n'grath's translation devices, we use them in
other shows, as in "Legacies" with a race called the Pak'ma'ra.)  In this
one instance, he knew the words.  I don't consider that "star trekkin'
anybody.
 
     Re: your statement that the headwear of the S.H. is "stolen" from
the Ferengi...may I be so bold as to respond to your rather loud note with
some volume of my own?  To wit: watch something other than Star Trek, and
maybe spend a little time learning stuff about your own world.  The
headware is based upon the kind used in various african and aboriginal
tribes.  Trek didn't invent it; we have photos of its use through
history, as well as sketches going back further.  As it happens, the
costume designer has never seen "DS9," doesn't watch TNG, has no idea
what a Ferengi is.  Neither do I intend to not do something, based in
real history, just because some other show has done drawn on that same
background.
 
     You clearly think that if something appeared in ST, then ST must have
 
invented it, and that if it appears anywhere else, it must've been
influence by ST.  Wrong on both counts.  I would suggest that you have
been watching too much ST, and not nearly enough of the Discovery
Channel.
