<H2>Babylon 5 Writers Guide Re: Mi</H2>
2 Feb 1994<PRE>     Your pyramid of something happens, it's critical, confrontation,
resolution, is not something *bad* in shows...it happens to be universal
dramatic structure.  Introduction of the problem, rising action, climax,
and denouement.  If you don't think this is appropriate, then you are
dismissing literally 95% of all literature, all movies, ever created in
the history of mankind.  So B5 meets the standards applied to literature.
I don't see a problem here.
 
     The rest of your note is little more than specious and petty.  And I
would defy you to find *any* way to categorize "The Parliament of Dreams"
by this breakdown.  Is there anything that you would *not* just go ahead
and classify as a soap opera device?  From your list, anything you decide
is soap opera goes on the list.
 
     Specious and petty.
