<H2>Born to the Purple  (Minor Spo</H2>
18 Feb 1994<PRE>     Fabiana didn't shave her head to play Adira; that's a prosthetic
head piece.  Ditto with all our Centauriy women.  (Funnily enough, the one
time we DID have a bald woman as a background extra, those not in the
know on stage kept commenting on how fake the bald-cap looked....)
 
     The planet behind B5 ain't the moon.  This is a LOT further out.
