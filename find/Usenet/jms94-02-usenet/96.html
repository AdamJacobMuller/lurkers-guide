<H2>JMS Question: Earth Alliance</H2>
16 Feb 1994<PRE>     The EA is fairly large, but not on a par with the Centauri at this
point.  There are various space platforms/colonies, colonies on the Moon,
Mars, a major transfer point off Io...they've gone in and "helped" a
number of bronze-tech worlds (that happened to have certain resources
useful to EA), and are generally spreading like mice in a cheese factory.
