<H2>Re: Opening Narration</H2>
1 Feb 1994<PRE>     The rotating narrator thing was something that I mentioned en
passant at the LosCon screening of "Midnight."  What I noted was that I
was considering rotating the narrators each season; Londo for the pilot;
Sinclair for year one; Ivanova for year two; Garibaldi for year three;
G'Kar for year four; and Delenn for year five.  Haven't decided yet if
I'm going to do it or not....
