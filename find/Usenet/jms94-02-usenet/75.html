<H2>Re: Concerns about Scientific</H2>
12 Feb 1994<PRE>     Re: the question of consistency/inconsistency in the B5 universe:
where you get inconsistency is generally when you have more than one
voice in the show, creation by committee or different administrations.
 B5 is my show, and it's as consistent as I am...which means sometimes
you'll catch something small, a glitch between scripts written far apart
(calling the main console Station One instead of the Primary Console),
but on the big issues...I doubt very much it'll happen.  I've thought out
this universe pretty thoroughly over the last 7 years.
