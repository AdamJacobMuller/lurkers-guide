<H2>JMS? Actors &amp; Arcs</H2>
13 Feb 1994<PRE>     Some of the cast know the full extent of their character's story,
some know a little, some know very little.  In those cases where we need
to set stuff up for down the line, we have to explain some of these
things.  Some of the cast want to know their future, some don't.
