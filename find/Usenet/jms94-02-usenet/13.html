<H2>Series premier thoughts (some</H2>
1 Feb 1994<PRE>     Just a quick note re: the idea of sending B5 ships out to safeguard
all incoming ships...can't really be done.  There are only a very small
number of fighters (comparatively speaking) on B5, and a *LOT* of ships
coming in on a daily basis.  Once they're through the last gate, to B5,
they're safe.  But there are gates in between, where they're vulnerable.
 You'd have to safeguard the whole galaxy, practically.  Can't be done.
