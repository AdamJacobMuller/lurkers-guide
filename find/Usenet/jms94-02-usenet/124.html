<H2>"Infections" vs.  Guyver (spoi</H2>
21 Feb 1994<PRE>     I've never been a big fan of japanese animation, and have never heard
of Guyver before it came up in this discussion.  (I actually thought that
the Guyver references were some kind of reference to McGuyver for a long
time, until finally I began to suss out that we were talking animation
here.)
