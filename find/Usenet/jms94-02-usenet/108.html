<H2>JMS Question: Where Were They?</H2>
17 Feb 1994<PRE>     The Centauri Republic tended to go after species where they could get
some advantage; they'd find a world on the fringe of being able to hit
space, with a technological base, move in and take over.  It's sharper
and easier than taking over a world without tech; not much to offer.  By
the time we got to that point, they had begun the decline of their
empire, and basically greeted us with a shrug.  And there is no EA rule
about non-interference.  The only real rule applies to surveying distant
worlds for mineral resources, and a restriction against strip-mining
worlds that contain sentient life.
