<H2>B5 and Cronos</H2>
21 Feb 1994<PRE>     The only Cronos movie that I know of is "Kronos," a mexican-filmed
black and white film in which an alien device crash-lands and grows to
skyscraper size and begins stomping its way across Mexico...looked like
a cross between a rubik's cube and a peppermill.
