<H2>Re: About the RFD Process</H2>
2 Feb 1994<PRE>     Since you raised the question about the explosion of messages...I
have a small suggestion.  Right now, when I log onto GEnie and get the
alt messages in my email via the Internet gateway, there are now about
200+ messages a day.  I do read them all, but it's going to get a lot
busier.
 
     If there is a message out there by someone that requires a response,
or is a specific question for me, if you could begin the note with JMS,
in the subject header, I'll know to read that one first.  Others may have
to sit in the box for a day or so until I can do a massive read.
 
                                                                jms
