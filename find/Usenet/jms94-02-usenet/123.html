<H2>JMS: Generic EZ Q's</H2>
21 Feb 1994<PRE>     The Earth/Minbari war started with a Minbari first encounter (by us)
that went tragically wrong and resulted in a firefight, in which the
leader of the Grey Council was killed.
 
     Kosh's ship is still on B5, except when he takes it out.
 
     Virtually all of the B5 story takes place within one galaxy.
 
     Yes, Earth religions have had to come to grips with the existence of
alien cultures; and religions from both sides have filtered into human an
alien life.  We won't be dealing with that this season because we deal
with the topic of religion a lot this season, and don't want to get too
bogged down with it.
 
     Franklin's associate wasn't a Foundationist, no.
