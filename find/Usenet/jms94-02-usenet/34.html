<H2>Midnight Complaints?</H2>
3 Feb 1994<PRE>     To have a station commander *and* a rep for Earth can be cumbersome
in many ways, when someone has to give orders.  It's cleaner this way;
and no different than any of the sailing vessels of the 18th century and
before, when each captain was viewed as, and expected to perform as, the
official representative of his country.
 
     There is, however, a second agenda at work here, which you'll find
out about a bit in "Raiding Party."
 
     Re: Sinclair taking risks...watch "Infection" and its tag.  As for
jumping in a fighter every show...no, that we don't do.  Of the 17 or
so episodes we've shot to date, Sinclair only goes out in a fighter in
maybe 3 episodes.  Ivanova, Garibaldi, or other fighter pilots go out
elsewhere.
