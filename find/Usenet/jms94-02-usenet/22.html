<H2>Question re Earth Alliance</H2>
3 Feb 1994<PRE>     You are correct in that the Earth Alliance consists in the main of
humans.  Aliens are generally not integrated into the system, except in
very low-level stuff.  (In some bronze-tech worlds where humans have come
in and pulled an India/England relationship, you may have colonial
governors who are native aliens, but are basically puppets.)  There's
more than just Mars, Earth and the Sol colonies; there are a number of
other worlds and systems out there into which Earth has made a dent.
