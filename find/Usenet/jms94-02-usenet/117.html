<H2>Re: Ban on creative works? Huh</H2>
18 Feb 1994<PRE>     Obviously, I can't say anything officially here saying "Go write
fanfic to your heart's content."  Because PTEN would (correctly) stick my
head on a pike in the middle of downtown Hollywood.  However, let me be
ABSOLUTELY clear in this: I have NEVER said, "Don't write it."  All that
I have EVER said is, "Don't put it in a place where I can see it or
stumble over it."
 
     Email is a private system; so is a closed mailing list.  I'm not
here to be PTEN's eyes and ears; I really don't care what happens out
there in that respect.  My only real concern is that whatever it is that's
happening, *I don't see it.*  It's better for all concerned if I don't
see it, or don't have access to it.
 
     So on a personal level, I have no real problem with what you propose.
