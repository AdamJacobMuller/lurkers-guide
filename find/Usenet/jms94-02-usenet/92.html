<H2>Soul Hunter and General</H2>
15 Feb 1994<PRE>     Sinclair gets into some real strong arguments in many episodes; he
is almost *constantly* at odds with Dr. Franklin in "Believers" (and just
about loses it at one point), he's arguing and exhausted nearly the entire
episode for "By Any Means" (and *does* lose it at one point, in a way
that says get-the-hell-out, and is also weirdly funny).  Anyway, it's
definitely there.
