<H2>Something I'd like to see (was</H2>
25 Feb 1994<PRE>     You've already seen a non-O2 alien wearing a breather in an O2
section; one of the two victims walking down a hall in "Infection" just
before they get smeared.  Also an alien or two in the gallery in
"Midnight," though I don't know how clearly they can be seen.  We do it
from time to time....
