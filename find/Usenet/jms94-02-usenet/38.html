<H2>Starfury launch sequence and m</H2>
3 Feb 1994<PRE>     Incorrect.  The Starfuries are launched from the rotating part of
the station.  They're launched from the cobra bays, which are the cobra
shaped projections alongside the round front of the station, and attached
to it.  They definitely rotate.
