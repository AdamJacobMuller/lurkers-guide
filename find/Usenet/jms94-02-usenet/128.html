16 Feb 1994<PRE>     Re: the shape of the doors...they're set to notch into the wall,
and in the case of depressurization, bolts shoot through the "teeth" that
insert into the wall, to lock it securely into place.  It's much more
airtight that way than a conventional door that swings or opens in the
middle in case of an accident that opens a portion of the station to
vacuum.
