16 Feb 1994<PRE>     Sinclair functions within the parameters of Earthforce Command, but
much in the way as a provisional governor might function.  He is answerable
both to his superior officers in Earthforce, *as well as* the Babylon 5
Senate Oversight and Appropriations Committee.  A senatorial liaison often
works between Sinclair and Earthdome (the EA capital city).
