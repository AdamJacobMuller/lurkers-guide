22 Feb 1994<PRE>     "I object to the PSI stuff because the show was said to be SF."
 
     Yes, and telepathy has been dealt with considerably throughout the
long history of SF.  One of the finest novels in the genre is Alfred
Bester's "The Demolished Man."  Telepathy has also been used as a valid
plot device in SF by Ray Bradbury, Larry Niven, Kurt Vonnegut, Brian
Aldiss, John Brunner, Kate Wilhelm, Robert Sheckley, Eric Frank Russell,
Walter M. Miller, Anne McCaffrey, Richard Matheson, Fritz Leiber and
Samuel Delaney, to name but a FEW.
 
     If you want to argue that telepathy isn't a valid area for SF, or
doesn't qualify as SF, then your argument is with them, not with me.
 
     And you'd lose.
 
     (With luck, this will close this discussion once and for all.)
