<H2>Harlan Ellison and Babylon 5</H2>
13 Feb 1994<PRE>     Harlan is our conceptual consultant.  His job is to sit perched on
my shoulder like Jiminy Cricket and point out to me the chuckholes,
detours, and disasters-in-the-making that I might otherwise stumble into
as I galumph my way through this show...and to harangue me and keep me
on the SF straight and narrow and to challenge me constantly to do better.
 
     He also reviews stories, helped write the opening narration, has
given us several good concepts on the running of the B5 station, and
otherwise...well...consults conceptually.
