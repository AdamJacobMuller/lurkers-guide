<H2>Re: USA Today Review--Londo is</H2>
10 Feb 1994<PRE>     The hairpiece used for Londo is woven backwards, so it'll hang
upward, for lack of a better term.  Held in place with spray.  The
costume is notable for its detail work...lots of medals, intricate
symbols (scarab/beetle type jewels on the shoulder and collar), with many
layers.  Beyond that,it's kinda hard to describe.
