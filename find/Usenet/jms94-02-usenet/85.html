13 Feb 1994<PRE>     Negative.  If you'll look to the right of your ascii drawing,
you'll see a square (round in the series) section.  Several cobra-shaped
arms surround that section.  That's where the fighters are launched.
 
     You'll get a better view of this area as we go along, particularly in
an episode called "Survivors."
