<H2>Re: Concerns about Scientific</H2>
21 Feb 1994<PRE>     Just a minor correction: I was never involved with the production or
writing of the original V series or miniseries; I was hired by Warners to
write a new (and as yet unproduced) 4-hour miniseries to revive the V
series in syndication.  The project was shelved when it was realized that
it would be too expensive to try it for the syndicated market.
