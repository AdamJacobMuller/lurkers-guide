<H2>Music change from Gathering to</H2>
8 Feb 1994<PRE>     Copeland decided he wanted to tour, and do another album.  That
kinda took care of doing this season.  And in the long run, it's worked
out well, because Christopher Franke has in many ways, I think, far
exceeded what Stewart did for us, good as that was.  There's some killer
stuff coming, very aggressive, very moving and powerful.  His piece for
"And the Sky Full of Stars," -Requiem for the Line-, is brilliant, sad,
emotional, brave...just nifty.
