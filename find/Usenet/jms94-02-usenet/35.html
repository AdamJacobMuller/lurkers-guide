3 Feb 1994<PRE>     The item on the back of Sinclair's hand is a Link, which is their
personal communications system/powerbook/mainframe access system/pager.
 
     The blue and green painting on the Starfury is probably the Sea
Witch, a personal design.  The stylized EA seen on the wings, and on the
EA command staff, is the Earth Alliance symbol.  (The EA silhouette is
then altered within the lines to accommodate different divisions, command
with a crosshatching, security with a gun sight, and so on.)
 
     No comment.
 
     Some alien fonts, yes.
