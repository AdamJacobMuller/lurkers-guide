17 Feb 1994<PRE>     Re: your concern about putting "bab" in front of everything (the
message to which you responded mentioned babcommand, babalert, babguard
and so on)...it's not, and we don't.  There is only one thing with that
previx, BabCom.  That's all.  There ain't no more.  The person who
thought he heard bab-alert misheard MedAlert.
 
     The concern as raised has *nothing* to do with our show.
