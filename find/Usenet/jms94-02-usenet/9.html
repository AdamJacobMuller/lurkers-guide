<H2>PRESSURE SUITS:  COOL!!</H2>
1 Feb 1994<PRE>     Actually, as you'll see in "Sky," sometimes the Good Guys *do* get
their ships hit; sometimes they blow up and kill the person (as you will
see), and sometimes they do damage without destroying the ship, in which
case there is an eject mechanism that separates the cockpit part from
the rest of the fighter, which contains the volatile reactors.
 
      So in those circumstances, a flight suit is a *very* good idea....
