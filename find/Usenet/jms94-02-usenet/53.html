<H2>Re: Thoughts on why some "just</H2>
8 Feb 1994<PRE>     Your theory that the two different internal-mind views are
inconsistent is, of course, *entirely* contingent upon the assumption
that all minds work -- human and alien alike -- work the same way, see
themselves in the same way, perceive the world around them and their part
in that world in exactly the same way.
 
     And, of course, if all minds thought exactly the same...we wouldn't
be having this disagreement about inconsistency, yes?
