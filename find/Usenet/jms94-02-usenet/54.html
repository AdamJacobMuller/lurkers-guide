<H2>teeny problem with soul hunter</H2>
10 Feb 1994<PRE>     There *is* a beep there; it's just soft.  We learned after making
that episode that some stations crunch down the sound a bit, dropping the
highs.  We later bumped up the lows to make it more apparent.  It can be
heard in most stations, unless they crunch the sound.
