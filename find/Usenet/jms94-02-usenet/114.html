18 Feb 1994<PRE>     Correct: when we've told our five year story, the B5 series comes to
an end in terms of original episodes, and then will, like all other TV
series, go into long-term reruns.  There's one possible spin-off that
has always been feasible, but it would not be a B5 series, rather following
one thread in a different direction.  But that also has a definite end,
after which there *can't* be any more followups, for reasons I can't now
go into.
