<H2>MOTFL: Mars Colony &amp; G'Kar's f</H2>
6 Feb 1994<PRE>     Just as an advisory, I'd ask you to be more careful in your
language, "...makes me wonder if JMS has lifted some ideas and milieu
from Kim Stanley Robinson's 'Red Mars.'"
 
     I do not "lift" ideas.  My ideas are my own.  The B5 storyline goes
back 7 years.  There seems to be some conception in the public eye that
TeeVee folks just sorta go out there, look at books, and start lifting
things.  This is not only inaccurate, but I find it personally offensive.
 
     Partly because I *know* Kim Stanley Robinson, albeit slightly.
 
     I know you meant no harm, so don't take this as a flame.  I just felt
that it required a response.
