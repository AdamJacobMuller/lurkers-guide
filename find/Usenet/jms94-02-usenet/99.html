<H2>B5 Versus Tekwar in LA</H2>
16 Feb 1994<PRE>     Forget B5 vs. Tekwar in the ratings...I just realized that one of our
best episodes in this first batch, "The Parliament of Dreams," is going
to go right up against the Tonya Harding/Nancy Kerrigan skating part of
the Olympics.
 
     We're doomed.
