<H2>"Collision course" in SH (spoi</H2>
23 Feb 1994<PRE>     Re: why soul hunter #1's ship was out of control...the second soul
hunter comments that they've been tracking him, and caught up with him a
few days ago.  They attacked, "and he escaped, his ship damaged."  That
is what brought him here...and led his pursuers to this place as well.
