3 Feb 1994<PRE>     Re: Londo as a romantic character...bless your heart.  You are the
first to have nailed it absolutely on the head.  If I had to write a
description of the character, I doubt I could have done any better than
what you just wrote.  There are a *lot* of episodes that bring this out
in him, including the next one up, "Born to the Purple," which I suspect
will end virtually all of the hair jokes once and for all.
 
     Anyway...yes, and thank you, that's it *precisely*.
