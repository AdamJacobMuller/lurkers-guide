<H2>prejudice in B5(was:Re: BABYLO</H2>
7 Feb 1994<PRE>     You may perceive "alien" as a negative word.  It is also a correct
word.  Now, one could refer to them as "atmospherically challenged," or
"genetically other-abled," or "adhering to DNAlternatives," but among
humans, talking to one another...they're aliens.  And to them, WE'RE
aliens.  No, it ain't polite.  Who said it had to be?
