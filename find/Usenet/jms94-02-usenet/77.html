<H2>Questions re Centauris in "Pur</H2>
13 Feb 1994<PRE>     The correct term is the Centauri Republic.  It can be called an
empire, but that's the name.  Trakis, Adira's owner, was not a Centauri,
but (and this is something we may bring up at some point down the road),
was at one point a Centauri slave.
