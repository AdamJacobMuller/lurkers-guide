<H2>Re: Mojo answers FX question</H2>
11 Feb 1994<PRE>     Mojo is incorrect.  The regular footage of live-action stuff on B5
is shot widescreen, with the regular aspect ratio emphasized generally
for initial broadcast in that format.  We picked footage from various
scenes already shot for use in the main title sequence; compare Delenn
and Sinclair walking in the central corridor in the main title, with the
same identical shot in "Soul Hunter."  The widescreen is not a cropped
image; there's more on either side.  Ditto other shots in that opening.
