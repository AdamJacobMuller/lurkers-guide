<H2>nit-picking, my 2 cents worth.</H2>
3 Feb 1994<PRE>     We considered for a while using lots of subtitles, but the problem
is that this is a fairly dialogue-intensive show, and after about 10
exchanges of dialogue, it becomes hard to keep up with subtitles.  The
other problem is that there is a large viewership, particularly in SF
circles, of blind people, and thus subtitles seemed a bit unfair.
