13 Feb 1994<PRE>     Re: Delenn's alien-esque qualities...I have two photos from the set
that are favorites.  I was walking through the offices to the stage, when
I saw Mira in full make up in her Grey Council robes, picking up the day's
shooting schedule.  I saw her, said hi from down the hall, raised the
camera.  I snapped a picture.  Raised the camera again.  And in that one
instant, she straightened, lowered her chin, something about her face and
her body language absolutely altered.  I snapped a second photo.
 
     Photo #1 is a picture of Mira Furlan made up to look like a Minbari.
Photo #2 is a picture of Delenn.
 
     Damndest thing I'ved ever seen....
