<H2>(JMS) Research Grants</H2>
22 Feb 1994<PRE>     Thanks.  And agreed; the state of research grants, particularly for
pure-research, but even for more practical applications, is in sorry
shape.  Other nations invest *massive* amounts of money into research and
development, we invest pennies...and we wonder why we're falling behind.
 No one's looking ahead.  It's tragic, and worse than tragic, it's
dirt-stick-stone stupid.  My condolences.
