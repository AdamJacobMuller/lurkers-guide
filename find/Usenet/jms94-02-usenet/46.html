<H2>Clive Revill on next week's ep</H2>
7 Feb 1994<PRE>      Correct, Clive Revill is in "Born to the Purple" this week.  We've
actually had a *lot* of quality actors, drawn by the material, in our
first season: Clive, David McCallum, David Warner, June Lockhart,
Theodore Bickell, Morgan Shepherd, William Sanderson, Judson Scott and
Walter Koenig, to name but a few.
