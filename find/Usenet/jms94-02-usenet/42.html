<H2>Re: Opening Narration</H2>
5 Feb 1994<PRE>     Nope, "Purple" wasn't moved up to replace "Infection."  The former
was always scheduled for #3, followed by the latter.  The episodes for
this first batch were put together to alternate action/character,
so "Midnight" has lots of action, there's a fair amount in "Soul," so
we give a break in "Purple."  Then lots of action in "Infection," not as
much in "Parliament," and "Mind War" is an absolute blow out.
 
     These first six are really very much stand-alones, and fairly
straightforward.  Starting with "Parliament," we *really* begin to cook,
though.  The concern was that if we started out too complex, we might
lose a lot of people.  Better to bring them in gradually.  Starting from
"Parliament" onward, each episode gets more ambitious as well, in terms
of character, story, EFX, sets, you name it, to where we've got 3
stories running in "Mind War," all interesting, all with great
performances, nifty character moments, and killer EFX.  That's why I've
made it a point to say, just stick with us for the first six.  If you
don't like what you see after that...you're not going to.  I don't think
anyone should support a show just because it's SF.
 
     (Though that's not much of a risk here; I've *seen* "Parliament" and
"Mind War," y'see....)
