<H2>SPOILERS:The Parliament of Dre</H2>
23 Feb 1994<PRE>     "There was one big plot hole: Na'Toth should not have had such an
easy time convincing the assassin that she had been assigned as backup."
 
     Hmm...as I recall the episode, she *didn't* convince him at all, and
in fact was inches away from having him blow her brains out when G'Kar
came barrelling down the hall at them....
 
     Just a thought.
