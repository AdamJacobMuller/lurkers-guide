<H2>Soul Hunter comments</H2>
15 Feb 1994<PRE>     In my original B5 material, the leader of the Grey Council was always
Dukhat, going back 7 years.  I saw no reason to change it.  The moment I
begin whipsawing my show back and forth to avoid tripping over somebody
else, I'm just going to end up tripping over my own two feet.
 
     And that was Johnny Sekka's actual accent (he's Nigerian-born).
