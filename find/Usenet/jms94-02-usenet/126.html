<H2>Re: Babylon 5 Grade Report: "M</H2>
16 Feb 1994<PRE>     For what it's worth, in "Raiding Party," there's a line or two of
dialogue mentioning that the Raider ships are meant for atmospheric and
space maneuvering, with the recommendation that someone "aim for the
airfoils," as that's the most vulnerable spot.  So that *is* specified at
one point.
