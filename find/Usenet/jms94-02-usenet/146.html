<H2>Stupid Question in "Infection"</H2>
22 Feb 1994<PRE>     Actually, the reporter's question was *not* (from a 2258 point of
view) stupid.  Earth is far enough from the other major races not to
have to worry about iminent invasion.  At the time of the story, there is
a VERY strong isolationist movement growing back home, which you'll hear
more about as we go in.  Space travel is *expensive*, even in 2258, and
there are still a lot of problems to be resolved back home.  While the
Earth administration in Earthdome keeps pressing to go further and
further, various nation/states in the Earth senate are taxed further to
finance explorations which they don't always share in equally, the Mars
Colony is threatening secession...things are falling apart by degrees.
So in light of all that, the question is *absolutely* valid.
