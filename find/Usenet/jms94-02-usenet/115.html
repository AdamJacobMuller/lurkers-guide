<H2>Q: JMS:  Station ownership</H2>
18 Feb 1994<PRE>     The EA has owned all of the Babylons; 1-3 were sabotaged early in
construction, so it wasn't too much of a loss.  They dumped a BIG budget
into B4, and when that died, barely passed the budget for #5, skimping all
the way, cutting it down to bare bones operating expenses.  They will and
would never approve a #6.
