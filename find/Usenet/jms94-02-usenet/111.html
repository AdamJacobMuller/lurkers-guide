<H2>To JMS: They still use paper?</H2>
18 Feb 1994<PRE>     It's not a paper,but synthetic material.  A customized (to each
person) copy of UT comes out in your quarters, you take it with you, read
it, dump it in the recycler and get it again the next day.  And the
"help" given by EA to bronze-tech worlds is on a "whether you want it or
not" basis.  No prime directive here.
