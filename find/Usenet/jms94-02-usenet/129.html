<H2>Re: "Midnight" reactions</H2>
16 Feb 1994<PRE>     There was a problem with the initial episodes using the garden: we
kept turning in good looking shots, and couldn't figure out why they
looked weird later.  Turns out that the people at the color lab/video
transfer facility (one person in particular) kept adjusting the color and
gamma TO MATCH HIS MONITOR.  We finally found out about this and yelled.
