<H2>Mojo answers FX question</H2>
11 Feb 1994<PRE>     Mojo...Mojo...c'mere, Mojo...I wanna talk to you...siddown...no,
look, I'm not gonna hurt you, Mojo...Mojo...we don't film the live
action stuff on this show in 3:1 aspect ratio.  It's widescreen, Mojo.
Super 1:78:1.  Go pick up a copy of dailies, Mojo, it's right at the
start of the tape.  We crop the sides for normal broadcast.  Look at the
main title, Mojo, notice a slight difference between the main title
shots from "Parliament" and the broadcast version in the episode
itself...like...IT'S SUBSTANTIALLY WIDER AT EITHER END?!
 
     Don't run, Mojo...come back...stand still...it's just a baseball
bat, Mojo...we're gonna play a little game...Mojo...Mojo...COME BACK HERE!
