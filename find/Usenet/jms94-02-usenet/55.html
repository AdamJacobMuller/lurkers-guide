<H2>Ivanavah is my hero</H2>
10 Feb 1994<PRE>     I like Ivanova as well; she's got a very sly, very *sharp*
intelligence going there.  She can deadpan you and whap you upside the
head with a comment delivered almost as an aside, or an afterthought.
It's the difference between wit and humor.  She doesn't tell jokes, but
she's got a great sense of wit.
