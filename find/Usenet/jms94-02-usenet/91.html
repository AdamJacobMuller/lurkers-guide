<H2>Re: B5 comments (spoilers)</H2>
15 Feb 1994<PRE>     You ask, "Why would the Earth Alliance act this way?"  The question
is, why *wouldn't* they?  Minus some limited supplementary contributions
from the Centauri and the Minbari, the EA pays for this.  It's their
dollar, they get to call the shots.  This isn't the Federation, where
everyone's equally part of things.  The EA provides B5 as a service to
other species, and as a meeting place.  It reflects the priorities and
to some extent the prejudices of those who built it.  No, it's not a
perfect or polite setup.  Nobody said it had to be.  Nor do I feel it HAS
to be perfect or polite.
