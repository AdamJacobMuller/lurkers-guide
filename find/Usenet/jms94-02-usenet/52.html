<H2>Re: Midnight: thoughts...</H2>
8 Feb 1994<PRE>     Actually, only a portion of the music for any given episode of B5
consists of synthesized music.  Much of it is performed by Christopher's
orchestra in Berlin, which is hooked via digital lines to his studio here
in town.  Not all, certainly, but more than you might think is from that
live orchestra.
