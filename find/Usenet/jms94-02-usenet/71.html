<H2>Re: soul hunter, ferengis &amp; fi</H2>
12 Feb 1994<PRE>     You're correct; information is *not* willingly shared among the
various races.  It's hoarded and used and sold.  And yes, humans would
probably have *heard* of Soul Hunters, distantly, as a legend.  I see no
reason why they would believe they existed, particularly with a title
like that, unless and until actually encountering one.
