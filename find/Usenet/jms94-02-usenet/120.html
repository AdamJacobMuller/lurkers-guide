<H2>JMS: Psi Corps Symbol</H2>
20 Feb 1994<PRE>     Er...the symbol Lyta wears isn't "an interconnected IU that looks
an awful lot like the greek 'psi,'" ...it *IS* the Greek letter Psi, as
is appropriate for a group of telepaths.  That was always our intent.
(Funnily enough, while in college getting my first degree in Clinical
Psychology, I belonged to Psi Chi, the national honor society in
psychology.  Small world.)
