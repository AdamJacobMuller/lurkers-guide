25 Feb 1994<PRE>     No, Wednesday was just the day she was due to return; she mentions
that her next job has to be finished by Tuesday, and this makes
Wednesday the next day she could see him.

     I'm not terribly enamored of Landis, and would not deliberately
stick ANY reference to his work in an episode of mine.

                                                                 jms
