<H2>Soul Hunter -- B+ / D (Spoiler</H2>
8 Feb 1994<PRE>     When you say that you don't understand how the small thrust of the
coffin could've carried it away from the statino since "anything
released from the statin must also be in orbit," I can't help but wonder
how closely you were paying attention.  A shuttle leaves B5, and moves
well away from the station, and the coffin is launched from the shuttle,
NOT from B5.
