<H2>Infection (spoilers)</H2>
20 Feb 1994<PRE>     I allow a small smile...in the course of any given script, I put in
little things that I figure nobody will ever notice, but which for me
help just a bit to keep on track with the character, and which may
resonate to anyone paying attention.  You cite Sinclair's line about
joining Garibaldi "on the LINE," and Garibaldi noting that Sinclair keeps
putting his life "on the LINE," and the similarity to the phrase "the
Battle of the Line."
 
     It was a throwaway...but a conscious one.
 
     He's still fighting the same battle.  He's never stopped.  In one way
or another, he keeps putting himself out there, caught in a loop....
