<H2>Re: ALIEN ACCENTS</H2>
22 Feb 1994<PRE>     I quote your message verbatim: "What kind of accent (besides FAKE and
FORCED) does the membari (spelling?) lady use?  I mean, what country on
earth did they model her character's accent from?"
 
     (rolling up sleeves)  Allow me to show you why you are an idiot.
 
     There is a tendency, among the cerebrally impaired, to automatically
decide that whatever they don't like is fake, or forced, or cheesy, when
they are simply ignorant of what it means, or what it is.  Because it
isn't instantly familiar, doesn't instantly match what they've seen before,
they -- like you -- assume it's being done incorrectly.
 
     Mira Furlan is a native-born Yugoslavian (back when that was the
name of the country).  She came to this country only a year or two ago,
fleeing for her life.  She had been that nation's premiere actress, having
won any number of major awards, including the Palm d'Or at Cannes.  But
because she refused to endorse either side in that bloodbath, she was
hunted by both.
 
     The "fake and forced" accent to which you refer...is her native
accent.
 
     Maybe next time you will take the required moment to *think* before
shooting off your mouth, and phrase your question in order to get the
required information before making allegations based on your own lack of
said information.  One doesn't always have to attack something unfamiliar
or insult someone's ability just because you don't like something.
 
     Because from time to time, you'll prove yourself a boob.
 
     Like this time.
 
                                                                  jms
