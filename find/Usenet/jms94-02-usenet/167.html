25 Feb 1994<PRE>     The video noise and audio problem is apparently happening between
the time we deliver the episode on D2s and when it's uplinked to the
stations.  Apparently the show goes through 5 more generations, in order
to add in commercials (1 pass), add in closed-captioning (another copy),
and so on.  We're trying to track it down and see where in the process
the glitch is happening.

                                                                     jms
