<H2>Re: BABYLON 5 To Include Gay/B</H2>
23 Feb 1994<PRE>     Let me put this as simply as I can...in the year 2258, nobody *cares*
about your sexual orientation.  It doesn't come up.  No one makes an issue
out of it.  There are no discussions, no proclamations, no inquiries, no
"how will they react?"  It's like being left-handed or right-handed; no
one really cares one way or another.
 
     Can we now move on past all of this?
 
                                                                      jms
