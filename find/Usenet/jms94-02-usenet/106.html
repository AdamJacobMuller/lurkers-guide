<H2>Re: Ban on creative works? Huh</H2>
17 Feb 1994<PRE>     "Why can't I write a story using the characters from B5 and publish
it here for all to read?"
 
     Because it's a violation of copyright and trademark.  What part of
that sentence don't you understand?
 
     If you write a story and -- using your own terms -- "publish it here"
that instance of commonlaw copyright is a violation of the PTEN copyright
and trademark.  My own personal feelings notwithstanding, *it's the law*.
 
     The only thing that really bothers me in this whole conversation is
that I didn't want to get into a discussion of legalities, or lawyers, or
copyright infringement...all I said at the beginning was that I would like
to be here, to stay here, to participate in this experiment.  And I asked,
as a courtesy, to be kept away from any story ideas because it opens me
up to legal liability.  That's all.  Just a courtesy, in exchange for the
3 hours a day I spend on this system, reading 500 messages a day now, to
keep the lines of communication open.
 
     Why is the request for a courtesy insufficient, and people have to
go to the legal aspect?
