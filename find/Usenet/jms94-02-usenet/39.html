<H2>So when does the merchandising</H2>
4 Feb 1994<PRE>     Frankly, I'm not in any hurry to see the show merchandised, though
we're up to our ears in inquiries.  I think it's important, at least in
the early stages, to keep all that stuff at arm's length.  Otherwise you
end up in a situation where the tail begins wagging the dog.  Let's make
the series as good as we can, first, and then worry about the toys later.
