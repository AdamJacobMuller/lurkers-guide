Some of it's landing on your feet, some of it is a conscious decision from day
one to allow the random incidents of real life to affect the show, whether it's
an actor leaving, someone breaking a leg, whatever.  It adds a sense of
realism, rather than recasting or just ignoring the situation.  It's a
challenge, no mistake, but it leads in some very cool directions.
