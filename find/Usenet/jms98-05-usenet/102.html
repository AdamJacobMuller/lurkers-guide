<H2>Re: Attn JMS: Movie scripts</H2>
20 May 1998<PRE>Actually, I think where my episodes have had problems has been where I've had
too much time to think about them, and second guess myself.  The more time
between starting it and finishing it, the more I tend to lose the fingerprints
of the characters and the situation.  Both the examples you cite, for instance,
were that way, and suffered from too MUCH tinkering on my part, frankly.

As for the feature...that one is going to be the object of some considerable
attention from me.  I'll probably do what I tend to do for special stuff
(should it get into development): noodle it and play with it and outline stuff
until finally it refuses to wait any longer, then take a week or so and do
nothing else but burn through the draft, then stick it in a box for another
week, not look at it, then come back and pretend somebody else wrote it and
tear it to shreds, then rebuild.
