27 May 1998<PRE>Thank you for those wonderful words.  If fans of this show can carry some of
what they find here out into the real world -- building communities, asking
questions, building the future *consciously* rather than letting others do it
for you -- then that is the best testament, and the only thanks, that could
ever be required.
