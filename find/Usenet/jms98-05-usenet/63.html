&gt;&gt; To make the experience of viewing TNT programming
&gt;&gt;less painful for your fans, have you considered writing some

&gt;&gt;successful episode -- could you "redeem" yourself here?
&gt;
&gt;&gt;The wrestler Sting appears to be a Crow knock-off.  Are you open to the
&gt;&gt;possibility of professional wrestlers dressing as Narns or Minbari?
&gt;&gt;How about the Nitro Fly Girls dressed as Centauri slaves?  I think
&gt;&gt;someone wrestling in a Vorlon encounter suit would be interesting.
&gt;&gt;

&gt;So...have the drugs worn off, or are they just kicking in...?

ready to help in his detoxification.  

Only they use the Wood, not Gold, Cure to drive out the toxins...
