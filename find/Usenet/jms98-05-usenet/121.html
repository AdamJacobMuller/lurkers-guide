24 May 1998<PRE>&gt;But...how easy is it for you to switch gears?  While writing itself is
&gt;simply telling a story, each medium calls for a completely different set of
&gt;rules and processes.  
&gt;	Do you find yourself, for example, saying "I think I'm in my
novel-writing
&gt; mood today"..?
&gt;Or do you, being a somewhat obvious workaholic who just loves what he
&gt;does, find it easy to pick up any of these projects at any given time and
&gt;jump in full steam?

What happens is that my main goal for the evening is, say, writing a B5 script.
 I'll come to a point in it where I'll have to sit back and stew over what
comes next, how to pull it off.  It's often easy to know WHAT you want to do,
it's the HOW that's hard (worse still if you want to do the HOW *well*.)

That's strictly subconscious stuff, letting the brain chew on it, so while
that's going on, I'll go work on something else, or jump on the nets, whatever
it takes so I *don't* leave the keyboard and go watch TV, since I can lose
several hours that way.

Which one I pick depends on who I want to play with that day.  This week I've
been spending my "thinking" time on my play, just a page or two here and there,
no rush.
