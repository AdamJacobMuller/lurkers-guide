<H2>B5 Fan Club Addition</H2>
15 May 1998<PRE>As the fan club has expanded and been reworked, we've worked to play catch-up
on orders, improve the site, and increase the numbers and quality of in-house
products.  To that end, we've just brought on someone who will run the thing
full time, instead of all of us pitching in part-time.  

The new addition is Julie Walker, previously head of the MST3K fan club. 
Knowing both the fan area and the environment, she should be a huge help in
getting us to the next level.
