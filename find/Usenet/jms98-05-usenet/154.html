<H2>Re: Noble Dignity in Meditations</H2>
31 May 1998<PRE>&gt;Now 
&gt;I have returned to read this, with the rhythms of Corwin still ringing in my 
&gt;ears and through my veins -- and what I hear is one of Corwin's spiritual
&gt;sons at work while at leisure, here on the Net!  

(allows a quiet smile)

There are a number of us who call ourselves Norman's Kids; we who drew on his
inspiration and his words.  Others who have so identified themselves in one way
or another are Ray Bradbury, Rod Serling, Charles Kuralt, Edward R Murrow,
Walter Cronkite, Stan Freberg and many, many others.

Every once in a while, I'll think that something I've done reads a little bit
close to something Norman Corwin would've written, and excusing the hubris of
that, it's a tough goal to hit.
