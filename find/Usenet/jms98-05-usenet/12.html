10 May 1998<PRE>I don't know, no one's said anything to me about it yet, but it's a bit early
for that.

Personally, I think that a build-up to the end of the show would be great,
although "Sleeping in Light" isn't exactly a big-bang lots of explosions kind
of episode, so it might not be as promotable in that sense.
