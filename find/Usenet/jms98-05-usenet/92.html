<H2>Re: ATTN JMS - Babylon 5 Wars and Babylon Project</H2>
20 May 1998<PRE>One of the things we've begun doing is to start coordinating more closely all
the licensees, and there are going to have to be some revisions in the game
books to bring them into line with the overall story, and other licensees.  We
just recently brought on a reference editor whose job it is to catalog every
bit of information between licensees, and between B5 and the licensees, and
start making it as canonical and consistent as possible.  It's a hideous job,
but we're determined to do it.
