<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: The Official Guide to J. Michael Straczynski's Babylon</H2>
21 May 1998<PRE>&gt;1) Why the guide contains no Government\Alien data on Vorlons or
&gt;Shadows?
&gt;
&gt;2) Why the guide contains no character reference to Morden, Bester,
&gt;Kosh, Lorien, Sinclair all crucial characters but does contain data on
&gt;Timothy Chase and Ashi Van Troc - each of whom had a 2 minute segment
&gt;in one episode (Long Twilight Struggle and Dust To Dust resp.)
&gt;3) Why the guide contains no pictures of Vorlon or Shadow ships?
&gt;
Because the guide is set in the time period of the fifth season; it is a guide
to B5 *as it is in the fifth year* of the show, at which point the Vorlons and
the Shadows are all gone.  We had to choose which year in which to set the
thing, because of folks going in and out of the story.  We took the conceit
that this is the kind of thing that someone arriving at the station would
reasonbly or conceivably get.  It isn't a guide to the history of B5, it's a
guide to the station, and who's in it, in season 5.
