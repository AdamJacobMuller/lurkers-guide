<H2>Re: Crusade: A Fiscal Repackaging of B5</H2>
12 May 1998<PRE>Another flaw in this argument -- other than the fact that Cronan totally misses
the point of the entire original message of mine he took as his own and
misappropriated, because it is in his vested INTERESTS to miss the point -- is
that in point of fact, Crusade is going to cost MORE than B5.  DS9 was planned
to cost less than TNG going in, that was one of the points at hand (whether or
not it actually did cost less, I don't know, but that was the apparent intent).

The first year budget on Crusade is substantially more than for B5's last
season, and all the previous seasons (and we're going back to a 7 day shooting
schedule), because in this case we're going to a lot of new alien worlds and
locations, and that costs more.  So the premise of doing another show because
it wiil cost less is invalid on the face of it.

Not that matters to Cronan, because nothing matters to Cronan other than Cronan
and his obsession with riding this show and looking for any possible
opportunity to rag on it, me, and those who enjoy it.  

It's getting old, Cronan (or whatever your real name is).  I don't know what
your problem is, but get over it.
