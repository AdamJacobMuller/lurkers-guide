<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Royalties question</H2>
24 May 1998<PRE>&gt; a one second clip of the Babylon 5 station.  So my
&gt;question is: who gets paid for this use of WB copyrighted material, how
&gt;often do they get paid (one lump sum, every time the image is shown, etc.)
&gt;and about how much would they get paid?

If I recall correctly, they asked for and received a waiver, so as far as I
know, there's no money involved at all.
