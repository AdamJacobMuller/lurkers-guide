<H2>Re: Crusade: A Fiscal Repackaging of B5</H2>
12 May 1998<PRE>There is no point in replying further to you, Cronan, because the replies would
mean nothing to you because you don't care about the content of the replies. 
You say that you're here as a fan of the show, but in fact in the unmoderated
group you've been ragging on B5 and its fans and jumping in with Holland and
Theron and Ford and the rest of the dysfunctional gang over there for a long
time before you decided to stick your snout in here. 

You don't care about a reasoned discussion, you don't want a reasoned
discussion, you're here simply to troll, to get a rise out of people, myself
included.  

Since you found it amusing to call up my own post, I decided to pull out your
public replies from the unmoderated group concerning all this.  Do we see here
the comments of someone generally concerned abou the show?  Or do we see here
someone who is enjoying getting a rise out of people, someone who is doing this
only to cause upset?

I quote (the non-bracketed comments are your own words:
*********
&gt;But look at all the willing little fishes, with their open gulping mouths!

Silly boy.

&gt;Personally, I would have avoided introducing any "new" words of my own into
&gt;JMS', just to keep it purer, for a stronger backlash when the critics come
&gt;snarling along behind.  But that's just me, and you do P&amp;SC better than I
&gt;ever could.

If I didn't do Cronan and you didn't do Infinity then we'd have serious
problems, wouldn't we. 

&gt;But look at all the willing little fishes, with their open gulping
mouths!

You people are out to embarass me.

&gt; ...why no AFT-S cross, you poop?  Was it something I said?  ;-)

Well this wasn't the kind of thing that you usually goes to AFT-S...
it is funnier than I'd hoped, BTW.

*********

You think it's funny.  You enjoy that your comments get these sorts of
reactions from the "little fishes."  You say you're being quite open here about
who you are, that it has nothing to do with your comments...and then you say
that if you "didn't DO Cronan" you'd have serious problems.  Hardly the sort of
thing one says about one's own name now is it?  I find that a very interesting
statement, and a telling contradiction.

A fan of the show?  No.  A troll?  Yes.  

And I have far more interesting things to do with my life than deal with
trolls.  Go find another target, Cronan.  I'm not buying, and I'm not  playing.
