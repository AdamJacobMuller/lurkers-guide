<H2>Re: Crusade Newsgroup - Moderated</H2>
25 May 1998<PRE>&gt;An example in B5 context:  what if I posted "JMS, I think the
&gt;overall quality of Season 5 has suffered substantially because of
&gt;a lack of good dialogue editting."  Is that a flame?

Nope.

&gt;What if I said,
&gt;"I think JMS suffers from Tom Clancy syndrome sometimes, and the
&gt;quality of the show would improve if someone less personally attached
&gt;to every word of dialogue were brought in to edit."

Annoying, but not a flame.
&gt; Or what if
&gt;I said "The ending of the Shadow War sucked!  Why on earth would these
&gt;two exceedingly powerful species suddenly start listening to our
&gt;opinions and meekly taking our suggestions?  Totally ruined my
&gt;suspension of disbelief!"?  Is that a troll?

Nope.
