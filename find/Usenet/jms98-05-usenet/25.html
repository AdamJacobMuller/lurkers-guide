12 May 1998<PRE>"Of course everything has already been said.  But since no one was listening,
we must begin again."  I don't recall the source of the quote offhand, but it
applies here.

There are billions of published words out there.  But no two people put them
together in the same way.  That's the important difference.  You can't measure
yourself against others in that respect; you can only figure out what you want
to say.  If you say it interestingly, others will read it; if not, not.
