<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Sequel theories/Pros &amp; Cons</H2>
20 May 1998<PRE>&gt;This reminds me of the response given during Prime Minister's Question Time:
&gt;I
&gt;refer the right honourable gentleman (or woman) to the response I gave some
&gt;moments before.
&gt;
&gt;A very civilized response.

Which is about where the civilized part ends...having watched a fair amount of
Prime Minister's Question Time on CSPAN, I have to say it beats professional
wrestling any day of the week.

I understand only about half of what's under discussion, but it's pretty damned
entertaining nonetheless.
