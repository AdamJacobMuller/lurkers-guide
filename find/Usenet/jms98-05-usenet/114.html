<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: In The Beginning Merchandise</H2>
23 May 1998<PRE>&gt;I was wondering if there were plans for releasing an
&gt;In The Beginning musc CD, since a lot of the music was amazing stuff.

We've talked about it, and I know he'd like to do it, so it's a matter of time,
I suppose.

&gt;Is Franke also creating a large
&gt;score for the B5 game?

Yup.
