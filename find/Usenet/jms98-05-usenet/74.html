<H2>Re: B5 Fan Club Addition</H2>
15 May 1998<PRE>&gt;Just wondering, what kind of background, schooling, experience and
&gt;such is normally needed to fall into this line of work?  Any idea?  It's easy
&gt;to
&gt;guess what kind of background a secretary, doctor, lawyer, etc. needs - I
&gt;just am
&gt;curious about this kind of work as a profession

It's an odd mix...one has to have a knowledge of the fans that is based on real
experience, but not be a "fanboy" (if I can use that term) where it can become
about self-aggrandizement...you have to want to serve the needs of the fans,
and the company.  Also you have to be a business manager, able to pull together
a real, honest to god company and expand it.  Sort of a fan technomage.  That
she had been involved with a fan club based on a TV series, and made it into a
going concern, was crucial to her selection.
