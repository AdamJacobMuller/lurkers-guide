14 May 1998<PRE>&gt;&gt; For TV you have to live in LA; for films, you can go in and out.
&gt;
&gt;For *United States*-oriented TV, maybe.
&gt;
&gt;For example, things have improved in Toronto since your last visit here.

Yes, well, when the person asked about LA, I assumed they were interested in
matters pertaining to the United States.
