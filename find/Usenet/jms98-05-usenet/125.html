<H2>Re: ATTN. JMS:  Cookies?</H2>
25 May 1998<PRE>I like oatmeal cookies, oatmeal/raisin cookies, chocolate cookies, mud pie
cookies, and chocolate chip cookies.  Not big on biscuits or hard cookies.

However, that said...sometimes folks very generously send me packages of
cookies and the like, but unless I know the person sending them to me VERY
well, they have to go out, because you should never put anything in your mouth
unless you know where it came from.
