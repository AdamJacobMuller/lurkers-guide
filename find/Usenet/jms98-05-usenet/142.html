<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: How Do You Read a Book?</H2>
28 May 1998<PRE>&gt;1) How do you approach reading -- do you read novels differently
&gt;than manuals?
&gt;
&gt;
Not that I'm aware of consciously, no.  I guess I go to a manual looking for
information, and I go to *enjoy* a novel.

I have to be careful doing research, because after a while I find that the
facts get in the way of the *telling*...it's like, "Okay, I just spent $300 on
books about this stuff, and now YOU'RE going to pay for it!"  I have to leave
it alone for a while until the notes go away and the sense of it remains.

&gt;2) How did you transform the passage in _Le Morte DArthur_ to the
&gt;poignant counterpoint in B5?  Did you read the Cliff's Notes?
&gt;Was there some other play, book, etc. (i.e., _Excalibur_) that
&gt;moved you?

I guess the difference is that a writer of fiction or scripts has to put him-
or herself into the scene, to feel what someone else has described in technical
terms.  From that comes emotion, from emotion comes contact.
