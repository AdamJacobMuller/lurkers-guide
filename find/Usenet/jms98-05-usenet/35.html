<H2>Re: JMS: Question on a convention</H2>
15 May 1998<PRE>The primary folks running the Voice of the Resistance con are the same ones
behind the Wolf conventions, which I'm actively boycotting until a) I hear from
the fans that the way fans are treated there has improved, and b) until I get
the promised accouting from the two conventions I attended, both of which were
supposed to turn over the profits to local charities, both of whom were
supposed to provide accountings when requested, neither of which has yet been
done.  I want to be sure that the funds raised went where they were intended,
in the full amounts.
