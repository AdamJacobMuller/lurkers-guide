10 May 1998<PRE>Del Rey Books will be coming out with a novelization of ThirdSpace in a little
bit (also by Peter David), Yvonne Navarro has just started working on the
novelization of The River of Souls, and John Gregory Keyes is doing the first
planned original B5 trilogy around the birth of the Psi Corps (it covers about
100 years), based on my outlines.  More are also in the works, including
another trilogy based on the fall of Centauri Prime.
