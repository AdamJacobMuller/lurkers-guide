<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: An Unusual Thank You</H2>
28 May 1998<PRE>&gt;I pondered that for a long time, and finally I came to see that the
&gt;*truly* important bits of writing are integrity, honesty, craft, and
&gt;heart.  I bought your scriptwriting book, which both reinforced this view
&gt;and made me see that there are a lot of interesting stories I could tell.

You can tell a good story in just about any venue, provided you approach it
with, as Balzac said, "clean hands and composure."  What matters is what you DO
with the form, not the form itself.

&gt; I and my guests had fun, the actors had fun, and ... the audience
&gt;laughed themselves silly, threw marshmellows, booed, cheered, and fell in
&gt;love.  I'm getting paid for this, and hope to sell it to a play-publishing
&gt;company in the next few weeks.

That's the real key: have fun with it, and do what you want, and the rest tends
to take care of itself.

Or to quote AnthonyHopkins quoting somebody else, "Be bold, and mighty forces
will come to your aid."
