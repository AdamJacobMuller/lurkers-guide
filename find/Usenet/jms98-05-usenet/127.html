<H2>Re: Att JMS, pls: "writing" question?</H2>
25 May 1998<PRE>&gt;what part of "writing" are you referring to here? The "smashing words
&gt;together to see what happens" (another paraphrase, I think, but close
&gt;enough) or the storytelling part?
&gt;
&gt;

I can't really separate them out.  There's foreplay and there's sex, and in a
way they're both the same thing, same process, so to me it's all the same
thing.

&gt;If you had to stop writing fiction, would you turn to a) writing
&gt;non-fiction, or b) some other form or storytelling? or are the two so
&gt;closely entwined that neither would satisfy you without the other, and
&gt;we'd be left with that "JMS-puff of smoke"?
&gt;
&gt;

I'd find something.  If not scripts, then novels; if not novels, then short
stories; if not stories, then articles; if not articles, then songs; if not
songs, then plays...I get nervous when I ain't writing, and one way or another,
I'd find something.
