20 May 1998<PRE>&gt;One, this week's _Zocalo_ quotes you as saying that the last bit of work
&gt;was done on B5 the Series as of May 15. 
&gt;
&gt;Congratulations! and thank you again for being living proof that a person
&gt;with a plan *can* beat the system, if they are willing to make the
&gt;committment and the sacrifices

Thanks...it's been tough, but worth it.

&gt;n a recent post, you
&gt;mentioned that Usenet tolerates pathological behavior which the "paying
&gt;services" are less likely to put up with. 
&gt;
&gt;Does this mean that you'll be more active on the private nets than this
&gt;public forum, although in a reduced amount in all places, due to time
&gt;constraints?

Dunno...haven't really thought that far ahead yet.
