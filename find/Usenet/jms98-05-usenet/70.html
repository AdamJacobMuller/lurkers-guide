<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: status of  the non-Babylon work</H2>
15 May 1998<PRE>&gt;It's been a while since you've said anything about it, but are you going to 
&gt;get the time (with Crusade approved) to finish that other novel you were 
&gt;talking about?
&gt;
&gt;

I'm working and have been working on a number of other, non-B5 projects (such
as the short story that just came out in a mystery anthology), but they're all
long-term projects that proceed at a page or two a day, as I have time for
them.  There's a novel, a short story collection, a play, other stuff...but the
show has to come first, so it'll be a while before anything happens to them.
