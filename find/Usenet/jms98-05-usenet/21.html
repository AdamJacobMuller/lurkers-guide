<H2>Re: Crusade: A Fiscal Repackaging of B5</H2>
12 May 1998<PRE>
You are obviously posting this to try and throw back my words at me about DS9,
made several years ago, being without any new vision behind it.  Because that's
all you're really capable of, trying to come up with new cheap shots.

My message at the time dealt specifically with a context which you ignore: TNG
was created by Gene Roddenberry (with some considerable help from David
Gerrold); those who followed then took those elements and repackaged them into
DS9 without actually *inventing* much: it was all made by someone else with a
vision (Roddenberry, who also had the original ST vision).

It was a new show, but not a new vision, because that vision was created before
then, by others.  Hence, my comments at that time.

In this case, the person who created the original vision of the Babylon 5
universe (which would be me) is still alive.

That's why the context in such a discussion is everything; the single message
from me out of the context of the whole discussion results in missing the
entire point: my feeling at that time that those making DS9 didn't bring much
new to that show that was not created by others, who were no longer alive.

And by the way, if you're going to steal my words, and put them in your message
(while twisting the context) and pretend that they're your own, that's called
plagiarism.

Why don't you just give it a rest, Cronan?  And by the way, why don't you post
your real name some time?  You sit there and snipe from the shadows constantly,
attacking me and others in this forum, many of whose names are known...it takes
a certain kind of coward to do this kind of crap from behind the safety of
anonymity.  If you feel so strongly about your opinions, which you shove around
as if they mattered, then you should be prepared to stand behind them.  You
search out my posts by my name and twist them around, why not give us the same
luxury by giving us your real name?

Either you believe in the rightness of your opinions, in which case you should
have no problem standing behind them, or you do not, in which case you are a
coward.  Which is it?
