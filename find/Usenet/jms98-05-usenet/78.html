Yeah, I've heard it, but the details are fuzzy, and fairly elaborate, so it's
best for me not even to try and recount them.

As for the address to use for me...the B5 mail drop is fine, though soon I'll
be shunting all that over to the main B5 fan mail address.  For now, send it to
my attention, c/o Babylon 5, 14431 Ventura Boulevard, Suite 260, Sherman Oaks,
CA 91423.
