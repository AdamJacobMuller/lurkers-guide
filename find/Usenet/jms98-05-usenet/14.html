<H2>Re: article on JMS's MIT visit</H2>
10 May 1998<PRE>&gt;Occurs to me that I can't think of a current scifi show that does. Nope.
&gt;Thinking about no scifi show currently in production has "cute kids and
&gt;robts as regulars." It's pretty wierd that JMS empahsizes this when it is
&gt;true of every show on the air. Even the ones that are worse than B5 has ever
&gt;been.

Sisko's kid son in Deep Space Nine, and the Ferengi kid in the same series.

That's two kids in the same show.

Maybe the problem is not in the proposition as advanced, but rather in your
thinking.
