<H2>Re: Arc of JMS</H2>
19 May 1998<PRE>&gt;I want to clarify something from my earlier post, and the reply from
&gt;JMS.
&gt;
&gt;It was not intended as an attack that the man has changed over time in
&gt;his public responses on the net.  It was an observation that the tone of
&gt;his posts has changed, nothing more.

I never took it as anything else.
