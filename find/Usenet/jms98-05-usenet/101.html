<H2>Re: The Death of Civility</H2>
20 May 1998<PRE>Tim: sure, you can just choose to ignore it when someone does you a disservice,
when they malign you or smear you...that's an option.

Only problem with it, is that it doesn't work.

For instance: over on the other group, a particular net-kook posted a message
citing a supposed contract between me and AOL in which I would be paid to be
exclusively on AOL and thus would not be contributing anything to any usenet
group, and that THAT was the reason that I left the unmoderated group.

It was, of course, an unvarnished lie, of the kind I've come to expect from
such individuals.

The problem is that this isn't a big, obvious lie...it's a subtle one.  And as
a result, it got propagated and picked up around the nets, and I had to answer
a couple dozen angry email messages from users saying that I'd sold out to AOL.
 So tell me, how does ignoring that kind of thing solve anything?  

You say ignore 'em.  I say you can't just ignore this kind of crap, or you end
up condoning it by silence.  Difference in philosophy, that's all.
