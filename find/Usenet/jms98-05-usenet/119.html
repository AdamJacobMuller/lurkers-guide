<H2>Re: Plotline Arcs in Television Series</H2>
24 May 1998<PRE>&gt;Now that Babylon 5 has used the
&gt;plot-arc, and has shown that it can be done quite successfully, have any
&gt;other shows currently in production begun to use a predetermined arc?
&gt;One example may be Earth: Final Conflict; it definitely has an arc in
&gt;its development, but is the storyline for the series predetermined like
&gt;Babylon 5's?
&gt;
&gt;
Dark Skies was announced as using a five-year arc, and in a recent interview
with the producers (Starburst? TV zone?  one of those) of the Stargate series,
they've said they're trying to do a B5 arc approach, though not quite as
intensive.  I think it's great; the more we can add new tools, the more
diversity we get as viewers.
