<H2>Re: ATTN JMS:  Claudia at BayCon</H2>
26 May 1998<PRE>&gt;I didn't actually make it to BayCon this weekend, here in Silicon Valley,
&gt;but I saw a flyer indicating that Claudia Christian was supposed to be
&gt;present.  Do you have an opinion on her appearing as a "B5 representative"
&gt;at conventions?

I've never had a problem with it, though she obviously represents B5 as of the
first four seasons, not the fifth or thereafter...sort of the ghost of
Christians past....

(couldn't resist)
