<H2>Re: Attn Jms : Crusade Production Questions</H2>
26 May 1998<PRE>&gt;As my understanding goes, which may well be fallible, when a new
&gt;production starts it is the producer and the production designer who
&gt;get together to decide the feel and visual look of the show. 

Your understanding is correct.
&gt;John
&gt;Iacovelli (spelling?) was production designer on B5. Will he occupy
&gt;the same role on Crusade or will a new perspective be brought to the
&gt;table to freshen things up and provide something a little different?

No, John is still with the show, though we've brought in some new designers and
graphics people to work alongside the folks we've had from day one, so there's
definitely new blood (and the old blood ain't bad either).  

I've stood on, and we've shot in, the set for the Excalibur, and I think it may
be the coolest starship *I've* ever seen on film for TV, frankly.  

&gt;Also, how do things proceed from an outline\idea to fleshing out a
&gt;fully fledged production? How do the producer and production designer
&gt;pull everything together? How will the use of more virtual sets
&gt;influence what you guys are doing now?

It goes from the scripts.  For instance, the first script written will be the
third one produced, to allow more time for production design on some of the
elaborate set and other requirements.  And yes, we'll be doing more with
virtual sets.

&gt;Will you be using a script editor in Crusade, similar to the way Larry
&gt;De Tillio was used in seasons 1 and 2 of B5 before you started writing
&gt;all the episodes yourself?

Even when Larry was on B5, I ended up rewriting the script to one degree or
another, not to correct anything Larry did, 'cause he's one of the best, only
to bring it into line with my view of B5, which is eccentric and subjective at
best.  So at this point, there's no need to bring on a story editor, though
I'll be keeping my eye out for possibilities to serve in that capacity on later
seasons, once I find out who can write for this show and who can't.
