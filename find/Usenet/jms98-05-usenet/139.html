28 May 1998<PRE>&gt;She apparently wasn't having enough business or wasn't making a large enough
&gt;profit to make it worthwhile.  Also, the license she had to make uniforms had
&gt;expired and in order to renew it WB was asking for a great deal of money.
&gt;After hearing that, I lost a great deal of respect to WB.

The problem is that she was, in essence, a one-woman business, and the number
of costumes she could put out was *very* small, meaning that most of the fans
who wanted them wouldn't be able to get them.  Letting the license go to a
larger entity means that more people would be able to get them.
