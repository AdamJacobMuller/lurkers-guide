<H2>Re: B5, JMS and the net</H2>
21 May 1998<PRE>&gt;	As far as I can see, we are no longer talking about a place
&gt;where JMS is free from personal attacks.  We are beginning to discuss
&gt;a place where he is free from _creative criticism_.

Show me one post where I have said that.  You and Charles both.  Just one post.
 Any post.  Where?  

This is a straw man argument; I've never said it, have said exactly the
opposite on numerous occasions, and wouldn't want it.

Nor am I asking anyone to change anything here.

The topic came up.  I responded about what things are like at this end.  That
was the end of it.  Frankly, I've already heard from some in the satai mailing
list, and have told them I can't see what if anything could be changed, and
that I'm not *looking* for anything to get changed.

I was just talking about what this has been like.

Can we please stop the unjustified, unmerited straw man arguments now?
