<H2>Good Schedule News</H2>
12 May 1998<PRE>For starters, for those who haven't heard yet, there are 4 new episodes to air
starting May 27th.  They culminate in a hell of a dilemma at the end of the
four, and in many ways they are the first four in a five parter.  

The airing of The River of Souls has been pushed up to November 8th to allow it
and Sleeping in Light (November 25th) to be given more individual attention and
special promotion by TNT, so one won't get lost in the other.  It also means
less of a wait.

Also, when TNT starts rebroadcasting the whole 5th season starting the first
week of July, that will correspond with their debut of their new satellite
system, which will allow same-time broadcasts for both coasts...meaning the
fifth season episodes will be on at 8 p.m. on both coasts...AND they're adding
an 11 p.m. rebroadcast the same day to give folks the most flexibility with the
show, something that many of you have asked for.

TNT has been listening.
