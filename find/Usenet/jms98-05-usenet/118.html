24 May 1998<PRE>Thansk; in addition to that....

&gt;Thanks Joe, for all the truly
&gt;outsanding writing!  Not just on TV, either.  I have loved your
&gt;postings where you let out a little of yourself... the chocolate
&gt;loving, Parker pen using self... the opinions on music and the
&gt;off topic stuff all add to making it a fuller experience

Four words: Big Bad Voodoo Daddy.  If you liked Cherry Poppin' Daddies (and who
wouldn't?) you'll LOVE Big Bad Voodoo Daddy.
