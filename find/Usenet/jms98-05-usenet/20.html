<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Questions about Crusade Casting</H2>
12 May 1998<PRE>
&gt;The no-B5-regulars-in-crusade demand was made by TNT.  Someone said that
&gt;Bruce Boxleitner made some *choice* comments about that but I dont know
&gt;about that part for sure.
&gt;But im pretty sure JMS confirmed the TNT part of
&gt;it.  Check with Lurkers because something was put up on the nwes or crusade
&gt;guide page about it.  Again, I think JMS said something but I cant remember
&gt;if I found it here or elsewhere.

Absolutely, positively untrue.
