<H2>Re: vetoing glasses &amp; Calvin and Hobbes</H2>
26 May 1998<PRE>Resisting the impulse to just merchandise the hell out of the show from day
one, particularly in questionable areas, has certainly been ironic (and costly)
since the ONLY area I get an actual, real (if small) percentage of the show
(the studio will always work the books so it never shows a profit on paper) is
in merchandising.

&gt;And has there been any fake B5
&gt;merchandise spotted?

Plenty.  If you've bought a link or an EA insignia at a con, it's a fake.  All
patches sold other than through the B5 fan club are fake.  There's a huge
amount of fake 4th season posters that flooded in from Germany (you can tell
the fakes by checking the poster: if it's unusually heavy photoreproduction
paper, and the B5 logo is blurry...it's a fake).  The White Star models that
are out there are unlicensed...it goes on and on....
