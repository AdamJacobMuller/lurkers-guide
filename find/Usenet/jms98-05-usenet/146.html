<H2>Re: Meditations on the Abyss ( *Spoilers* )</H2>
29 May 1998<PRE>&gt;When Dr. Franklin explained his religious beliefs to G'Kar, he
&gt;said what I have always believed.  When you boil down all the 
&gt;religions currently known, they all come back to the same
&gt;basic tenets of good and evil.  It is only money and politics
&gt;that distort religion.  So, now I know I am a "Foundationist".

&gt;For years, I have been looking for a way to define my 
&gt;beliefs.  (I was raised in a very fundamental Bible-thumping
&gt;way as is typical in the southern states.)  And in a few minutes
&gt;of dialog you made it all so clear. 

Thank you.

The first meeting is July 17th, 2005.
