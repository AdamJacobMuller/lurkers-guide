<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: about DofS and Phoenix Rising (very very mild spoiler)</H2>
22 May 1998<PRE>&gt;I just saw the reairing of DofS and ive got a question: did you already
&gt;shoot "phoenix rising" when you put together DofS or did you use the footage
&gt;of the Garibaldi hostage scene from DofS in "Phoenix Rising". 

The latter.

&gt;also, i saw the promo for the next ep of season five.  Was Lennier lying
&gt;down in the minbari fighter or is it just the camera angle?

The former.
