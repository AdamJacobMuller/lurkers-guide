<H2>Re: Claudia Confirms She Quit</H2>
18 May 1998<PRE>But see, this is where I lose all respect for this kind of discussion.  Just
about every time we introduce a new character, some folks say he or she is
wooden...then, later, this is a good character and THAT character is wooden.

But then there's that word, which is the core of it for me.  These days,
over-acting is taken as acting...acting which has any kind of subtlety or
reality is termed "wooden" when it's simply not chewing up all the scenery in a
room.

On a strictly technical basis, my personal feeling is that Tracy is a better
performer than Claudia; that's a non-biased appraisal, said in the same way
that I can say that Andreas on a strictly technical basis is a better performer
than Stephen...though I'd rather not use such words as "better," which gets
into subjective appraisals, when some things -- extent of training, skills one
brings to the job -- can be more objectively explored.

Bottom line...Ivanova was a yeller; Lochley is a thinker.  They are two
different characters.  You can't look at Lochley and expect her to be the same
character or act like Ivanova.  That would be an insult to both the character,
the actor and the audience.
