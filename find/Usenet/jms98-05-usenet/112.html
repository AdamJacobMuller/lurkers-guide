22 May 1998<PRE>&gt;Is there some sort of endemic problem with actors' contracts or long-term
&gt;script coordination which makes the unique quality of your show impractical
&gt;to implement in most other shows?  It would be truly sad if this was the
&gt;case.

Nope, it's a philosophical thing, not a business thing.
