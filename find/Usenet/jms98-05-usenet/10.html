10 May 1998<PRE>&gt; To make the experience of viewing TNT programming
&gt;less painful for your fans, have you considered writing some
&gt;storylines for TNT Monday Nitro?  TKO was considered a less-
&gt;successful episode -- could you "redeem" yourself here?

&gt;The wrestler Sting appears to be a Crow knock-off.  Are you open to the
&gt;possibility of professional wrestlers dressing as Narns or Minbari?
&gt;How about the Nitro Fly Girls dressed as Centauri slaves?  I think
&gt;someone wrestling in a Vorlon encounter suit would be interesting.
&gt;
&gt;

So...have the drugs worn off, or are they just kicking in...?
