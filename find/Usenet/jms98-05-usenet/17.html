11 May 1998<PRE>&gt;... and you'd think the new photos of the Cydonia region from the Mars
&gt;Surveyor might lay to rest the stories about the face/city/pyramids that
&gt;sprung up from the Viking photos. 

Difference is this time we have a note from the Cydonia equivilent stating the
unequivocal truth here.  If we sent a camera over Mars and there was a big huge
5 mile long sign saying IT AIN'T A FACE, OKAY, IT'S JUST A DUMP FOR OUR OLD
PEPSI CANS, I think that would go a long ways toward resolving the situation.

&gt;Can you tell us whether we'll find out more about the Fourth Question
&gt;   in the next group of episodes? or do we have to wait until the ones
&gt;   being held back for fall are aired?

It's in the last batch.
