<H2>Re: Attn JMS: Dumb Question Time (S1/S2)</H2>
22 May 1998<PRE>&gt;That being the case (and here's where it gets dumb), was there an
&gt;overwhelming
&gt;reason why the switch was done *right* at the S1/S2 break?  As opposed to,
&gt;say,
&gt;keeping Sinclair on the station for one episode, maybe two, enough to make
&gt;the
&gt;fans think that it all was just a bad rumor -- and *then* yanking Sinclair
&gt;off
&gt;the board, using your patented
&gt;sneak-up-behind-the-viewers-with-a-sockful-of-sand (TM) technique?

Several reasons.  For one, Michael is basically a New Yorker, and wanted to be
back there to pursue some stage opportunities.  We went our separate ways in
May, and filming for S2 didn't start until July/August, so he would've had to
uproot himself twice to do a few eps at the start...also, contracts being what
they are, we had to either renegotiate his contract, or renew it for all 22,
contractual terms don't allow for you to bring on the actor like that for only
a couple if the contract requires 22.  And, finally, it was just cleaner that
way.
