<H2>Claudia Confirms She Quit</H2>
9 May 1998<PRE>To those folks who have been ragging on me when I said that Claudia was the one
who quit the show, that she was NOT fired, and calling into question my honesty
and my forthrightness...I point you toward the Summer issue of Sci Fi Invasion,
containing an interview with Claudia wherein she confirms, point blank, without
equivocation, that she quit the show.  

I would hope these same individuals would now have the spine to apologize, but
I very much doubt it.
