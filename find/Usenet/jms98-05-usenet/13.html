<H2>Re: A message for JMS on usenet</H2>
10 May 1998<PRE>It's a good idea...but River and Sleeping are very different in tone and
attitude, and frankly, putting them together would work to de-emphasize certain
special aspects of both.  And Sleeping, as the culmination of the 5 year story,
really does merit a night of its own.  And as I look at that story, I think
that the Wednesday before Thanksgiving may actually be the perfect time for it.
