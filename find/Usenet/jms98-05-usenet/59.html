<H2>SF Cruise Officially Off</H2>
11 May 1998<PRE>Dear Friends-

Sadly I have to inform you that the decision has been made to call off the
Sci-Fi Sea Cruise for 1998.  So what happened?  The detailed cancellation
announcement appears on the cruise web site (listed below), along with a fan
survey that we hope you will respond to in order to help us decide how best to
go about any rescheduling efforts for the future.

Most sincerely- Dan Harris
