&gt;Um, what happens to Sandy Bruckner? She was working with the Fan Club.

Nothing.  Sandy was never involved with the business operations of the fan club
on a day-to-day managerial level.  Sandy's work for the club continues, in the
same areas as always: cons, thestation.com and Universe Today/Headline News.
