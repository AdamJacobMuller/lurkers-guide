19 May 1998<PRE>
&gt;I think I saw in one of your
&gt;digests that they're may be a widescreen/letterbox version.  Is this
&gt;true?  and if so why would a show designed for television use movie
&gt;screen sizes?
&gt;
&gt;
We've tried to stay ahead of the technology curve where possible.  So all of B5
except for the pilot was filmed widescreen, and cropped for regular current TV
aspect ratios.  Why?  We just think like that.
