<H2>OT:  Words to live by</H2>
14 May 98<PRE>One of my favorite great makers of a century past
had these things to say that give me a reality 
check when I need it.  And I think we need it here.

Oscar Wilde (alledgedly) said:

"The truth is rarely plain and never simple."

"There is no sin except stupidity."

"Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things
are corrupt without being charming.  This is a fault."

"The well-bred contradict other people.  
The wise contradict themselves."

"It is absurd to divide people into good and bad. 
People are either charming or tedious."

"It is only the intellectually lost who
ever argue."

"All art is quite useless."

"We teach people how to remember, 
we never teach them how to grow.

"Life is far too important to be taken seriously."

And, of course:

Custom's Agent:  Do you have anything to declare?
Oscar Wilde:  Only my genious.

Rebo's definitely got a good taste for his 
quotations.
