11 Jun 1997<PRE>There have only been a couple of very rare cases when a director has said
"Why did you do this?"  Usually we explain why -- we were running long, an
EFX shot didn't work out, whatever -- and it's never a problem.  There
have been, I think, about 3 cases when a director said it was really
important to him to do it a certain way in one shot, and if a director
feels that strongly about it, we tend to think we should go along with it.
