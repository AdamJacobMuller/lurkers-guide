<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Directing</H2>
17 Jun 1997<PRE>"Having read through this months edition of Starburst (I think), Claudia
Christian mentions that you enjoyed directing.  My question is a very
simple one:  would you do it again, and what part of the directing the
episode did you find the most enjoyable/rewarding?"

I really don't know if I'd say that I *enjoyed* it...my main concern every
day was somehow getting through it without embarrassing myself, or letting
down the crew or the cast or, ultimately, the viewers.  I wanted the
direction to the the equal to the performances I knew were waiting to be
unlocked.  I haven't commented on it much for the same reason you rarely
see me saying that a given script of mine is good...I'm too close to it
and too critical of everydamnthing I do.  But so far everyone of the crew
who's seen it, and a few others, were very much moved and satisfied by it.

I don't know if I'll do it again or not...my gut says probably not.  If I
*were* to even try it again, it couldn't be anything other than a final
episode of a season, given how much is involved in prep if you're going to
have a chance to get it right.
