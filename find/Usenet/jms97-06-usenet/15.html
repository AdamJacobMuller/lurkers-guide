<H2>Re: ATTN JMS/George - TNT Movies (videotapes?) in the UK</H2>
17 Jun 1997<PRE>Christopher-

&gt; But my question is this: for those of us who--on principle--don't have
&gt; either cable or satellite (just terrestrial TV), are TNT likely to
&gt; release
&gt; the B5 movies on videotape at some point here in the UK, given the market
&gt; success that the WB tapes of the B5 series have been over here?
&gt; 

Nothing has been decided yet, but success breeds success, doesn't it?
