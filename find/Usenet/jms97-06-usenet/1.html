30 May 1997<PRE>"were these White Stars tired or something? I would've expected that a
couple of them could just go slice-slice, sever the rotating sections on
the EA ships and have 'em for breakfast."

Sure, if all you're interested in is slaughtering the opposition...they
were designed for "destroy"...when you have to pull your punches to avoid
just going in and killing EVERYthing in sight...which will only work
*against* you in the long run, it becomes more difficult.
