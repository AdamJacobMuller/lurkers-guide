<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Writer's Block</H2>
11 Jun 1997<PRE>This is probably going to honk off a lot of other writers, but...I've
never had writer's block.  Never.  Not ever.  Not in the 26 years since I
started writing seriously at age 17.  My problem has only been in getting
it all *down*, there's so much to work from.  If I dried up right now on
stories, what I have in notes alone could probably carry me through the
next 10 years.
