26 Apr 1998<PRE>I basically slid the thing forward about 4 episodes or thereabouts; the
resolution as shown was always the planned resolution.

Interestingly, there have been a number of reviews of the B5 videotapes running
in the British SF magazines, and several of them have mentioned how Into the
Fire actually played much better seen all as a piece with the preceding and
following episodes than they thought it did the first time, which is what I
kinda figured would be the case.
