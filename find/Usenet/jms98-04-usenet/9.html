<H2>Re: Better Things Come in Small Packages</H2>
6 Apr 1998<PRE>Significantly, while the Pasadena con was asking $50 for autographs, over half
the B5 cast was at the Glendale Galleria today and yesterday (and me with them)
meeting the fans face to face and signing autographs and getting to see props
and other stuff...for free.
