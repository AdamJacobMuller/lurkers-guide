<H2>Re: Attn JMS: Shadows and Hegel?</H2>
28 Apr 1998<PRE>This has come up before...and yes, there is a certain amount of Hegelian
thinking in the approach of the Shadows philosophy, that conflict is a
requirement for progress.

It's also couched somewhat in Jungian terms of the Shadow, which seemed as good
a place as any to hide the necessity of conflict.
