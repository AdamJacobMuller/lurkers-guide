13 Apr 1998<PRE>We have, from the beginning, been shooting in widescreen and doing a complex
audio mix and delivering conformed negatives for the purpose of working in the
HDTV mode.  We plan to do more in terms of digital delivery and 5-1 audio sound
for Crusade, among some other tricks we're planning.
