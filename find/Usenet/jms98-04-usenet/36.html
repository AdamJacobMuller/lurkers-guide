<H2>Re: Attn: JMS - Credit Question</H2>
24 Apr 1998<PRE>&gt;I am curious as to why Walter Koenig (who as far as I
&gt;can tell has appeared in more S5 eps than either Mumy or Furst) is left out
&gt;of
&gt;the canned opening credit sequence. Is this due to contractual
&gt;considerations?
&gt;Stylistic reasons (i.e. a no "bad" guys policy)?

No, you put someone in the main titles when you make an overall deal, usually 8
episodes or more, with an actor in advance of the season.  With Walter, we
average about 4 eps per season, and they are each negotiated individually, as
they come up.

&gt;I have one acquaintance - a S.T.
&gt;fanatic -
&gt;who solely justifies his condemnation of B5 as a S.T. clone by Koenig's
&gt;presence.... Kinda makes you wanna clean the gene pool, but there you have
&gt;it...)

So in other words, your friend thinks that an actor who is in one successful
show should never work in the TV business, ever again, on any other show,
whether he's a good actor or not.

Your friend is a yutz.
