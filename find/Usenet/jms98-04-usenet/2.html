<H2>Re: ATTN: JMS.  Comments on Phoenix Rising&lt;spoilers&gt;</H2>
1 Apr 1998<PRE>&gt;Thank you for creating this beauty, and if any more new
&gt;episodes have this kind of feel to them, I feel like i'm going to have
&gt;to send you a medical bill, for I will surely end up in the hospital.

Then you'd better up your insurance, real soon.

I'll just say this: we were lucky to get one "Coming of Shadows" episode a
year, a while back.  In the latter half of this season, especially from about
516-520 or thereabouts, we have one just about eveyr week.

I gave folks a respite for the first part, because in the second part of this
season, I'm going to hurt you.  There will be some light at the end, because I
wouldn't end this otherwise, but in the interim, it's gonna be pretty damned
intense.
