<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: "The Ragged Edge" and Season 5 Comments</H2>
13 Apr 1998<PRE>Thanks...after our last stand-alone this coming week, they're all on a par with
"Edge" or better, frankly.  

As for the virtual sets stuff...yeah, some of the early Mars stuff was iffy, I
agree.  That's part of the experimentation process, you never hit it dead-on
the first time.  We learned each time we did something like that, and continued
to experiment until we could more carefully and completely integrate the CGI
virtual sets with the live action, and we're continuing to get more ambitious
about it.
