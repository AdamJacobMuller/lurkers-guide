3 Apr 1998<PRE>There are many other good writers out there who I have every confidence can do
a good job on Crusade.  And bear in mind that any script that comes in
generally gets revised by me, so I'll be in there.  The plan for now is that
I'll do about 11 scripts out of 22, and have freelancers doing the other half.
