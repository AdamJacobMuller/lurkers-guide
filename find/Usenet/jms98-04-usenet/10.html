<H2>Crusade Confirmed</H2>
6 Apr 1998<PRE>As has come out in the press today, CRUSADE: The Babylon Project, is officially
a go project as a series.  We start shooting July 27th to go on the air January
6th.  More info will follow over time.

Also, for those of a collecting nature...tomorrow will see the publication of
the Babylon 5 issue of the Hollywood Reporter, a tribute to the show and some
of the new production techniques we've pioneered.  You can try various news
stands or libraries as a main source for this one.
