&gt;In this episode, a telepath named Harris develops Multiple Personality
&gt;Disorder, kills his room mate, and flees to Babylon 5.  He leaves behind
&gt;several documents.  One of them was dated with the year 2264.  The current
&gt;year is only 2262.  Why the calender error?

One of his personalities was a Time Lord.
