29 Apr 1998<PRE>Why not?  

I have some pictures of me in B&amp;W as well as color, mainly because in many
cases B&amp;W *looks* better under various lighting conditions.  Go to any good
sized display of art photos, and you'll see that the *majority* of them are
B&amp;W.  

There seems to be this notion that the future means throwing away anything that
isn't at the edge...and it ain't true.
