<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Writing staff</H2>
26 Apr 1998<PRE>&gt;However, you have stated that you plan to write about half of the episodes
&gt;yourself, and give the other half to freelancers.  Won't using freelancers 
&gt;be difficult, as each writer will have to be taught about your universe?

Yep, though having a series bible will help.

&gt;And won't it mean more work for you, having to make sure each script is
&gt;true to the Crusade characters and universe?

Yep again...having freelancers is actually more difficult even than doing them
myself, but frankly, the only way to find writers who you *can* eventually
bring on staff is to make freelance assignments and see who can hear the music
and who can't.
