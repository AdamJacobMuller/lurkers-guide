<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Your "typical" day?</H2>
15 Apr 1998<PRE>&gt;Howdy, I was just wondering what you'r typical day was/is like. I've heard
&gt;rumors about how much you write, but I've never hear that you actually "eat"
&gt;or
&gt;"sleep". 

Too much of the former, not enough of the latter.

&gt;How much time did you spend on the B5 set while they were filming?

It varies.  In the beginning of the series, I spent a lot of time on the stage,
because we were setting the style and look of the show, and directors were
still trying to figure out what I wanted, and how to deliver what I wanted. 
Over the last couple of years, though, that's decreased...in part because the
directors and the cast all know what's expected, and it's become a well-oiled
machine.  It's also in part due to the increase of my responsibility on the
writing/producing side...by the time I take care of what needs doing, the day's
nearly over and I haven't even made it out to the set once (which kinda bums me
out when it happens).

&gt;   How much time do you spend answering these on-line questions?

I'm on line generally 2-3 hours a day.

&gt;   How much time do you get to sleep?

On weekdays, during production, average about 3-4 hours a night.  I'm at the
stage in the morning, lunch is usually about 1, I'm there until about
6:30-7:00, I get a bite to eat on the way home in most cases, I get behind the
keyboard at about 8-8:30, and I'm there until I crash about 4:30 a.m., and then
I crash.  On weekends I try to make up for the lost sleep as best I can.

&gt;   How much time does it take to write or "fix" a script?

Writing a script is invariably faster than fixing an outside script.  I can
write a script from zero in an average of 5-7 days.  On a few rare occasions
it's gone longer, but when that happens, I find I lose the white-heat of the
story, and it wanders a bit.  In a few cases I've written a script in a day or
two (A View from the Gallery all came out of my keyboard in one day, between
about 4 p.m. and 3 a.m.)

&gt;   How much time do you spend at home or at "work".

It's all work.  Just the office differs.

&gt;Just typical everyday things.
