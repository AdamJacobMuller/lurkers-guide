26 Apr 1998<PRE>&gt;It was pointed out in the Scriptwriting book that any script sent to a
&gt;studio and rejected is basically a black hole forever; it can't be
&gt;resubmitted there. But what about the writer? Is the writer shunned, or
&gt;just the script?
&gt;
&gt;
Depends on how bad the script was.
