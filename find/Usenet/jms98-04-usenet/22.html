<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Why We're Bored</H2>
13 Apr 1998<PRE>There is an interesting story told about the first time that Gaugain (I know I
probably misspelled that, I should know how to spell it but it's late and my
art books aren't at hand) went to visit Van Gogh.  Van Gogh, anticipating his
arrival, had filled the halls with his latest work, to display it for the
master.  Because they fell into certain categories where he came to expect
certain things, he did not notice the intricacies of what was going on in the
composition.

His guest walked down the hall, considering the work -- sunflowers, landscapes
-- and at the end of the tour, announced, "You paint too fast."

"No," Van Gogh said, "you LOOK too fast."
