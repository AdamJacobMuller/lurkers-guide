<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: A Defining Moment</H2>
7 Apr 1998<PRE>&gt;What is the defining moment of Babylon 5 to you? The one moment when it all
&gt;comes together?

If this is concerning individual episodes...it's in the editing and the audio
mix stages, that's when it actually becomes an episode.

For the series overall...I don't know how to answer that.
