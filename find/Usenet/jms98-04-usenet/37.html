<H2>Re: Attn jms: Season 5 Opening</H2>
26 Apr 1998<PRE>&gt;I prefered the original Season 5 opening.  The newer one uses new voice
&gt;overs that are so...bland.  At least the original opening had sound bytes
&gt;directly from older episodes and they had life/emotion in them.

The problem, however, is that since they came from the original production
track, they had a great deal of background noise on them, and in many cases
weren't satisfactory to be heard clearly by most people.  We could put them
back, but then many people wouldn't be able to understand them well, which
kinda defeats the point.

&gt;Also, there's always a greenish streak that flashes from left to right at
&gt;the end of the opening credits.  

Those are colored streamers/trailers being made by a pair of Starfuries.
