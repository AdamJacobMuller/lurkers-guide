<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: "River of Souls" Casting</H2>
20 Apr 1998<PRE>&gt;I was wondering what prompted your casting of Ian McShane.  I loved
&gt;him in his comedic role in "Lovejoy."  But, are you planning to cast him
&gt;in a somewhat comedic role, or is it a more dramatic one?
&gt;
&gt;
He's a fine actor; in fact, John is a major Lovejoy fan, so he was hot to get
Ian on board.

&gt;And, hey, Martin Sheen.  Joe, you are moving up in the world.  Did you
&gt;ever think when this B5 started you'd be writing for Martin Sheen?

No, and I'm very pleased.  I'm a huge fan of his work and have been forever.  I
was knocked out when we got him...he considers it one of the best parts he's
had lately on a creative level, and he's been a kick to work with.
