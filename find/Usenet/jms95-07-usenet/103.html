<H2>JMS: does Sheridan have a thou</H2>
16 Jul 1995<PRE>     Joseph Campbell is good if you're looking to analyze something AFTER
the fact; to do so before the fact, or while you're creating, makes the
result too by-the-numbers.  You have to try NOT to become too aware of the
myth-process in fiction, or you become like the centipede asked which leg
goes first.
