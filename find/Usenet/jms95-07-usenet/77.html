<H2>Attn JMS - writing CGI ?</H2>
15 Jul 1995<PRE>     Nothing can be storyboarded until it's written in the script first;
so usually it's something like
 
EXT. NARN HOMEWORLD (CGI)
 
A giant space aardvark emerges from a jump-point, snarling and spitting.
 
      There's only been one case where all I wrote was, "They fight.  Ron,
go nuts."  Other than that, it's always scripted shot-for-shot, often as:
 
ANGLE - SHERIDAN'S STARFURY
 
As it blows TOWARD CAMERA, and we
 
REVERSE - HIS POV
 
The giant space aardvark turns, prepares to fight.
 
                                                                    jms
