<H2>Chicago ComiCon Report (!SPOIL</H2>
11 Jul 1995<PRE>     BTW, Mark, as promised, we amalgamed your name and Julie's into one
name (Julie Musante), and that has now been used as a major character in
"Voices of Authority," as per the auction.  It's a big role, and a very
memorable character who has some...intriguing scenes with Sheridan.
