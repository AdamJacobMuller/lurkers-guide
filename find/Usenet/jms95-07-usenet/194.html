<H2>How do I submit story ideas?</H2>
28 Jul 1995<PRE>     We *have* our story ideas for the show.  Five years worth.  Bear in
mind that Star Trek is the exception to the rule of how TV series work;
no other show accepts story ideas from folks out there.
 
     (I'm speaking specifically of non-established writers.  Spec scripts
can sometimes get through on shows, but nobody else really looks for just
story ideas.  On B5, all but 2 freelance scripts have been based on
story ideas I've assigned out.)
