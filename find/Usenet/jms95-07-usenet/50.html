<H2>ATTN JMS: Chicago CC?</H2>
12 Jul 1995<PRE>     I *greatly* enjoyed the Chicago ComicCon.  Lots of fun, many good
people, a hard-working staff dedicated to making sure things go well, a
terrific operation.  This was only my second year there; I went for the
first time a year ago, dragged along by Harlan.  Glad I went.
 
     High-points for this convention...helping pile on a shoplifter (me
and another guy, the one who ran the booth in the dealer's room) trying
to escape, the two of us holding this guy, struggling to get away, for
the cops, and a con organizer saying to him, "Hey, you've just been
arrested by a celebrity," and the shoplifter's response, "Fuck you"....
the B5 reception, even *with* the MST3Kification of one of my episodes...
the pleasant, friendly, enthusiastic fans who were a joy to meet...it was
an unvarnished terrificness.
