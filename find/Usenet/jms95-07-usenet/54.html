13 Jul 1995<PRE>     Re: the SPACE cgi being blurry...I'm kinda surprised.  I'd seen the
demo reel at Chicago ComicCon, and saw that it was blurry there, even hard
to focus on, but figured it was a low-res test they used in the earlyl
promotion reel.  I was sure they'd go to something a bit more high-res for
the real thing.  I'm astonished.
