19 Jul 1995<PRE>     No, there was never a one-to-one correspondence between Sinclair and
Sheridan.  Catherine Sakai would never have developed the shadow link.
Bear in mind, if it's a straight transposition from A to B, then there's
no NEED for B.  The whole idea was to bring in someone who could be put
into situations Sinclair couldn't without straining credulity.
