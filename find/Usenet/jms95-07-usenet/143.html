<H2>ATTN: BABYLON 5 EMMY NOMINATIO</H2>
21 Jul 1995<PRE>     Which reminds me...I wanted to note that just about everyone
involved with B5 is *ecstatic* over X-File's nomination as best series.
It's a terrific show, and deserves the nod.  It's also maybe only the
second or so time a genre/nominally SF show has gotten that nomination,
and that bodes nothing but good for the SF-TV business.
