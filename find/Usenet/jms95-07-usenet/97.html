<H2>Re: Attn JMS - writing CGI ?</H2>
16 Jul 1995<PRE>     That was kinda the problem; Sinclair didn't really *have* a direct
or personal connection to the Shadows.  I figured it'd be too much to do
that on top of his direct, personal connection to so much else of the B5
storyline.  I figured he'd get into it by virtue of his involvement with
so many others touched by it; problem is, very soon that turns you into
an expositional sounding-board or a problem-solver, with the other person
at the core of the story.  It's one of those things you don't really see
until you're well into the writing of the story, as with any novel.
