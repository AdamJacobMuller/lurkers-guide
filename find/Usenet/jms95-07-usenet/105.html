<H2>Attn. JMS: Planning B5 Music</H2>
16 Jul 1995<PRE>     We have an Audio Spotting Session.  At this, I sit down with John
Copeland, Chris Franke, George Johnsen, and screen the newly-finished
episode (it's been edited and on-lined).  I call out the time-code for
the beginning and endings of sections where I want music.  E.g, "Okay,
in at 03:23:15 (three minutes, 23 seconds, 15 frames), out at 04:15:23."
Sometimes I will have specific ideas on the kind of music ("I think we
need to go soft here, mainly strings, some brass, but *light*"), other
times I just leave it to Chris to get what the sense of the scene is.  If
there is a big EFX sequence going on at the same time, as in a battle
scene, the sound design people (also in the meeting) and I go over the
scene with Chris, and decide which elements will be carried by sound, and
which by music, making sure each carves out sufficient space in either the
high-end or the low-end to accommodate the other.
