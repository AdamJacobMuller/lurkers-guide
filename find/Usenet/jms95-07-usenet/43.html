<H2>Att JMS: No sidestepping now,</H2>
11 Jul 1995<PRE>     Yes, Harlan returns next season as our consultant.  And believe me,
he's been VERY busy, mainly with his comic from Dark Horse, DREAM
CORDIDOR.  He's written new stories for every issue, plus all the
interstitial pages, in addition to his work with me on B5, plus several
other new stories, a script for a new Showtime anthology that's a
knockout which has a bunch of big-name directors fighting over it.
