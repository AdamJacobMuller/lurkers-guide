<H2>ATTN JMS: Us nitpicking netter</H2>
4 Jul 1995<PRE>     I'm not entirely sure I understand the question.  Some "nitpicks" have
contained valid points; some haven't.  Some have been based on incorrect
perceptions that are easily corrected.  Some are factual.  I
am not entirely sure what you mean by "not taken into account."
