<H2>ATTN JMS: Episode title questi</H2>
23 Jul 1995<PRE>     "The Geometry of Shadows" seemed to me a good metaphor for the
technomages; a mix of science with something dark and mysterious.  How do
you work out the geometry of something that in one sense doesn't really
exist, but is a projection of something else that DOES exist?  That
seemed to me as good a notion of technomagic as anything else.
