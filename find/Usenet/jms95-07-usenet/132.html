<H2>ATTN JMS: Questions from book</H2>
19 Jul 1995<PRE>      The starfuries drop for the same reason a bucket flies away from
you when you're swinging it and let go; the rotation causes the pressure
of gravity, which pushes the fighters out the bays.  Very simple, and
factually based.
 
     The scan of Ivanova in the book was a bit more than I'd wanted, but
that one bit slipped by me.
