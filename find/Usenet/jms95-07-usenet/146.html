<H2>Adventures of Petey and Joey a</H2>
21 Jul 1995<PRE>     I was kind of aghast when I saw that Peter had printed what happened
in the dealer's room at ComicCon, when I helped tackle and bring down a
shoplifter, holding him for the cops for about ten minutes while he was
hoping to get away.  I found out about it when I went into my local comics
store and the owner came over and said he felt a lot safer seeing me
there...and I wondered what the hell he was saying, he was obviously
kidding on the square...then I found out.  Ah, well....
