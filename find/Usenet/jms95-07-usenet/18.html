<H2>JMS: Casino Painting?</H2>
7 Jul 1995<PRE>     It's a progress mural, starting with early civilization, the pyramids
and stuff in the lower right corner, through the development of agrarian
cultures, technology, cars, planes, jets, all moving left to right on the
canvas, through space flight and finally, in the upper-right corner, B5.
