<H2>Re: Why is Ford in rastb5?</H2>
26 Jul 1995<PRE>     Well, I see that the individual who goes by the handle Rev.
Commander Wayne has come into the fray, fresh from fabricating nonsense
on AOL.  For those not aware, they're quite a clique these three: Wayne,
Ford, and a fellow named Randy Hall.  Those of you with AOL access should
go check out their screeds in the Anti-B5 topic on the ST Neutral Zone
board, and in the ST vs. B5 area in the TV section.  Basically, you've
got 3 people who write dozens and dozens of messages to each other, in
open forum, as though by doing so they create a sense of there being
others of similar inclination.
 
     Another one for those with killfiles.  Anyone with the *least*
suspicion that maybe they have something open-minded to say about
anything, check out the areas noted above.  They're trolls pure and
simple, folks.  We just wasted a lot of time with them over on AOL,
believe me.
 
                                                                  jms
