<H2>JMS: "Pitching a Winner"</H2>
30 Jul 1995<PRE>     The short story I'd done in high school -- god, do you *really* want
to know this? -- was a comic story about the Lady of the Lake popping up
again in the present to offer Prince Charles Excalibur...and him not quite
knowing what to do about it, then security was called and...well, it got
quite interesting, particularly since she'd popped up in his bathtub.
