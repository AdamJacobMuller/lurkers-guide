<H2>Looking for Captain Power</H2>
12 Jul 1995<PRE>     Yeah, the Siskel and Ebert thing was great.  For those who didn't
hear about this...we worked *very* hard to make Captain Power nominally a
show for grownups, screw the toys.  And we got hammered in the press,
mainly by people who hadn't watched the show.  So one day, I'm watching
SisBert doing their collective thing, a video round-up installment of
their review show...and suddenly they say, look, we don't normally talk
about TV series, but there's this one show you gotta check out, it's got
a dopey name, and forget the toys, but there's something Going On with
this show, it's really got a great story.
 
     It was, alas, too little too late for CP.
