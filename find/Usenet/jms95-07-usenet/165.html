<H2>Even Quicker Notes from jms</H2>
24 Jul 1995<PRE>     Last reminder: next Saturday is San Diego Comic Con, 11 a.m. to 1 p.m.
and if you're in the area, you may want to drop by for the B5 presentation
scheduled for that time.
 
     A company is in the process of licensing a slick, full-color B5
magazine; looks pretty good.  More as this develops.
 
     For those into this sort of thing...the literary SF review,
FOUNDATION, published out of England, is doing a whole issue on media SF,
with particular attention to B5.  I've turned in what they say will be the
ceterpiece of the issue, a 28 page, 7600 word article titled "Approaching
Babylon."  Although it contains a few things mentioned on the nets, about
90% of is it new stuff, background info, personal observations and the
like.
 
     Finally, one week from tomorrow, we start filming on year three, with
episode #301, "Matters of Honor," which also introduces a new recurring
character named Marcus.
 
                                                                    jms
