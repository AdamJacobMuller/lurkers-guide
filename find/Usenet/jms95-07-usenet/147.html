<H2>ATTN JMS -- Comic #8 Design yo</H2>
21 Jul 1995<PRE>     I didn't get too much into that one shot in the comic; it seemed
reasonable under the circumstances.  The one panel where I *did* get
screwed was saying, "Hey, look, this here episode's going to air just
before the book comes out, so why don't we REALLY tie the book and the
show together by inserting this one panel I came up with here...."
 
     Sometimes I outsmart myself.....
