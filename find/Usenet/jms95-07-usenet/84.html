<H2>JMS: The Process of Card Makin</H2>
15 Jul 1995<PRE>      Re: the Fleer process...I approve the selection of photos, and the
text, and will approve the final look of the cards as well.
 
      The process has been wondefully painless, Fleer has been nothing
but helpful and cooperative.  Not much has been omitted.  And as for
why do them: I figured they'd be cool...and I think they will be.
