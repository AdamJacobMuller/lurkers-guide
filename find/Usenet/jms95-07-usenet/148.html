<H2>ATTN JMS:  Full or part time o</H2>
21 Jul 1995<PRE>     It really depends on the breaks.  Sometimes a regular cast member
can be there every day; sometimes they get a day or two off here and there
within the course of an episode.
 
     Guest actors are booked by days needed, or if it's a major part, then
a full-week deal is made.
 
     What most folks probably don't know is that when you shoot an episode
you first begin by doing a production board, and what scenes are shot in
which order is determined by *where the scenes take place.*
 
     For instance: we have 3 stages.  So in the morning, we'll shoot all
the scenes that take place in medlab.  If that takes all day, then that's
how long we're there.  Once we finish, if it's say around lunchtime, we'll
generally try and stay in the same stage to minimize the hassles of going
from stage A to C, because then you've got to re-rig and set up and that
kills time.  Sometimes you'll change stages if you've got Actor B only for
3 days under contract, and you have to adjust.
 
     We take it as a matter of pride that in 44 episodes, we've had only
about 8 days of overtime on a shoot, and never once have we done a forced
call on an actor.
 
                                                                     jms
