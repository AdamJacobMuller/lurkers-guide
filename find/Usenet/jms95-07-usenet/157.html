<H2>ATTN: JMS Questions on Ghostbu</H2>
22 Jul 1995<PRE>     "Ulysses" is probably the most moving of Tennyson's work, for my
money.  It speaks to something profoundly entrenched in the human
spirit.  It's something I try to put in front of people at any
opportunity.
 
     As for Janine...the change bothered the hell out of me, to go from
a strong, smart, fashion-aware (in a weird way), independent woman...to
a mommy-character.  And, in time, they kinda realized that I was right,
and the consultants were wrong...mainly when the mailbags filled with
angry letters from mothers and young girls raising ten kinds of hell.
 
     But by then they didn't have any solution except just change her
without explanation *again*...which is when I chimed in and said, "I
can fix this.  But you've got to let me do this MY way."  They did, and
it was done.
 
     I was somewhat disappointed by Ghostbusters II.  It took an awful
long time to get going, and then just fell back on much of what it had
done in the first movie.  It made the producers nuts when they got
audience responses from lots of people saying that they like the TV
series better than the movie, and that the movie was "just for kids."
 
     One of my favorite moments from that was writing an episode called
"Take Two," in which Hollywood producers come to the guys and say they
want to make a movie about the team...so they go to LA, have a little
adventure...and the episode ends with actual footage from the first
movie...with the result that millions of kids were convinced, totally
conVINced, that the series *preceded* the first movie.
 
     It was one of the more wonderfully sick things I've done.
