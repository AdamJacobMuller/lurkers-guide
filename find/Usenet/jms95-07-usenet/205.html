<H2>ATTN JMS: X-Files et al</H2>
31 Jul 1995<PRE>     Actually, my guess is that X-Files does have a larger budget than we
do, since they do a LOT of location filming, which is very expensive (als0
David Duchovney just got a bump in salary to $100,000 an episode).  And
yes, one may discuss "Twilight" with those across the pond who've seen it
here.
