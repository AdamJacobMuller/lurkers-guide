<H2>Clearing the air.</H2>
26 Jul 1995<PRE>     Good heavens, I was virtually unaware of the degree to which this
had escalated.  To add, quietly, my two-cents...when I found one of my
posts had been edited by Jay for spoilers, I inquired of him privately
and indicated that this might not be A Good Thing, since I'd been fairly
careful in my phraseology.  He accepted that, and apologized, and was
quite gracious about it.
 
     For my money, you can't keep spoilers out of here, protected or
unprotected, except by virtue of shared kindness and understanding.  The
whole REASON for my getting a moderated newsfeed, as I now do, was to
PREVENT the need to moderate the newsgroup for content.  It thus seems
to me slightly unproductive that it's now done for spoilers when we took
this step of moderating my feed, and inconveniencing many of the rastB5
Rangers, to avoid moderation.
