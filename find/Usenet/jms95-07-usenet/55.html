<H2>Re: B5 Novels....</H2>
13 Jul 1995<PRE>     Of course it's a pain in the ass.  It's a PROFOUND pain in the ass to
keep track of all this.  But it's kinda in the job description.  As far as
the novels go, an outline comes in, on spec, and I work with it to make it
fit in continuity, or at least not contradict anything being done in the
series.  Sometimes that means major changes, sometimes it's minor stuff,
but something always needs to be done.  And done again, as much as can be,
when the actual manuscript comes in.  It's one more thing, but then my
life is generally "one more thing."
