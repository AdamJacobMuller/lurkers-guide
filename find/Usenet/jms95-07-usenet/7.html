<H2>Re: Dave Shao's post bites</H2>
4 Jul 1995<PRE>     In my orignal reply to Davaid Shao, I specifically asked that people
NOT pile on him because of this.  It's resolved.  I'm now on a moderated
newsfeed, and all is well.  No story ideas can now reach me from this
service.  Over, done, forgotten.
