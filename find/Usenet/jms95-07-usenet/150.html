<H2>JMS, JV, et al.: Writing</H2>
21 Jul 1995<PRE>     The two keys in creating characters for TV are: allies and enemies,
you create people who you know will come into conflict with one another,
because conflict is a huge part of drama, not the whole of it, but a
necessary ingredient.  So you also build some who can be sympathetic, or
funny by turns, but you don't want to minimize or throw away a character,
you add a layer of depth to it to give meat to the humor when used.
 
      It's kind of like planning a military campaign, really.
 
     The world and the characters of B5 kind of came together at the
same time, one feeding off another until they took on a life of their
own.  And building both was a joy.
