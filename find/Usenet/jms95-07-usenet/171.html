24 Jul 1995<PRE>     Eventually we may sell scripts of the show; we'll see.
 
     Re: fourth acts...they're difficult to pull off on the best of days,
because you've got to pull together a lot of stuff in a very short amount
of time, and make everything make sense.  And sometimes, in the last season
or thereabouts, I kinda got the feeling that some of the X-Files eps I saw
somewhat fell apart in the fourth act, where it didn't come together, or
things happened too conveniently, or what it WAS was less interesting than
it was SUPPOSED to be.  It happens.
