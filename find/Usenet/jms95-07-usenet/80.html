15 Jul 1995<PRE>     Yes, the events as described in the article you describe (it was in
"Penthouse") are correct, and happened as written.  (I should know, I
wrote it.)
 
     When I sent the article in to Penthouse (knowing full it would
forever firebomb any chance of ever working in animation again), they asked
why on *earth* I sent an article on kid's TV to *PENTHOUSE* for
chrissakes.
 
     "Because I want the creeps at Broadcast Standards and Practices,
who turn white at the slightest hint of anything improper, to have to
flip through Penthouse to get to the article about them."  The woman at
the other end of the phone just about croaked laughing.
