<H2>ATTN: jms non-B5 Ques</H2>
28 Jul 1995<PRE>     My scriptwriting book is not currently in print, though a) it's
still available in many libraries, and b) I hope to have the new edition
turned in shortly.  Yes, it deals with the agent/writer relationship.
And currently we're not looking at specs for B5 due to the fact that the
stories are all pretty much worked out.
