7 Jul 1995<PRE>     I'd love to get more information on this; heck, we can use it for PR
if nothing else.  I'd particularly love to know what specifically they
like about/watch for in the show.
 
     (In thinking about this, there's some stuff in the second or so
episode of year three that they're absolutely gonna *love*.  All I can say
is that I hope I get a product placement notation from the Vatican.  BTW,
there were real nuns in the line in "Parliament of Dreams.")
