<H2>B5 Novels....</H2>
12 Jul 1995<PRE>     The third B5 book from Dell is due out sometime in the next 4-6
weeks.
 
     Dell has licensed another 5 novels, and is currently considering
proposals/outlines *from established SF pros* (with several novels
published, preferably not just media tie-ins) for these books.
