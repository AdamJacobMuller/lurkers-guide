<H2>TV guide B5 art.out</H2>
18 Jul 1995<PRE>     Here's how my karma works, though...we *finally* get a good article
on B5 in TV Guide.  That kind of press has a brief, week-long effect on
raising ratings in many cases.  So I learn that in quite a few markets,
including LA, B5 is pre-empted next week, so it's a wash.
 
     I must've *really* pissed somebody off in a prior life.
