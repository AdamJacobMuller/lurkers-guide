<H2>Big Bang Refunds (aka CMC meet</H2>
12 Jul 1995<PRE>     To hear that the two numbers for Big Bang/CMC are alternately
disconnected or no longer answering is most disconcerting.  I can't recall
hearing of anyone getting refunds that weren't put through quite some
time ago.
 
     I strongly urge all people who have not yet received refunds from
these people to get together and jointly consider what actions you might
take, particularly in terms of the VIP tickets.  Because with current
reports, plus the non-payment of Michael O'Hare's $5,000, I have grave
concerns about anyone getting their money out of this.
