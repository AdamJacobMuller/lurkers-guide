<H2>ATTN JMS: Selling your soul to</H2>
13 Jul 1995<PRE>     That's a very hard question to answer, if I'm going to try and answer
it totally honestly.  Sitting here now, at this moment, with year 3 a go,
I'd say, "If they said replace Ivanova and Sheridan, I'd refuse, even if
it were a condition of pickup."  That's what I'd like to think I'd say.  I
hope that it's what I *would* say.  At least, at this moment.
 
     But now I try to put myself in that future frame of mind...I have 200
or so people who work for me, who'd be out of jobs.  The story would be
aborted, and the series ultimately a failure because it didn't go to term.
Everything we'd built so carefully these last 2-3 years would be down the
toilet.  We'd have to dismantle the sets, sell old props, vacate the
stage...emotionally, it would be devastating.  Many careers would be hurt.
 
     At that point, it would come down to, Do I hurt 2 people or 200?
 
     So I guess, really, the answer is...I don't know.  I know what I'd
like to do, particularly if I felt strongly that I could get them to back
down.  It's a question of who blinks first.  Fortunately, WB and PTEN are
VERY happy with our cast, feel they're doing great jobs, and we're on the
cusp of breaking through, so I gravely doubt that decision would ever have
to be made.
 
                                                                  jms
