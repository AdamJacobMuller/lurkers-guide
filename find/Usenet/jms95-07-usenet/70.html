<H2>Re: Looking for Captain Power</H2>
14 Jul 1995<PRE>     Yeah, I walked off the show when they a) decided to emphasize Slimer,
and b) make Janine a "mommie" character rather than the hard-as-nails,
sharp, sarcastic person she'd always been.  It wasn't a show I wanted to
do anymore.
 
     I've actually walked off a *lot* of shows in my time, something I only
really realized lately.  Walked of The Real Ghostbusters when they softened
it down and knocked all the corners off; walked off Captain Power when the
toy company got too much control over the stories; zipped off Jake and the
Fatman when my exec producers got screwed over (if they went, I went);
finally left Murder, She Wrote to do B5.  All but the last were over story
control/story integrity.  My agent is frequently driven to distraction over
this.  Money doesn't work to hold me.  If it ain't right, it ain't right.
 
                                                                   jms
