<H2>JMS: imposed tv sf format?</H2>
28 Jul 1995<PRE>     Most TV shows in the 60s were one-story episodes.  The medium became
a bit more complex as time went on, and people wanted to learn more about
the characters and the world.  We've done some episodes that didn't have
a B or C story at all; it's whatever the story requires.
