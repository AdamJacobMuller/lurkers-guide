<H2>Attn JMS:Online presence?</H2>
16 Jul 1995<PRE>     I think the coming B5 web page will have links with other pre-existing
web pages, though there will probably have to be understandings and
the like made before any such site can be even nominally "endorsed" by the
link.  Like a minimum of non-authorized uploaded material (in terms of
avi files and the like).
