<H2>ATTN JMS: More to the music???</H2>
17 Jul 1995<PRE>     I work very closely with Chris Franke.  As for themes, most of hte
(the) major characters have their own themes, and there's a B5 theme
which often gets interpolated in various ways, sometimes in minor chords
(as in "Signs and Portents"), here and there.
