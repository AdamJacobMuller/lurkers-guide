<H2>JMS: Do you read the novel or</H2>
7 Jul 1995<PRE>     I read both.  The Ivanova/Talia thing wasn't handled exactly as I
had thought it would, and missed some parts of it (it was very late that
night), and by the time I caught some of it, it was too late.  The comics
version shows creatures that are not the shadows themselves but some of
the many creatures who serve them.  I try to catch all I can.  I sent the
third book back for a *total* rewrite which put it behind a couple of
months, but that's okay by me.  Better right than on time.
