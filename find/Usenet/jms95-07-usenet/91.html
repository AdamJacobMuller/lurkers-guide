15 Jul 1995<PRE>     We've certainly had a substantial number of older actors and
characters on the show, from June Lockhart to Turhan Bey and Michael
Ansara and many others.  My sense is that with advances in medicine,
you can be active a LOT longer than is currently considered to be the
case, so it isn't much of an issue in B5.
