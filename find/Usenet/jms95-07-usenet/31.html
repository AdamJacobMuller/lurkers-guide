<H2>ATTN JMS : Has the Great War a</H2>
9 Jul 1995<PRE>     Wars generally don't just *begin*, they roll into one another and
grow.  When did WW II begin?  When Germany annexed the Sudetenland?  When
they invaded Poland?  When England got into it?  When Pearl Harbor got
bombed?  Did it in a sense begin with the assassination of Archduke
Ferdinand, which led to WW I, which with a minor pause led into WW II?
