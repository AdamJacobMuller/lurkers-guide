<H2>AAITN Question</H2>
11 Jul 1995<PRE>     The Streib saw an alliance between Earth and Minbar at that moment,
which is the LAST thing they wanted to go up against.  Also, you don't go
to war at the drop of a hat just because somebody sinks or shoots down
one of your ships.  This is one of the cliches in storytelling.  And what
the Streibs were doing was totally unjustifiable in any event.  Do you
gear up for the massive hassle of total war -- supply lines, fleets, all
the rest -- because of this incident?  Remember, the purpose of the ship
was to find races weak enough for them to attack with impunity; they don't
want to go up against a force that can strike back.
