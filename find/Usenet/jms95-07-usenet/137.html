<H2>ATTN JMS: Your dream....</H2>
20 Jul 1995<PRE>     "You seem to accept the concept of dream predictions."
 
     Nope.  Dreams are ways of working out elements of one's day, problem
solving, self-analysis and escape.  I don't believe they can predict much
of anything.  I used it because it was a very striking image, and the
subconscious can come up with stuff that resonates.  And yes, the image
long predates B5.
