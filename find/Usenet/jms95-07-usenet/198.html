<H2>ATTN JMS: Divided Loyalties</H2>
26 Jul 1995<PRE>     Absolutely *nothing* from prior seasons/episodes has been discarded.
So if that's your concern...don't worry about it.
 
     Nothing was trimmed by C4.  There was a slight matching problem in
the footage, that's all.
 
     In very tense situations, some people feel compelled to somehow break
the tension.  Hence, that sequence.
