<H2>ATTN JMS: Dreams (again)</H2>
26 Jul 1995<PRE>     There's a difference between what I believe dreams mean, what the
Centauri believe dreams mean, and what dreams mean to the Centauri, in
that universe, and what they mean to me in our universe.
 
     I suspect the truth lay somewhere between Shroedinger and Jung.
