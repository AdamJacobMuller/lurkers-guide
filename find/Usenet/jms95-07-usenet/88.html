<H2>Re: Looking for Captain Power</H2>
15 Jul 1995<PRE>     I have nothing but good things to say about Angela Lansbury.  She is
probably one of the classiest performers I've worked with, fiercely loyal,
takes responsibility, wonderfully talented...I think she knew that I was
flattered and impressed to be working with her, and I kinda suspect she
thought it was kinda cute, in a dopey kind of way.
 
     Our offices were not far from the shooting stages on the Universal
lot, and most of the time I was stuck behind the keyboard.  But when it
was one of my scripts on the floor, I'd try to get out there once or
twice, just for a few moments.  I'd slip in, watch for a little bit, and
then vanish again...and one day Angela came out and pulled me in, saying
that she was intrigued by the way I'd just materialize and vanish again,
that it was like some magical white horse appearing out of nowhere, and
then vanishing.  She and her husband Peter were both very kind to me.
 
     They even put my novel, OtherSyde, on the bookshelf in the set of
her New York apartment; it can be seen occasionally in some shots.
 
     She's tough, but fair.
