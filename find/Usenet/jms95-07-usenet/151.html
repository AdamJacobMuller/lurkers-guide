21 Jul 1995<PRE>     The tracking of people, notifying and confirming hirings is the job
jointly of the Unit Production Manager (Kevin Cremin last season, Skip
Beaudine this season), and the Line Producer (John Copeland).  When we
gear up, everyone is checked on availabilities, and if there's nay
(any) problem, they have plenty of time to adjust.  Usually there are
lots of folks in that department who can give recommendations, and there
is quite a list of folks who want to work with us.
 
     When there *is* a major change in crew or staff, Doug and I are
brought into it, to confirm and ratify.  If it were a really big change,
as in a cinematographer, then WB would get into the approvals process.
