<H2>BABYLON FIVE BEEF!</H2>
22 Jul 1995<PRE>     This was one of the problems created early on by reporters looking to
create a feud.  What I *said* was, "We hope to kick Star Trek's butt, by
providing some real competition, and they can kick ours, and in this
process of each trying to out do the other, the ultimate beneficiary is
the audience."  It's the same point I've made here again and again.
 
     It's amazing what can happen to a quote when you leave off part of
it.
