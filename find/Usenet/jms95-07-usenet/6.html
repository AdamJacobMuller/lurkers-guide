<H2>Attn JMS: Would you attend a p</H2>
4 Jul 1995<PRE>     If fans would be willing to endure such a terrible burden, I would
kind have to share it.  I just can't imagine anyone willingly thinking
that this was a Good Thing.  I mean, sitting through 112 hours of ANYthing
is a very daunting notin.
 
     Or notion.
