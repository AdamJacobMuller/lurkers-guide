<H2>ATTN JMS: L. Ron Hubbard and D</H2>
10 Jul 1995<PRE>     Never read Dilbert.  As for ElRon...I know people who were there the
night of the party, decades ago, when L. Ron -- then making a penny a word
for westerns and SF and other genres -- was told, "Look, you want to make
REAL money, get into the religion biz."  That night, he went home and
began cranking out Dianetics, written on butcher paper (his usual medium,
which he kept on a roll behind his typewriter, and would rip as needed).
