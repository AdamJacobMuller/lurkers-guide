<H2>It's Official !  B5 Comics Get</H2>
7 Jul 1995<PRE>     Nope.  The CBG info is old.  I was just told yesterday that the
contract for the B5 comic has been extended through 24 issues total, not
the 11 noted in the article, which gives us a year and a half or so to
build the audience further for the book.  It's doing well, and having only
been out for six issues, needs a fair shot at finding its audience.
