18 Jul 1995<PRE>     Re: your (Vinay's) experiences lately with doctors and x-rays, here's
one I don't know if I've mentioned or not before.
 
     About, oh, a year ago, I went in for my usual checkup, and my doctor
took a chest x-ray (I was kinda stressed, and he wanted to take a look).
So the x-ray comes in, and he says, "You have a shadow across your
heart."
 
     "What the hell does THAT mean?" I asked.
 
     "I don't know," he said, "I've never seen anything quite like it.  I
can't tell if it's an enlarged vessel casting a shadow, or some unusual
muscle tissue, or what.  So I took it downstairs to a cardiologist and
asked for his opinion."
 
     "So what'd he say?"
 
     "He said, "The guy's got a shadow across his heart."
 
     There've been several x-rays since, no change, nothing ominous,
except they can't quite figure it out.
 
     Ah, modern medicine....
