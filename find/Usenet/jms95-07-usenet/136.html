<H2>ATTN: JMS  What's it like befo</H2>
19 Jul 1995<PRE>     It's really kind of hard to explain; it's a mix of many things, some
tension (everything has to be ready to go on July 31st, no delays, no
revisions, no backsies); it's a bit like going back to school after a long
summer break (less so for me, since my "summer break" is filled with
the summer school of writing scripts)....
 
     A dead stage is a dark, depressing thing.  No actors, no sound, just
H8xX[Jedifices standing and waiting for someone to give them life.  Now, slowly,
you have carpenters appearing, set dressers appearing, lighting crews
appearing, and there's sound, hammers banging and cranes lifting and drills
whirring...people walking from set to set discussing revisions,
improvements...the previously empty halls are populated by runners, PAs,
directors, staff, crew...it's like this huge engine slowly beginning to
turn, and every day you hear the turbine whine growing just a little
louder until you know the sucker's about ready to take off.
 
     So there's a LOT to do; but overall it's a very good time.  As of
now, five scripts have been published in-house and in WB, and everyone is
nuts about them; the set improvements are great; the actors are excited,
and everyone's ready to kick butt.  It's cool.
