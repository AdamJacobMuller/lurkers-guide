<H2>Correspondence Note from jms</H2>
31 Jul 1995<PRE>     To all those who've sent, or are planning to send, any mail to the
actors, crew or others involved with Babylon 5 at the snail mail address
14431 Ventura Boulevard, Suite 260, Sherman Oaks, CA 91423....
 
     BE SURE to have somewhere on the envelope the words C/O BABYLON 5,
or it may very well be returned.  This is not the main studio address,
which is not disseminated, and sometimes the addresses/names get kind
of obscure.  This will allow the mail to be routed properly.  If you do
not include this line, it may never reach its destination.
