17 Jul 1995<PRE>     It is conceivable that WB, owning the rights to B5, could take and
create a sequel of its own, without my participation, except that there
would have to be payments/arrangements made.  I *may* have some clause
regarding ancillary programs in my contract as far as participation is
concerned, but not in preventing it from happening in the first place.
