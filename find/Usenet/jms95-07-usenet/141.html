<H2>Re: Why is Ford in rastb5?</H2>
21 Jul 1995<PRE>     There are any number of simple reasons why Ford is on the nets.
He is here because he is a petty, vicious, vindictive person who takes
personal joy in assaulting his "victims" as he puts it on AOL.  You want
to see the true face of FT?  Go over to the Neutral Zone in the Star Trek
main area on AOL.  He uses that phrase to describe those he disagrees
with.
 
     He's here because he likes the attention, because if he can make you
angry, it somehow validates his existence, makes him feel important, gives
him a sick thrill.  It is the same mentality witnessed in the juvenile
who throws a stink bomb into the girls locker room to watch them scurry
and get mad.
 
     He's here because he's offended by the very notion that the opinion
of ANYone else should be considered in any way more valuable, informed or
popular than his own.  If a question is asked of me, he's upset and stamps
his little foot...why should I be asked for an opinion if HE wasn't?  My
opinion *can't* matter any more than his, the very notion is abhorrent to
him.  He is that sort of creature noted by Kurt Vonnegutt in "Welcome to
the Monkey House," who if he cannot see well, insists that others be
blinkered; if he cannot run quickly, others must be hobbled.  There is
just room enough in Ford's universe for Ford; anything else must be
attacked, dismissed, ridiculed, abused.
 
     He's here because he's a net-stalker after someone with notoriety,
no different than the kind of person who follows around celebrities and
leaves harrassing notes, and when he doesn't like what they say, snarls
and accuses them of one thing or another.  He is here because he's a
bigot, stating that because of someone's job description -- producer or
writer -- that person is, de facto, a liar, untrustworthy.  A socio
economic racist.  If he were to say such things about jews, or african
americans, as a class, he would be instantly seen for what he is, but he
can hide his bigotry behind the notion of accepted cliche.
 
     He's here because he feels he has a *right* to be here, to say
anything he wants, and anybody who says otherwise, who squeaks any kind
of protest, is attacking his freedom, is a kneejerk worshipper of
the object of his hateful obsession...but who has no compunction
against sending faxes of my messages to Warner Bros., as he has done, to
try and force them to force me off the nets and shut off MY opinion.
Because the universe should rightly favor the opinion of Ford and nobody
else.
 
     He's here because he can enjoy the privilege of striking from
the shadows, of making statements without the least factual proof behind
them, vanishing when convenient and lashing out when convenient, all from
the warm recesses of blessed anonymity, because nobody here monitors his
activities, his words, his job, his off-line truthfulness.
 
     He makes pretense of being open-minded and fair...but again, those
on AOL, just go check out the messages referenced above to see his true
face.  He posts ratings when they show B5 not in the top 20, because
it's rerun time, and carefully omits noting that B5's overnights are now
higher than Voyager's (1.7 from Voyager to 2.9 for B5, both in reruns),
because he has staked his opinion on the often-repeated assertion that
ratings = quality, and the universe of Ford cannot allow, cannout
countenance, the notion that B5 might be rating higher than Voyager.
Hence the telling omission.
 
     He does not sow, neither does he reap.  He exists here only to be
difficult, to insult, to enrage, to inflame and excorciate and belittle
because it makes him feel like a big man, makes him feel like he's done
something with his life...he *enjoys* it when the folks here get mad.  He
gets off on it.  The worst thing you can do is get upset because that's
what he likes.  You're doing *exactly* what he wants you to do.
 
    The only thing to do with him is to simply ignore him, and do not
respond directly.  I do not read his messages, I only sometimes run into
bounce-backs in a quoted message from somebody else.  Because he is, in
the end, a sad and pitiable figure, our resident Gollum who bites and
snaps because he can do no other, because he sees in the world at large
only a reflection of himself...it fills his world, and reinforces what he
believes the world to be.
 
     If I were to ask *anything* of this group, and I've rarely asked
much of anything...it'd be to simply ignore him.  Don't respond, because
no matter what you say, however logical or reasoned your argument, it
will be twisted and turned and distorted, returned with insult and
derision, regardless of your statement's merit.  If you know that going
in, then it becomes clear that there's no point, really, in writing or
saying anything to him, because you know what the response will be
even before you write it.  Just leave him  be.  If he consistently fails
to find the sustence his obsession demands, he will soon enough leave to
lick his wounds elsewhere, and complain about the mean people who
refused out of spite to validate his existence and his opinions by virtue
of response.  He is that kind of person who must verify his existence by
the echo produced by his shoutings.  Do not be that echo.
 
     (And perhaps this should be reposted when next he comes round, if
anyone cares to archive it; I frankly can think of nothing else to say
to or about him or his ilk.  If I say anything, it's "Why should HIS
opinion matter?"  If someone else says anything, it's "Why are you talking
on his behalf?"  No win.  So maybe keeping this around, and pointing to
his more obvious tricks, will help keep this a tidier and more pleasant
place to hang out.)
