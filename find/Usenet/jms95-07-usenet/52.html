12 Jul 1995<PRE>     Elizabeth: you're correct, in that nothing can stop individual copies
from floating across the Atlantic.  That's going to happen, and has
happened, for some time.  What sent off fireworks and red flags was the
notion of *mass producing* these things.  That's the kind of thing that
gets you raided by the FBI.
