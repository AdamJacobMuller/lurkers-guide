<H2>Attn JMS: In your copious free</H2>
17 Jul 1995<PRE>     Probably the author I'm biggest on in general, with a very few
lapses, is Jonathan Carroll, a contemporary dark fantasist who does things
with language I can't figure out for the life of me; the closest thing in
literature to close-up magic.  It's *right there* but you can't see how he
created that image.  Beyond that, alas, I don't have much time for reading
right now....
