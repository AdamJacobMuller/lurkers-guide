<H2>JMS: The Child is Father to Th</H2>
21 Jul 1995<PRE>     I've just written...oh...about 20 messages in the last hour, from
questions here...none of them stopped me.  This one did.  I guess I
didn't see it coming.  Some personal stuff I don't generally get into on
the nets.  I'll sometimes talk about it at conventions, but I try not to
drag it in here.  But since it's come up, I guess I can handle the
answer.
 
     No, I didn't have a particularly great upbringing.  I grew up within
an abusive, alcoholic, wife-beating environment.  We moved every six
months or every year, trying to stay one step ahead of creditors, used the
last name "Stark" when Straczynski was too "hot."  I really didn't
understand the situation much; I figured every family was like this.  I
didn't begin to really get a sense of how crummy it was until I began to
see how other families *did* have normal lives.
 
     My feeling about it overall is...don't whine or whinge about it,
deal with it and move on.  Too many people use crummy childhoods to
explain away crummy behavior in the present.  That doesn't wash with me.
Does that "emotional baggage" still "haunt" me, to use your terms?  No,
not really.  Am I still pissed about some of it?  Hell yes.  Why not?
 
     There's a line in a Billy Joel song..."You still have a rage inside
you / That you carry with a certain pride / It's the only part / Of a
broken heart / You could ever save."  That's kinda it, but not quite so
maudlin or self-indulgent.  Anybody who had a perfect, blemish-free
youth and adolescence raise your hand....
 
     That's what I figured.  So we deal with it.
 
     (Great joke...when Jesus intervened in the stoning of a woman and
said, "Let you who are without sin cast the first stone," and suddenly a
rock comes flying into frame, and he says, "Mommmmmmmm!")
 
     I do tend to use some of it in my work, because it grounds me in
reality, and the reality of *the scene*.  I used a lot of it in an
episode I wrote for TWILIGHT ZONE, "Acts of Terror," about a wife
beater...which ended up being used (and is still used) at some shelters
for battered women in counseling centers, about how to find your own
power and authority.  But that's what a writer does; I've used bits and
pieces of my life all over the show, including the scene between Sinclair
and Catherine Sakai when they get back together for the first time, which
is almost verbatim from stuff I've gone through.
 
     If there's anything that has stayed with me, it's manifested itself
in a fierce loyalty to friends, because when you move every 6-12 months,
you don't get much chance to find them.  I grew up in the streets of Newark
and less terrific places, and you learn a little something about sticking
together when you grow up in the streets.  Anytime somebody wants to take
on a friend, they have to go through me first.  Hurt me and I'll hurt you
back in equal proportion; hurt a *friend* and I'll tear your fucking head
off.  And then I'll get nasty.
 
     Is that a particularly salutory trait?  No, not really.  It sounds
good on paper, but it puts me into constant trouble.  I've tried to
moderate that a little...but how do you moderate loyalty?  When the phone
rings at 3 a.m. and it's someone you know in pain or in trouble or in
jail...how do you quantify and decide *this* time you'll go but *next*
time you won't?
 
     So yeah, I've had a tough ride.  I sacrificed a lot to get here; I
have zero social life, except for my pal Harlan.  I haven't been to a
party in something like two years; don't get out to see movies but maybe
4-6 times a year; when I was breaking in, I had to choose often between
food and writing supplies...and always chose the latter, and if you look
in one of the back issues of WD, you'll see a picture of me from taht
period, at 6'5" weighing about 150-160 pounds.  But that was my *choice*.
We all gotta do what we gotta do; I decided that I'd either make it as a
writer, or I wouldn't make it at *all*.
 
     Because sometimes, kiddo, that's what it takes.
 
     But with all of that...the present-tense reality is that I'm pretty
reasonably content.  I'm doing the only thing in the world I'm the least
goddamned good at, and people are actually *paying* me to do that which
I'd have to do for free otherwise, because I can do no other.  I have a
nice house, and I work on a show I enjoy, I write what I want...so I'm not
angry all the time, as I was once before.  Most days I figure that's a
good thing; other times, I worry if it's taken the edge off the work.  But
in the interim consideration...I'm content.
 
     As for pursuing a Psychology degree...wasn't out of any particular
desire to understand myself.  Hell, at that time, I hardly even wanted to
associate with myself, much less understand myself.  No, I just went in
with the assumption that you should never major in writing if you really
want to BE a writer...learn other stuff, read other books, see other kinds
of lives...become a generalist, so you can apply a little bit of everything
to the work.  That seemed most conducive to being a generalist.
 
     Until Skinner came along and suddenly math was involved.
 
     But that's another story for another time....
 
                                                                  jms
