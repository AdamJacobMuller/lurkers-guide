<H2>Attn JMS: Your thoughts on TV</H2>
21 Jul 1995<PRE>     The lead paragraph notwithstanding...I'm quite pleased by the TV
Guide article, all things considered.  There are a few things one can
nitpick, but the overall tenor and tone is very complimentary, and after
all the hassles with Jarvis (now gone, I hear), I think we have a chance
to get a leg up on next season and some decent PR.
