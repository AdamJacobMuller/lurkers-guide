<H2>More sci-fi on TV!</H2>
8 Jul 1995<PRE>     I saw a promo (4-mins) for Space at Chicago Comic Con; my first
thought was that the CGI was *awfully* blurry/low res, I hope that was
only test footage for the promo reel.  Other than that, with Morgan and
Wong backing it, at least I have good hopes for the writing.
