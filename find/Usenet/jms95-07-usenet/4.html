<H2>Lestat reprieved (Send forth y</H2>
4 Jul 1995<PRE>     Uh-oh.
 
     When I saw faq in your inquiry to me, insofar as I knew, we were just
discussing a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) file, the same as we've seen
many times before.  I did NOT know that it was essentially a note saying
that mass reproduction services were being offered for episodes.
 
     Whether money is charged or not is not the issue; if someone is making
group copies of episodes for others, that is an infringement of copyright,
and *believe me*, Warners will come down hard on anyone doing this.
It's common practice to make 1-2 copies of something for an archive, or
for a friend, but to make multiples like this and supply them in htis
(this) fashion is going to put you in deep legal shit with the suits at
WB, *trust* me on this.
 
     I would strongly urge you to reconsider.  Your heart is in the right
place, as far as enthusiasm for the show goes, but to do this on the
scale you are suggesting breaks not only US and UK laws individually, but
collectively as well, and you could end up in serious trouble.
