<H2>Re: Why is Ford in rastb5?</H2>
22 Jul 1995<PRE>     John: I don't think FT cares about winning the argument at all;
it's just pissing in other people's tea that gets him off.  And yes, he
has as much *right* to be here as anyone; that wasn't my point, so much
as pointing out the contradiction between his feeling that he should be
here, and his actions to get me off because I don't have that same
right.  The operative term is hypocrisy.
