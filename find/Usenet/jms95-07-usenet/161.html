23 Jul 1995<PRE>     Recurring actors can be dealt with in any number of ways; if it's
a person who appears in, say, 8 episodes, we make a deal for that number
in general, and have first call on them when needed; if it's a part that
occurs maybe 2-3 times in a season, you can't make that deal, but in our
case, I tend to know which episodes a character will appear in long before
the scripts or outlines are ever written, so we make a deal for those
specific dates.
