<H2>ATTN JMS: CHICAGO COMICON QUES</H2>
18 Jul 1995<PRE>     Individuals paid anywhere from $600-$900 in the auction, designed to
help make up the shortfall when Big Bang stiffed Michael to the tune of
$5,000.  The total from the auction raised $3,800, to which I added
$1,200.  This does not, in my mind, defer CMC's responsibility to make
good on the balance of his payment; my hope is that it would show what the
fan community is REALLY made of, and to shame CMC into doing the right
thing.  So far, from CMC...dead silence.
