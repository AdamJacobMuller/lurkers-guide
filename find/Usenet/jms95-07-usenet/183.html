<H2>ATTN JMS: What are your inspir</H2>
26 Jul 1995<PRE>     I didn't look to any writers or other works for inspiration for B5;
I came up with the story mine own self.  To "look for inspiration" always
sounds deliberate to me, "Hmm...whose template can I use...?"  I don't
work that way.  It's basically the product of all the stuff I've seen and
read over the years, my interest in politics, philosophy, literature,
sagas, SF, language, culture, history...it's this huge, honking stew
which I more or less fitted into the B5 statin.
