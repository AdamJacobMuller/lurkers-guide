<H2>Quickie from jms</H2>
15 Jul 1995<PRE>     The weekend of July 29th, I'll be doing a presentation at San Diego
Comic Con that Saturday from 11 a.m. - 1 p.m.  If you're anywhere in the
area, I suggest you try and be there.  You may need to get there a bit
early; each time I've done one of these presentations, even though they
keep giving me progressively bigger rooms, they keep filling up.
 
     Couple more merchandising items in the works, looks like they might
be kinda cool.
 
     As noted in a side-topic, and thus probably missed, Dell has signed
to do 5 more B5 novels.
 
     The B5 stage is getting busier every day, as more folks begi
reporting back to work.  The first batch of scripts are being broken down
by the Assistant Directors into shooting schedules, construction is going
bigtime on a couple new sets and a total redesign of another (Medlab), all
continues on-track for day one of shooting on July 31st.
 
     To the best of my knowledge, Michael O'Hare has *still* not been paid
the balance of his fee for appearing at Big Bang, a total of $5,000.  Nor
has there even been any contact from them.  Phone calls remain unreturned.
 
     We hope, in a few weeks, to be announcing, finally, an official
Babylon 5 Fan Club, which will offer some items not available anywhere
else.  (Some of them will be made by the same people who make the real
props themselves, thus guaranteeing 100% authenticity to what'd done in
the show.)  (Make that *what's*.)
 
     We hope that, within a year or so of the fan club getting going, to
put together a *proper* B5 convention, with not only the actors, but
people from every department, giving them the chance to show what they
do, and how, and allow a chance to interact with viewers.
 
     Lately, from published figures, B5's overnights have been above those
of Voyager (3.4 compared to 2.7 or thereabouts).  Much to the surprise of
people at PTEN, B5 episodes which have now aired multiple times are still
doing very well.  This is very unusual in reruns.
 
     There *may* be some movement on the videocassette issue.  More on this
as it develops.
 
     Finally, expect a big online presence/push for the October/November
period, possibly with a B5 web page and other new on-line resources
(multimedia and the like) provided by PTEN.
 
     My sense is that right now, we're *just* about where X-Files was just
before it broke through.  I think we'll finally break through that glass
ceiling in our third season.
 
                                                                 jms
