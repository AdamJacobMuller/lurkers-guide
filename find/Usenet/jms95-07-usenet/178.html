<H2>Attn JMS: Episodes away from B</H2>
26 Jul 1995<PRE>      We do plan to continue our practice of getting more ambitious each
season; we saw virtually none of the homeworlds in year one; in year two
we began to see more of Narn, and Centauri Prime, with some locations in
the latter.  We will continue to expand in each following year; in year
three, we plan to show Minbar, more of Centauri Prime, the Narn
homeworld, Earth and *maybe* the Vorlon homeworld, if I can figure out how
to do it at this stage without totally imploding the show.
