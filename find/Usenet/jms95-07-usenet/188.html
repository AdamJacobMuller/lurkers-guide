<H2>Attn jms: Suspension of Disbel</H2>
28 Jul 1995<PRE>     I dunno...one can make the argument, as you do, that because I don't
believe in relgion, or telepathy, and have thus no axe to grind or agenda
to advance, I can do so equitably...but something about that logic sounds
a little too slick and self=contratulatory...so I'll just leave it at...
I dunno....
