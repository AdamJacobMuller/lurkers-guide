<H2>ATTN JMS: SD ComicCon: will "s</H2>
28 Jul 1995<PRE>     I don't think there'll be much problem getting in the door or getting
comic con tickets; but: come early, because the con has 27,000 people or5
more attending, and the lines to buy tickets can be absolutely hideous.
Arrive at *minimum* an hour early (10 a.m. or better).
