<H2>ATTN: JMS Why all the dreams?</H2>
15 Jul 1995<PRE>     Dreams function on many levels.  Some cultures use them as a kind of
second, or parallel reality.  They make good literary devices.  Also,
there's a fair amount of thematic undercurrent about free will vs.
predestination, and one of the ways to tap into that is to use dreams as
subtext and metaphor.
 
     My own dreams are not particularly noteworthy, except in one respect:
about 90% of them take place in the same place.  See, I always moved around
when I was a kid, spending as little as 6 months, sometimes a full year,
moving with my family from town to city to state from one end of the
country to the other.  (Don't ask.)  So I think in large measure to counter
that sense of rootlessness, my brain kinda created this "home town" and
that's where I spend much of my dreamtime.  I know the layout of the
place, where the stores are, my favorite comics/magazine shop, the same
house (in which the renovations are *finally* finished to the second
floor, I'm happy to say, and now they've gone on to doing some landscaping
and suchlike outside), there are even a couple of theaters in which I see
movies I *almost* remember the next morning.  (I actually wrote down one
of them in some detail, a Star Trek movie, belive it or not; did the
whole outline beat for beat from the dream.  Not bad.  Not good, but not
bad.)  We had a third theater in town, but it got cobbled into a mini-mall
and it's just too much of a mess.
 
     And *nothing* extraordinary happens there.  It's pretty much just a
mirror for what I do in my waking hours.  Story problems I'm working on
during the day, I'm working on "over there" at night, just in a different
mental place.
 
     Back to the show...I have, at times, used early dream images.  The
shot of Londo looking up to seeing huge ships passing overhead in "The
Coming of Shadows" is a direct dream-steal from years ago.
