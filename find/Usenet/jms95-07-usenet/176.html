<H2>ATTN JMS: Sinclair Focus?</H2>
26 Jul 1995<PRE>     Delenn is not Sinclair's "romantic consort," to use the phrase you
invoke.  There was a closeness between them, and a relationship there,
but not romantic.  Several of your questions are based on assumptions
that are not necessarily correct.
 
     A goodly portion of the Sinclair/Minbar thread will be dealt with
this coming season.
