<H2>Attn JMS: When it all over, in</H2>
10 Jul 1995<PRE>     I'd kinda like to take *all* the remaining months off that are
allotted to me, and just write when I want to.
 
     Which, sadly, knowing me, will probably be full-time anyway.
 
                                                                jms
