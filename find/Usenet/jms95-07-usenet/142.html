<H2>B5's emmy nominations</H2>
21 Jul 1995<PRE>     Three Emmy nominations is great, from where we sit; we got one on
the pilot movie (and won), two on the first season (won another), and
now three on the second season...and there are several vital categories
we haven't heard from yet, which won't be decided for another couple or
three weeks: directing, sound editing, music and visual EFX, and we have
hopes of nailing at least one more in that group.
 
     It's sobering when you stop to realize that of all the shows on
network and syndication, only *eleven* dramatic series were chosen for
nomination in various categories...with B5 earning as many nomations, or
in some cases more than, Lois And Clark, Murphy Brown, Murder She Wrote,
The Tonight Show, DS9 (with 2), the Simpsons and many others.
 
     Actors *always* get overlooked in genre shows, that's unfortunately
the nature of the beast.  So that aside, we're nothing but pleased.
