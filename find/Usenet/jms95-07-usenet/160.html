23 Jul 1995<PRE>     Yes, you're correct, the alignments in B5 vary depending on whose
agenda is in force at that moment; and they change with time.  But in
general you always need conflict, especially in TV, and to varying degrees
in other works.  It's the seed from which drama emanates.  When I was on
Murder, She Wrote, you couldn't just have Jessica go to somebody and get
the information easily.  There had to be some conflict involved, there had
to be *work* to pry it loose.  Otherwise it just falls flat.
