<H2>Re: Attn jms: Suspension of Di</H2>
31 Jul 1995<PRE>     Although there have been many interesting anecdotal studies on
telepathy, in any laboratory model it has not yet been shown consistently
and reliably to exist.  So I'm holding the subject in personal abeyance
until the day when somebody can walk into a research lab at MIT or
elsewhere and get 10 out of 10 cards right *consitently* and *repeatedly*
under strict laboratory conditions.
 
                                                                  jms
 
     (consistently, that is)
