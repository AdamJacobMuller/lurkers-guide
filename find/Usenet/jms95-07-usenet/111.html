<H2>Big Bang Con Reports, Please?</H2>
17 Jul 1995<PRE>     Just heard that, on top of Michael getting stiffed for $5,000 of his
speaking fee, Mark Hammil's second check for the balance of his fee, a
remainder of $10,000...bounced.  As did the check for his travel
expenses.  As did Walter Koenig's second check (though in his case he was
lucky in that it happened *before* the convention and he was able to get
it, at threat of not showing up).  These people are amazing.
