<H2>ATTN: JMS - will comics spoil</H2>
10 Jul 1995<PRE>     There's only one case of this conflict, so if you want to avoid any
spoilers, here's my recommendation: when the last issue of this current
story arc comes out, resolving the Mars/Sinclair/Garibaldi thread, pick
up that last issue and stick it in a bag until after the first new ep
airs in October.  THEN read it.  You'll know it when you find it.
