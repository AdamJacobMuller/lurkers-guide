<H2>JMS:Openning music</H2>
22 Jul 1995<PRE>     Chris: the point you make is exactly right.  The music for each
season is designed to reflect the progression of that season; some feel
they don't like season two as much as one, because it doesn't summon up
the same feelings.  But that's the intent; it's not supposed to summon
up the same emotions.  It's kind of the equivilant of creating a
different cover for every new installment of a series of connected
novels.
 
     What do I have in mind for season three?  What I indicated to Chris
Franke was to look at a piece of music he did in "The Long, Twilight
Struggle" and interpolate some elements of that into the main theme, with
a very hard sound.  The piece in question is about the middle of the
first really...um...busy scene after the act break.
