<H2>Attn JMS: Speaking in Parables</H2>
23 Jul 1995<PRE>     I think that, by all rights, anybody should be able to "get" each
episode.  The only thing that varies is their degree of..er...getness.
 
     Getnosity?
 
     Whatever.
 
     The stucture is fairly straightforward: the primary story in any
given episode is relatively self-contained and self-explanatory.  You can
see that one episode, and no others, and be able to follow it.  If you
CANNOT do this, then the episode has failed.  The key, as I've noted from
the start, is that the MORE you see, or know, the MORE you can get out of
any episode.
 
     The impact of Talia's situation should be the same whether you saw
the comic or not.  (And, remember, the idea was that the comic would come
out AFTER the remaining year 2 episodes, as a nice little frisson, not as
required data.)
 
     I continue to get email and snail mail from people who are still just
now finding the show...and they watch one episode, and that's fine, then
they watch a couple/three more, and THEN they realize that there's an
overall arc, that this is a bigger story than first appears.  For those
who dig out every last detail, it's hard to imagine following the shw
(show) minus all this...but it's absolutely possible, and happens
consistently.  It's your *perception* that has altered by virtue of now
knowing what more is there.  If you don't know the rest, you can still
enjoy pretty much everything there on its most basic level, as an action
or character story.
