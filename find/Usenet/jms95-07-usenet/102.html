<H2>ATTN JMS: Just a Few Questions</H2>
16 Jul 1995<PRE>     All our CGI was being done on Amigas; I think they've now totally
transitioned to a PC base.
 
     Re: my computer...I have two, one at my home office, the other at the
B5 main stage office.  They're both pretty much the same, though: Dell
Pentium 90s, 32 megs ram, 1 gig drive (office) vs. 2 gig drive (home),
4x CD Rom, 17" monitor (Nanao vs. Supermatch), 28.8 modem, Imagine 128
bit video card (office) vs. 64bit #9gxePro (home), Soundblaster 16....
these systems didn't just arrive, guys with orange vests and cones helped
them taxi into place.
 
     If B5 runs it total five years, I'll most likely retire from TV.
 
     None of the other B5 actors are on the Internet that I know of,
though some do get printouts from folks.
 
     Currently, I watch X-Files (though lately it has seemed much in need
of a good fourth-act every episode), which is about the only genre stuff
I have time to watch consistently.
 
     To the last question, authors I'd recommend: Michael Bishop, Jonathan
Carroll, Connie Willis, Ed Bryant, any of James Blish's stuff (though he's
no longer with us)...that's all that comes to mind offhand, but there are
a bunch more I'll think of the second I get offline.
 
                                                                   jms
