<H2>ATTN JMS: Favorite Dictionary?</H2>
31 Jul 1995<PRE>     For everyday use, I tend to yank out the Oxford American Dictionary,
which is nearest at hand, and I find it very complete; for real, serious
writing stuff, then I go to my copy of the Oxgord English Dictionary,
which is sort of the Mount Olympus of dictionaries, both in complexity
and sheer weight.  Other books...Roget's Thesaurus, What's What, and a
shelf load of books on mythology, history, politics and psychology.
