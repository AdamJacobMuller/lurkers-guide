<H2>Attn JMS: How did you develop</H2>
17 Jul 1995<PRE>     My main thought on developing Sheridan was to make more of an arc
to him; Sinclair had already gone on the hero's journey to some
extent, and where he was was pretty much where he was...in the case of
Sheridan, I wanted someone who would at first not be up to the challenge
of what was ahead, and who would grow into that.  (Look at Luke
Skywalker in the first SW movie, then in Jedi; that's the hero's
journey.)
