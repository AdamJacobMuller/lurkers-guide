<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Messages from Ea</H2>
6 Sep 1995<PRE>     Whether it's "bland" or not depends on what the messsages might be,
yes?  The only thing I'll say for the episode is that it may be one of the
biggest whams of the first half of year three, and one of our most
ambitious episodes of the series.  Generally, my feeling is that titles
should augment the episode, or add something, or collapse something into
a thematic whole.  When you see what convictions are at hand, the episode
"Convictions" as a title works better; ditto for "Messages."
 
     Besides, a nice, quiet, inoffensive little title gives me a better
chance to sneak up behind you and whack the heck out of you....
