5 Sep 1995<PRE>     Sherry...thank you.  The level of attention to detail is the *only*
way that this story will be told properly.  It means you sit down with the
director, and others, and you make totally clear -- there, and in the
script -- what you saw in your head when you wrote it.  As well as repeatd
verbal themes, cues, phraseologies, it's important (since this is a visual
medium) to incorporate visual cues that add to the thematic thrust of the
piece, that create a mood, or convey an emotion or a thought on an almost
cellular level.  The hardest part is being careful not to OVER use them,
because then they lose all meaning and impact.
