<H2>Roswell Tape Rx</H2>
9 Sep 1995<PRE>     I cannot have any kind of informed opinion about the Roswell films,
since I have no more information than anyone else, which is to say, just
that which was presented in the Fox special.
 
     I can only make one observation: whenever we have had an alien
character in the show get wounded, and bleed, it's a hideously difficult
process, and you run point-to-point tubes with blood; it spurts from one
location, the spot where the tube ends.  (Just getting G'Kar's hand to
bleed in one of the final four eps was a pain in the ass.)
 
     The body upon which they performed the autopsy bled smoothly from the
entire surface of each cut and incision.  Even with the best prosthetics
available to us right now, we couldn't do this.  So if it's a fake, it's
the most clever one in history, and uses technology nobody else has yet.
The person behind it could write his own ticket in the EFX/prosthetics
business *bigtime*.
