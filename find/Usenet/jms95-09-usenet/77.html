<H2>ATTN JMS - Wolf359</H2>
21 Sep 1995<PRE>     Majel Barrett-Roddenberry and I got on quite well, as you note; we
set aside any prior misunderstandings and got on with it.  We hung out,
joked a lot together during autograph signings, had a late dinner (along
with Michael O'Hare and Ed Wasser), and she told the audience at her
presentations that she considered B5 the only other intelligent SF show
now on the air, suggesting that fans support the show.
 
     It was, overall, a very pleasant experience, problems with air
conditioning (or the lack thereof) notwithstanding.  The attendees were
great, polite and friendly and enthusiastic about the show...a most
impressive experience.  And the clips from upcoming year 3 episodes went
over *very* well, including a scene with Londo and G'Kar that is likely
my favorite of the series to date.  (Another scene with Londo and Lennier,
btw, contains a small nod to the online fans of the show; we can't and
won't use story ideas, but there's been so much humor, reams and reams
of it, every imaginable kind of joke, that I dropped one of these jokes
into an episode...one that's come up at a lot of conventions and on the
nets endlessly.  Just to acknowledge the fans in the only way I can.)
