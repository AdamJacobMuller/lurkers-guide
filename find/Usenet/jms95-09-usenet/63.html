<H2>Is Sheridan an Atheist?</H2>
12 Sep 1995<PRE>     Basically, Sheridan believes in a lot of things; he's very eclectic
in his views, can incorporate lots of different perspectives, and has a
respect for all views.  In one of the early season 3 eps, in fact, one
character upbraids him for having "no clearly defined pattern of faith,"
to which Sheridan replies, "I'm eclectic, open-minded."
