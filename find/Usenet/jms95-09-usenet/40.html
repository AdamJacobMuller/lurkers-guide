<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Request younger</H2>
9 Sep 1995<PRE>     Excuse me, but I don't believe in ageism on either end of th
spectrum.  I don't hire old writers, I don't hire young writers: I hire
WRITERS WHO CAN WRITE.  Period.  Some, like Scott Frost, are in their late
20s/early 30s; some like Peter David and Marc Zicree are in their 40s;
some like David and Dorothy and Harlan are older.  Young writers are not
intrinsically better or worse than old writers, and vice-versa.  This is,
frankly, a dumb discussion; substitute "white" or "black" for young or
old, and the stereotyping and illogic of the discussion should be evident.
