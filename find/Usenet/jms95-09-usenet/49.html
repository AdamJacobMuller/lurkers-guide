<H2>Attn jms: An Absence of Rabbit</H2>
11 Sep 1995<PRE>     No problem there.  In life, we kinda get to know what to expect on a
day to day basis...but that doesn't stop crises from coming at us out of
nowhere (though if we'd been smart enough we could've seen them coming),
and sometimes the worst thing is that we DO see it coming, and are sure we
can somehow avoid it...and still get hammered.
