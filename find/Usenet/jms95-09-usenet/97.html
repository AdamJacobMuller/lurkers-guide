<H2>Attn JMS: Dailies?</H2>
29 Sep 1995<PRE>     Dailies are prints of the film shot the day before, transferred to
videocassette for easier viewing.  It's the raw footage shot from every
angle (master, two-shots, singles, close-ups), which is also given to
the editor, who begins to create a rough assembly of the episode.
