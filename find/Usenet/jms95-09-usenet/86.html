<H2>Mira Furlan in LA Play</H2>
24 Sep 1995<PRE>     Mira Furlan, best known here as Ambassador Delenn, is currently
starring in a production of Sophocles' classic play ANTIGONE.  This
modernized version is directed by Mira's husband, Goran Gajic, and adapted
by Deanne Stillman.  It's a chance to see Mira out of makeup, and in a very
different kind of role than you've seen before.
 
     The play is currently running at the Hudson Guild Theater, 6543 Santa
Monica Boulevard, in Hollywood.  Performances are Thursdays-Saturdays at 8
p.m., Sundays at 7.  Tickets can be acquired by calling 213-660-TKTS.
