<H2>ATTN JMS: Will you write B5 af</H2>
30 Sep 1995<PRE>     The question is a bit like asking someone climbing Mount Kilimanjaro
"Think you'll do more of this again later?" when he's at the halfway
point, the ledge is half an inch across, the ice is slipping and the wind
is biting his nose off.  When I've recovered, I'll think about it....
