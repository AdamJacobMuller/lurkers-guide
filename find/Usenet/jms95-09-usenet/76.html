<H2>The dancer and the dance</H2>
20 Sep 1995<PRE>     What I love is when I hear somebody say, "Well, if Patrick Stewart
were playing this role, nobody'd say HE was wooden."  I wish those people
had a better sense of history, because when the reviews of TNG's first
season came out, just about every reviewer around called TNG's acting --
Stewart included -- wooden.
 
     Revisionism...it's a lovely thing....
