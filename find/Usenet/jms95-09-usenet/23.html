<H2>JMS: You are an idiot with mus</H2>
6 Sep 1995<PRE>     Chris: before you go around calling people (viz: me) an idiot, you
may want to, perhaps, get your facts straight.  We had planned on having
Stewart Copeland (not John Copeland, who is our producer, though this is
the name you cite) do our series music, but he declined, wanting to take
the time to tour and try to work on an album.  He was not available to us.
 
     That said, I am *extremely* happy with Christopher Franke's work, and
think it adds immeasurably to the quality of the show.
 
     Idiot comments notwithstanding.
 
                                                                   jms
