<H2>ATTN: JMS Crew Autographs</H2>
12 Sep 1995<PRE>     To get autographs, send a self-addressed stamped envelope, and what
you'd like signed, to the B5 mail drop.  (Note: WB doesn't pay for any
photos, the cast pay for those out of pocket, so it's hard for them to
oblige on this.)  The address is:
 
     14431 Ventura Boulevard, Suite 260, Sherman Oaks, CA 91423, and make
sure you put ATT: (CAST NAME), C/O BABYLON 5
