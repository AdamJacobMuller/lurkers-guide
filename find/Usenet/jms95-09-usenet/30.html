<H2>ATTN JMS: Season 3</H2>
7 Sep 1995<PRE>     I am thus far *very* happy with season three; we've got three shows
in the can (edited, not yet scored or mixed), and shooting number four
as I type this.  I think we're already a notch above our general episodes
from year two, and "Convictions" is extremely intense, with a very
different look and feel from anything we've done before.  Has kind of an
NYPD Blue feel to it.
 
     Next week we start filming "Passing Through Gethsemane," directed by
Adam Nimoy, guest-starring Brad Dourif.
