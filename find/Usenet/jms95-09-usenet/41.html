<H2>Takishima -- SPOILERS for "Div</H2>
9 Sep 1995<PRE>     Mike: your assessment is pretty much correct.  Laurel was to be the
traitor initially; as I noted long, long time ago, and you quoted, she was
not, in fact, acting entirely under her own volition.  There would indeed
have been an implanted personality there, acting without even her knowing
about it.  And it would've been this implanted personality that would've
shot Garibaldi.
 
     When I took Laurel off the board, elements of this were transferred
to other characters.  This is the kind of thing I mean when I say that even
with changes here and there, the story continues to go where I want it to
go.  We don't necessarily remember *which* general put the briefcase with
a bomb next to Hitler's chair in the bunker, only that it got done.  Some
chairs are moveable, some are not, as anyone who's ever written a novel
from an outline can tell you...you start moving the chairs around, but you
always keep going where you're going.
