<H2>Re: MO'H's Departure (was Re:</H2>
19 Sep 1995<PRE>     I can't believe this discussion has come back again.
 
     Okay, this to Robert Holland and all the other jerks who can't
seem to get it right.  This is the only thing I'm going to say on thi
issue because everything I have to say, I've said elsewhere, repeatedly,
and despite everything, this keeps coming up.
 
     Quite simply...what the fuck business is it of yours?
 
     What happens between Michael, or any other actor on this show, and me,
is my business, and theirs, not yours.  You have no right to an
information otherwise.  Fuck off.
 
     Every time this comes up, I tell the person who drags it out of the
mud, "Okay, give me the name and address of the last couple of employers
from whom YOU parted company.  Let me start speculating about that on the
nets."  But they always decline.  Because they're goddamn cowards who like
to speculate on how somebody ELSE left their job, what *really* went on,
because well, that's FUN and it's their BUSINESS and why NOT...but when it
comes THEIR turn, well, that certainly isn't right, that's not fun, and
it's nobody else's business.
 
     (And don't give me the "public persona" crap either; by posting here
ad infinitum you're just as public as anybody else in this discussion.)
 
     What infuriates me most about this is that I just got back from
spending 4 days in the company of Michael O'Hare...we were on panels
together, we had dinners, lunches and breakfasts together, we hung out
(all, I hasten to point out, in the company of witnesses), we had a great
time because we know and understand the situation, and we're both
comfortable with it.  And then I come back here to find THIS shit going
on again.
 
     Why don't you guys just get a frigging life that doesn't involve
sticking your snout into other people's business, and maybe tend to your
own...or give us the same opportunity to do the same to you, and your
employer/employee history.
 
                                                                      jms
