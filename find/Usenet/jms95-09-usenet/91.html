<H2>Space: AAB First Impressions:</H2>
25 Sep 1995<PRE>     Finally managed to catch SPACE tonight (on tape, working late), and
overall I thought it was very promising.  The production values alone are
amazing, and it's clear that every dime is right there on the screen.  It
has a lot going for it, and I wish them the best of luck.
