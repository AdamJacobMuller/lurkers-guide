<H2>JMS: Why Theo?</H2>
22 Sep 1995<PRE>     I've always liked the name Theo, from Vincent's brother, so there
was the sound of it; also the sense of it, in that Theo was a guide, a
counselor, a confidante, which Theo might come to be in this; and, finally,
Theodore means (I just lapsed on the actual definition) but either chosen
(favored) of god or messenger of god (have to check my dictionary of names
again), which is appropos.
