<H2>Attn JMS: B5 Audience Demograp</H2>
5 Sep 1995<PRE>     The demographic info is of little use to me, only to advertisers; and
in that respect, we have a large concentration in the 18-49 age range,
high disposable income, usually high school or college educated, so the
commericals have sold quickly and well for WB.
