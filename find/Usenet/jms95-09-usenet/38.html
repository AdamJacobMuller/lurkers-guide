<H2>Re: I fondled a Celebrity!!!</H2>
9 Sep 1995<PRE>     &lt;fweeet!&gt;*  Okay, folks, look, I spoke to Claudia, and the story as
recounted is fairly accurate.  Claudia was in RenFair mode, which to her
is another role to be played, and it was just in jest, horsing around.  The
thing about Claudia is she doesn't back down from any kind of challenge,
a trait she shares with Ivanova, and when called upon, responded.
