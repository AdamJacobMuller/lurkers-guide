<H2>Spoiler (tFoN): Jewish Themes</H2>
5 Sep 1995<PRE>     Moshe: an excellent analysis of the theme behind that scene, which
as you state ties directly into the theme of the whole episode, and
moreover, somewhat sets up the theme for the coming season...who will
determine your identity, the rules you follow, who will lead you, and
who you are...the question of, as you say, those who wish to accommodate
and give in to pressures from within and from without.
 
     Didn't want to be heavy-handed about it, so I figured those who got
it, got it; those who didn't, would see a nice candle scene which sets
the mood, even if they don't get the full thematic/symbolic aspects that
others would get.
                                                                    jms
