<H2>jms - What time do you get up</H2>
9 Sep 1995<PRE>     Unfortunately, in my case, I'm all over the map, depending on when
meetings are held...sometimes very early, sometimes later in the morning.
I'm usually up until at least 3 a.m. every night of the week, sometimes
as late as 4-4:30 a.m., so how much actual sleep I get is a very flexible
notion.
 
     As for the crew...crew call is 7 a.m. M-F, as a rule.  If an alien
is in the first scene, prosthetics crew can sometimes show up as early as
6:00 a.m.  Actors and crew actually hit the stage at 9 a.m.  (7-9 is spent
basically waking up, rigging lights, setting up cameras, other stuff.)
 
     We shoot until about 7 p.m., rarely any later.
