<H2>Re: MO'H's Departure (was Re:</H2>
22 Sep 1995<PRE>     I've stopped reading this thread, for obvious reasons, but thought
I'd reply to one of them in the box just to let you all know: I spoke
with Marc Zicree today about other stuff, and in the course of the
conversation, mentioned this whole situation.  He was, quite frankly,
aghast and appalled.  He offered to post a note here stating his position,
which is: that he had no first-hand information at all about the O'Hare
situation, and was operating off what he'd assumed to be the case (we had
never really discussed it, as he'd moved on to other projects long before
any of this happened).
 
     He asked me to apologize on his behalf to anyone who might have been
caught up in this because of his speculations.  Anyone who wants
confirmation of this can drop him a note, or as stated, he's willing to
come in and say this publicly.
 
                                                                jms
