<H2>JMS: Budgeting Question</H2>
6 Sep 1995<PRE>     Each show does have its own budget, but they rarely vary much from
the "pattern budget," which is the amount that overall each one should
cost.  If we do one episode that's a huge blow-out, of course, we'll try
to make the next one a little less huge, just to be sensible.
