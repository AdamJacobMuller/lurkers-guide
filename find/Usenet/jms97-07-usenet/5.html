&gt; Heya!
&gt; 
&gt; Some time back there was discussion of a Babylon 5 Information CD-ROM,
&gt; which JMS said would be "kinda subversive" in some respects.
&gt; 
&gt; Is the bloody thing out yet?  If not, WHEN?!?!?!?!?!
&gt; 
&gt; I'm driving the local Electronics shop nuts!

Geez!  Calm down a bit!  The check disk is being circulated through
Babylonian Productions even as we speak for fact checking and
operational stability.  We are working on a deal for distribution, and
will let everyone know when the deal is done.  Shouldn't be long now,
but in this group quoting a date or even a time frame is VERY
dangerous.  :-)
