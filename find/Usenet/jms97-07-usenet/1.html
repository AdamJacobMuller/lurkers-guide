28 Jun 1997<PRE>"OK, who's studios will it be filmed at? That's ashitload of equipment to
move. Will WB rent thier stuff out (not likley) Does TNT have studios in
the LA area equiped for this??"

We never shot on the WB lot.  We have our own off-lot facilities, which
will be the same for future episodes.
