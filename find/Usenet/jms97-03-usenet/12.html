<H2>Re: JMS:  Kathryn's novel</H2>
5 Mar 1997<PRE>Kathryn, for obvious reasons, is the only person on the planet whose
knowledge of the B5 universe is second only to my own.  Especially the
backstory, the history of the characters and worlds, and so on.  She's
seen virtually every frame of film.  So when I got the idea of having one
of the books follow Sinclair's story after leaving B5, through a year of
story time that weaves in and out of the books, the comic, and the
show...she was the logical candidate.  The only one that made sense.  She
was hesitant to do so at first, for various reasons, but she's always been
very fond of the Sinclair storyline, and Michael O'Hare, and wanted to
tell that story.  So she agreed to write it.

And of all the novels, this one is 100% canon...it's also the most
exhaustive attempt to tie in all the storylines done to date.  Anybody
wants to know what happened to Sinclair, it's in the book.  That's a
genuine chapter of the story arc.
