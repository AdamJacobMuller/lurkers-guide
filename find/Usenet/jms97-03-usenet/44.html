<H2>Re: Thanks, but no thanks</H2>
14 Mar 1997<PRE>"And by the way, I think it's pretty darn unscrupulous to take material
that JMS published for the enjoyment and education of B5's fans and charge
money for it. I somehow doubt that that was his intent, and your attempt
at forcing me to pay to
see material which costs you virtually nothing to publicize is disgusting
and very untypical of the high-quality fan community that B5 posseses."

Err...the material you mention is taken from my personal journal, and was
never published anywhere.  When we were coming up with the maximum we
could give to FC members to make it worth doing (and I tend to err in the
direction of doing more than less), I thought as a bonus, a niceness for
the FC members online, to put my journal up there.

Whatever you may think, you are not entitled to everything I write for
free.  And this section isn't charged for in ANY event; it wasn't even
mentioned in the original FC applications or brochures.  It's a baker's
dozen, lagniappe, a little extra we gave that only the fan club members
can have access to.

"If I wanted color photos, I'd've bought color photos. If I wanted a
button,
I'd've bought a button. But if I, as a fan, want to learn more about the
show I love, and you have the means to provide me with that online and
expect me to PAY for it."

No, the only thing involved here in FC membership and the Gold Channel. 
The informational areas on thestation.com are open to anyone; the chat
area is open to anyone; the message center is open to anyone; the station
tour is open to anyone; this one area alone is set aside for FC members.

Bottom line...it's *my* material, and I can do with it as I so choose.  If
I want to make of it a gift to FC members, I can do that.  I'm sorry you
don't like it.  And I assume that you will now let anyone use anything of
yours that they want, since to withhold or make them pay for something of
yours is the old porno trick.
