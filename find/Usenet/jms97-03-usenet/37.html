10 Mar 1997<PRE>"My question is this: If PTEN is so anxious to close up for good, why not
simply renegotiate the original contract and sell to WB, who can then
consign the fifth season to TNT for production?"

The show cannot appear in first-run on cable; the PTEN agreement
specifically precludes this, it turns out.
