10 Mar 1997<PRE>In that kind of situation, my *guess* (and that's all it would be) is that
the book would be eligible in its own Novel category, and the script would
be eligible in that category, noting the "based on" in the credits.  But
again, that's just a guess, as I haven't read *nearly* enough Alice in
Wonderland to truly appreciate or wrap my brains around how SFWA would
deal with this question.
