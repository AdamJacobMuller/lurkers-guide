<H2>Re: Jms, are you OK?</H2>
25 Mar 1997<PRE>Of the choices given....

1. Too busy. Will get back when I'm not utterly snowed under.
2. Not feeling very well at the moment.
3. Haven't anything of interest to say right now. Thought I'd wait 
    until I had some news.
4. The questions being raised at the moment have already been 
    answered or aren't addressed to me.
5. Couldn't get my computer to post to the new address 
    (b5mod@deepthot.cary.nc.us.).
6. Other (please specify if it's not top secret).

It's 1, 3, and 4, with a little of 6 going on.  I'm just completely up to
my ass in alligators with production right now.  As usual, WB wants to
hold 4 episodes for October, but that means because they held back there's
going to be a big crunch of new shows in May sweeps.  Nine eps in a row. 
So we're busting our butts to get stuff ready.

They'll be airing 310 through 318 between April 18th and June 13th.  Which
will at least give us a big boost and ramp things up.

"You're getting us worried, Great Maker. Are you OK? ( }:-( )"

Fine.  Pooped.  But fine.
