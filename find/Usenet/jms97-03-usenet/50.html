18 Mar 1997<PRE>"Have you ever had any problems writing a part for an actor you admire?"

Not really, since in 99% of all cases the program, whatever it is, is cast
*after* I turn in the script.  

"Have you ever been star struck?"

When we had Paul Williams, and Michael York...yeah, definitely.  And I
turned all fanboy, had Paul autograph 2 of my CDs for "Phantom of the
Paradise," and had York sign my laserdisk of "Cabaret."

"How do you deal with writing for people you greatly admire?"

See above.  It's usually after the fact.  In any event, I just write the
character, not the actor.
