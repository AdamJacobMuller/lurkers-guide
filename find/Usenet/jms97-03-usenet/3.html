2 Mar 1997<PRE>The CIS situation seems to now be working out; the policy of backrooming
messages has been stopped, and the larger policy is being reexamined and
may be restructured.  

Again, it's the B5 rule...if you make a stand, and approach the problem
from the perspective that you can make a difference, you can.  And it
wasn't just that it was me, believe me...it was the many, many people who
stood up and said the same thing.  You decide to change things, and you
change things.
