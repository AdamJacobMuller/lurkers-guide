7 Mar 1997<PRE>Oh those Netter financial press releases!

SRGB is a new calibration standard for a cool burning, stable,
predictable lighting for entertainment and other uses.  Currently in
development are a new "kit" of stage lights that will excite the
emulsion of film properly so that what is seen on the set can be exactly
what is realized on the film when it is transferred.  The lights are
based on a custom flourescent formulation with a digitally switched
power supply and exciter.  This is new territory, and has some exciting
possibilities for production.

The Videssence lighting is being used at B-5 primarily as "gimmick"
lighting until such time as JFlinn3 decides that it is a reasonable
replacement for the Incandescent lights that are the norm for film based
production.  When the lights are perfected, there will be no visible
color difference to the viewer.   The technology involved will allow 
smaller instruments to be used, and there will be some different effects
possible.  These will be realized after the baseline success has been
achieved.

When that happens, I will let you know what to look for!

CoProducer, B5
