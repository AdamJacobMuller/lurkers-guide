<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: The Shadow Within</H2>
25 Mar 1997<PRE>Thanks...yeah, everything I've heard back so far from fans has backed up
what I said here a while ago...that this one was the best B5 book to date.
 

Re: C4's debut...I have no direct information from WB on this. 
(Interestingly, many at WB don't know either.)  Ironicallly, I only know
what's on the nets, and some British fans said that the C4 duty officer
gave April 14th as a possible debut, but that's the extent of what I know
(or don't know) (or might know in an alternate universe, in another
incarnation) (truth is beauty, beauty truth, this is all you know and all
you need to know).
