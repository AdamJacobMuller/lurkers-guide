3 Mar 1997<PRE>"How do you balance the twin needs of story advancement and plot-point
repetition?"

It ain't easy, lemme tell you.

Basically, I sit back and say, "If I came into the story at this point,
would I be able to follow the action and make even a rough sense of it,
even if I might miss a few of the subtleties?"  If not, then I backtrack
and layer in whatever I think is necessary.  Sometimes I think I err
slightly in the direction of too much recap, but I'd rather do that than
totally confuse people.

I know it makes our regulars nutsoid, but there isn't any way around it
since we can't do a "last week on B5" segment.
