28 Mar 1997<PRE>Yeah, the Starship Straczynski is in Jack's novel as a result of a charity
auction.  I could never do it in my own work, but the idea of a starship
with that name was very funny to me, and I held my own in the auction
(this was a long time ago) against a woman with an even longer and more
convoluted name than my own to get that one.
