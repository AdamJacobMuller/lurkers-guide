<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Joseph Campbell and the Hero's Journey</H2>
4 Mar 1997<PRE>I'm definitely familiar with Campbell's work.  In the case of B5, it was
sort of in the back of my head, but I didn't work to stick to the
progression point for point, because I was afraid then it becomes
mechanical.  "Hero" is good for analysis *after* the fact, not during...if
you try to apply it during the creative process, it becomes like the
centipede asked which foot goes first.  It's an analytical device, not a
creative device.  

That was the problem with "Beyond Thunderdome."  Prior to then the Mad Max
movies were written on their own terms; prior to BT, George Miller read
"Hero," and worked too hard to make it all fit.
