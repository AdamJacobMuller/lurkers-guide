14 Mar 1997<PRE>Hi 5heads!

Letterboxing will not happen on TNT.  Sorry. They will be showing the
original episodes uncut, in their original broadcast form. 

If and when DVD happens for B5 it will most certainly be 16:9.  All of
the prep work is done for that release.


George Johnsen
CoProducer, B5
