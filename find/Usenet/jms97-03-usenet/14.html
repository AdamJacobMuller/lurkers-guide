"While I'm certainly willing to believe that the director did it here,
this is not a straight answer, in that "Cut" ended up part of the show,
and was therefore in the script, at least after the fact."

No, it was never in the script, before or after.  We just grabbed the
whole audio because it worked.

"By way of example, surely an actor playing a director shooting a scene
could shout either instruction, yes?"

Sigh...
