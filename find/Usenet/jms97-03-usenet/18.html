7 Mar 1997<PRE>Ralph-

I just pulled the Atonement master and looked at the scene you
mentioned.  I don't see the problem, but that doesn't mean that i doubt
your tape.  There are several ways it could have happened, from uplink
error to downlink error to local affiliate error.  We did experience a
problem in the ISN broadcast recently where the uplink dropped out, and
there was a hold frame during a shot of Dan the Reporterman for 2
frames, but that doesn't appear to be the problem you describe. 

Can you be any more specifc as to symptom?
