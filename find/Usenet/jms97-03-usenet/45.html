14 Mar 1997<PRE>Brad-

The first model out will be the Starfury.  The model business is still a
very tedious process, as any manufacturer will tell you.  We sent out
blueprints and three views of the Starfury months ago, and they have
just asked for more this week.  They have a sculptor building a master,
and then they will cut steel tooling, whick will be test shot, test
built, and refined before we see it on the shelf.  All in all a tediuos
and frustrating process.  

Fortunately, the process on different models can work simultaneously, if
they are not using the same sculptor.  The release schedule will be
adjusted as the project proceeds.

It is interesting that the merchandising for B5 is starting to get
REALLY hot.  Warners Special Products is really B5 happy right now. 
Hope this bodes well for future products!
