9 Mar 1997<PRE>Here is what will happen between now and 1 March 97
        to your Babylon 5.  &lt;long description follows&gt;
                You may change one -- and only one --
                thing, large or small, that concerns
                Babylon5.  Choose.  Choose NOW.
Your choice, joe?


More chocolate frosted doughnuts on the craft services table on days when
we have lots and lots of extras and I don't get my fix when I arrive in
the morning.
