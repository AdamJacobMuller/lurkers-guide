5 Mar 1997<PRE>Understand that WB does not provide photos to the cast for publicity
purposes; neither does Babylonian.  Any photos provided by the cast come
out of their own pockets.  The cost is *very* prohibitive given the number
of fans requesting same.  The cast tries to oblige as much as they can,
because that's the sort of people they are, but be advised that this is a
burden on them....
