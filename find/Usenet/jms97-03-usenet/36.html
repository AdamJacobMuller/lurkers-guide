10 Mar 1997<PRE>That's one of the things about scripts...lots of people (and I'm
generalizing this beyond SFWA) like to pretend that a script is somehow
vastly different than any other kind of writing, often because they have
an agenda (including the notion that you have to pay $450 per session for
a consultant to teach you how to read it), but fundamentally...a story is
a story is a story.  Dialogue is dialogue.  Only the margins vary.
