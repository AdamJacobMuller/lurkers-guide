<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: What do you think of new MST3K?</H2>
3 Mar 1997<PRE>I've only seen the first 2 installments (the second 2 are on tape,
awaiting a time when I have 4 hours to spend), and I think they're doing
well.  The new Crow is generally okay, though the person doing the
voice/puppetry (his name just fell out of my head) needs to animate him a
bit more.  Trace understood that you have to make Crow a living character,
and it ain't just the voice.  Crow had very visual and expressive
movements, which so far the new guy hasn't quite gotten yet.  

I wasn't that impressed with Dr. Forrester's mom in the previous season,
but she seems to be doing well now that she's out on her own, much more
interesting.

I still miss Trace, though...he added a LOT to that show's edge.
