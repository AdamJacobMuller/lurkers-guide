<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Shakespeare</H2>
12 Mar 1997<PRE>I've considered the "was it/who was Shakespeare" discussion...and while
it's academically interesting, it doesn't much pull me in.  Doesn't
matter, in one sense.  Doesn't matter of Macbeth was written by him, or
someone else, or a frighteningly advanced species of peacock that to
everyone's surprise evolved an opposable thumb...it's still one of the
great masterworks of the english language.

"Truth is beauty, and beauty truth; that is all you know and all you need
to know."
