7 Mar 1997<PRE>David-

A complete film print is never made.........yet.  (I have learned that
never is a very bad word used in this forum:-))

The international (read PAL/SECAM) and archival (read 16:9) versions are
from a conformed negative, that has black placed where the effects shots
are.  Those shots are converted or remade from the digital source, and
cut into the show in the WB resolution independent post environment.

We have done tests (early on and recently) to prove that the CG and
composites can hold up to film transfer, so who knows what the future
will bring? BUT... there is no complete film prints of any episode at
this time.
