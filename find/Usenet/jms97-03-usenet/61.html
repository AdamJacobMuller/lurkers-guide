29 Mar 1997<PRE>Yeah, Jeanne did a great job on the book.

And what you describe is exactly the approach I've already begun taking
with the books, and will continue to do so in future: using them to
explore the areas and things that are mentioned in the show but not
actually shown, background and foreground stories, linked to the history
of B5.

There's a thousand years of story there to play with....
