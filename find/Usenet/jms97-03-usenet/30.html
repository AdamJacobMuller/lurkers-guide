9 Mar 1997<PRE>I forget which company, but one of the companies that produces
high-quality figures (about 10" high, individually boxed) will be coming
out with B5 characters in the near future, now that the deal is closed. 
They'll come out in groups of three, starting with Sheridan, Delenn and
G'Kar.  The second batch will be Londo, Ivanova and Kosh.  I can't recall
the next batch offhand, though certainly Garibaldi is in it.
