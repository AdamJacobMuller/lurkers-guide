<H2>Re: ATTN JMS: Apologies for Megacon</H2>
18 Mar 1997<PRE>I was, and remain, very upset about the video/audio situation, especially
since I made a point of going to the area a few hours earlier (as some who
were sitting around waitinf for Peter's panel can testify) to check out
the equipment, and told everyone concerned that I didn't think it was
going to work out right, but they *insisted* that they'd tested it, and it
would be fine...and wouldn't change it...and, of course, it sucked.

I'm assured that, if I come there again, this will not happen again.  I
don't know if that's going to be a good enough guarantee, it may take a
little more than that next time.  

I love it when someone tries to say, "No, no, our experts and techs
checked it."  HEY!  I WORK IN TEEVEE!  I PRODUCE A SERIES!  I KNOW WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT DON'T TAKE ME FOR HAVING JUST FALLEN OFF THE TURNIP
TRUCK!  

...sigh....
