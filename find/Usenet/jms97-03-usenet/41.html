No, I wouldn't like to have B5 lost in a nuclear holocaust, but film
won't do us any good in that instance, as the theatres will also be
blasted, methinks.  

As to the issue of archival, there is no complete film print, but all of
the live action sequences are conformed on negative, plus the animation
files are stored so that they can be recreated and rerendered at
whatever resolution is needed (post explosion, of course).

This protects us from allowing our follow on civilizations from being
fooled by the shadows.
