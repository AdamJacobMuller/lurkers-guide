<H2>Re: Worries about TNT showing B5?</H2>
7 Mar 1997<PRE>It's my understanding that TNT will not cut anything from the shows...in
fact, due to PTEN dropping the Kung Fu 30 second promo (temporarily filled
by a 30 second B5 promo at 40 minutes into the program), we were told this
week that we now have an additional 30 seconds that we can add to the
show's length.  When we heard this, we asked if we were to put this in
only to have it cut by TNT later, but were told that it would be left
intact.  (They can't put in any more commercials because it's currently at
the maximum allowable limit under FCC rules.)

I imagine the logo will appear, as it standard with all such shows.

I have to say that TNT has proven to be *very* excited about picking up
B5, and they want to do a great deal of promotion for it, and plan to make
it a real centerpiece.  If fans of the show want to write to them to
continue to encourage this, and to thank them for wanting to treat the
show right (thus encouraging more of this in future), and suggest their
support and creative freedom for the upcoming sequel now in negotiations,
I certainly think nobody would object....
