<pre> Rebecca Eschliman &lt;76072.2345@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I'm not surprised -- why else would the universe of B5 feel so
&gt; real? But on a tangent, do you find that there are new characters
&gt; that keep cropping up in your imagination beyond the scope of the
&gt; current 5-year arc that nag to have their stories told?

      There's always new stuff cropping up and creeping in; half the
struggle in this show is deciding what to tell, and what not to
tell...it just goes on and on.

                                                                  jms
