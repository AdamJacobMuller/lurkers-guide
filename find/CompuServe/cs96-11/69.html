<pre> Alan Mulvie &lt;100566.1444@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; both positive and negative, to be an asset or a burden?
&gt; What is the main arc for the next 18 months?

"Would YOU have continued with Babylon 5, in the way you have done so,
without the feedback from fans?"

      Absolutely.  More than anything else, I'm making the show, and
telling this story, for myself; it's the story I'd want to see.  I'm
doing it because I can't *not* do it.

"Do you feel the critasism. both positive and negative, to be an asset
or a burden?"

      Neither.  It's a sense of the room, which is always good, but in
general what you find is that for everything you do in a given episode,
there will be some who hate it, and some who love it...there is no
single strong concensus. So what you have to do is to just listen to
the inner voice of the story and follow that, regardless.  If you start
trying to second guess everyone's reaction...that way madness lies.

      On a personal side, it can sometimes be a bit stressful, but I
said I'd be accountable one way or another, and that promise stands.

                                                                  jms
