<pre> Chad Underkoffler &lt;102512.1310@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; How off-base is this?
&gt; My question is this: did the scene we saw of MG in WHtMG happen
&gt; in "reality" or is it the deranged babling's of Michael's mind
&gt; trapped within a Control overlay?

      No, that scene happened in reality.

                                                                  jms
