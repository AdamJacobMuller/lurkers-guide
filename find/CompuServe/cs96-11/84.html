      Thanks.  Yes, by building up Cartagia offscreen, it helped pave
the way for what we do finally see.

      And the only reason to not hold back Sheridan for one more ep
was my feeling that if I held him *and* Garibaldi back, it'd be a bit
much.

                                                                  jms
