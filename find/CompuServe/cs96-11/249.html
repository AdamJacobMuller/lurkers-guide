<H2>Missing Joshua?</H2>
<h3>Date: 26 Nov 1996 18:12:34 -0700</h3>
<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;75063.3305@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is something up with Joshua Cox?
&gt; Other obligations?

       Just haven't had enough for him to do to merit bringing him in.

                                                                  jms
