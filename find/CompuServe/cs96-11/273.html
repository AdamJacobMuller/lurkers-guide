<pre> Michael R. Brehmer &lt;75303.2242@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; If the Vorlons are now hell-bent to destroy the Shadows, why
&gt; nibble around the periphery and not blow-up Zhadum first? If the
&gt; Vorlon "parenta" approach has been used for so many eons, why
&gt; start destroying everything in their path now? Morden must know
&gt; that that the Centauri are no match for the Vorlons; so why ask
&gt; them to send up their ships as a defense shield? I wonder if there
&gt; is a "Peace party" among the Shadows? Is Earth a Vorlon target?
&gt; Is B5 a Vorlon target?
&gt; How can the AoL stand up to both the Vorlons and the Shadows?

      Excellent questions to which I, alas, can only reply, "wait and
see."
