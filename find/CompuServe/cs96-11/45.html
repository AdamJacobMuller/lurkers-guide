<pre> S J NICHOLSON &lt;76574.1663@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Didn't it have some of the first season music incorporated into
&gt; it?

      Thanks.  It's a terrific episode.  The music now echoes season
one because in some thematic areas, we're starting to bend back on
ourselves, and close some circles, as you'll see soon.

      That it affects the emotions is, for me, the goal.  If you can
make an audience *feel* something, in a medium as cold as TV, you've
done your job right.

                                                                  jms
