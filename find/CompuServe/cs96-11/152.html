<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;75063.3305@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Can I take it that you chose a man with the same general physique
&gt; as Walter Koenig and had him wear an opaque mask (something we've
&gt; not seen before and that wouldn't be required if you're coming in
&gt; to inspect someone who'd passed-out) for a reason?

      Who would do a thing like that?

                                                                  jms
