<H2>Londo's Bug</H2>
<h3>Date: 19 Nov 1996 12:10:03 -0700</h3>
<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;75063.3305@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; If Londo's quarters were being bugged regularly, why on Centauri
&gt; Prime didn't they bug the cells as well? And when did you notice
&gt; the spit? Before or after you edited the episode together?

       I figured Londo would've bribed the guards to shut down the
bugs. Also, there's reason to bug a political figure's quarters...but a
cell in which there is just one person, who in theory has no allies
with whom to conspire...that would likely have a low priority.

                                                                  jms
