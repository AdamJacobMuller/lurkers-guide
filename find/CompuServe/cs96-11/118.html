      I read what you said.

      Reading and writing is what I *do*.

      Perhaps what you said was not what you meant.

      It's my experience that unless you can say what you mean, you
can never mean what you say.

      What was written was a very intolerant message about bi's, and
based upon that point of view, you gigged the show for not applying a
political agenda.  I don't think something as inherently personal and
intimate as sex should be politicized by either end of the spectrum,
and used to dismiss one class or another because of it.  I'm an
extremist for tolerance.

      If some portion of what I quoted back to you was reprinted
inaccurately, or paraphrased, or otherwise changed, please let me know
and I will correct it.  Otherwise, what you said was what you said.  It
didn't upset me, didn't make me mad, because I'm not at issue here...I
only wanted you to understand what you were saying by sending it back
to you.

                                                                  jms
