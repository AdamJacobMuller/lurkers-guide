<pre> Carl Cantarella &lt;105030.3700@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; In "Falling Toward Apotheosis" there is an outright assassination
&gt; of another of their Ambassadors, so wouldn't it stand to reason
&gt; that NOW the Vorlons would *absolutely* destroy the B5 Station
&gt; because of this latest act by the humans??

      Of course, at the moment, the vorlons are a little busy...but
given time, yes, they would do exactly that.

                                                                  jms
