<pre> Elyse M. Grasso &lt;70302.3304@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Are we shifting from hands to eyes as a theme?
&gt; Does he have a name, or is he so swallowed up in his identity as
&gt; a palace functionary that he doesn't need one? "Who are you?"
&gt; "Who are you?"
&gt; "How did I get here?"
&gt; "Why am I here?
&gt; "Well, that is the question, isn't it?"

      Yes, the last piece there is kind of the key, isn't it?

      I've always kept the minister just that, no name, for the
reasons you cite.  This is someone wh's a survivor, who bends with the
wind, and somehow keeps going by not being noticed, or taken seriously.

      And yes, this season I was noticing that eyes have become a
predominant image, from Lyta to the shadows to Lorien to some stuff
coming in the next few episodes...funny, how this stuff creeps up on
you.

                                                                  jms
