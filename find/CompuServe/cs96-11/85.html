<pre> Robin L. Small &lt;76640.2012@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; will the show and/or the characters be going through something
&gt; like that, where the tensions of the shadow war (both inside and
&gt; out) come to a dramatic confrontation, emerging into the
&gt; realization of hope??

      I'd say that's about right.

                                                                  jms
