<pre> Daniel F. Evan &lt;104377.1433@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Perhaps a no LOTR reference rule is in order?

       No, that wouldn't really be practical.  If someone wants to
*compare* it with LoTR, a compare and contrast thing, that's something
I don't have a problem with...to be even included in the same breath
with LoTR is a great compliment.  It's the notion that something was
*adapted* from that, or some other work, that sometimes drives me
crazy...but I wouldn't wish to set that forth as a rule...the rules are
only as absolutely necessary, not for this sort of thing.

                                                                  jms
