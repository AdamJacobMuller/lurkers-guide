<H2>jms &amp; co at LosCon (LA)</H2>
<h3>Date: 27 Nov 1996 20:10:39 -0700</h3>
<pre>      Just an advisory: this Thanksgiving Sunday, there will be a 2
hour B5 presentation at LosCon, the annual fan-run convention put on by
LASFS (usual attendence about 1000).  The presentation/panel is slated
for 2:30-4:30 in the biggest room they have.  I'll do the first hour,
then the second hour will have our conceptual consultant Harlan
Ellison, producer John Copeland, and co-producer George Johnsen joining
in.  (There's a possibility Peter Jurasik may show up, but that's
unconfirmed at this point.)

      We'll have the very first showing of the rough cut of season 4
bloopers, scenes from several unaired episodes, a music video or two,
and of course the usual dog-and-pony show that has become the biggest
draw at each year's LosCon.

      Because this tends to be a big event, you may want to be sure to
show up a bit early, to get a seat...they vanish REAL fast.

      The convention is taking place at the Burbank Airport Hilton,
just abaft from the Burbank Airport, natch.

      LosCon, as a fan convention, is a lot of fun, and there's
generally a lot of good stuff going on all 3 days as well.  If you
haven't been to a con before, this is a good one on which to cut your
teeth.

                                                                  jms
