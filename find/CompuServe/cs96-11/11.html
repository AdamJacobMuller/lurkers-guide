<pre> Meryl Yourish &lt;103470.2703@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Did Anna have a Keeper?
&gt; Was that the epidermal scarring?
&gt; Was she real, or was she Memorex?
&gt; Was this the end of John and Delenn?
&gt; What did Sheridan ask Garibaldi to do?
&gt; And what was the fourth part of the post you put on Usenet months
&gt; ago, when you finally broke down and gave us a synopsis of the
&gt; episode? Now that their plan to subvert him has failed, we may
&gt; find out more, eh? Then again, we don't really know what a Vorlon
&gt; looks like, do we?

      Thank you.  You're most kind.

      Funny, on the line about "started watching B5 waiting for it to
impress me."  I've heard much the same from many others.  I think we've
all been burned so many times by SF shows that we had a real burden
here to prove what we could do, and how we would do it.  You kinda
don't want to have your heart broken anymore.  I'm glad we were able to
come through.  It's a show I'm very proud of.

                                                                  jms
