      What kinda bugged me was that, after having made the change,
there were a number of people -- presumably associated with Foundation
 -- who were running around the nets and saying that the efx were going
to be terrible, or there wouldn't BE any efx...trying to poison the
well.  But as always, we never do anything unless we think it'll be an
improvement, and the new season shows that.

                                                                  jms
