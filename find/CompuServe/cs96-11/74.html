      Thanks.  This one's a favorite of mine as well.  On the
Garibaldi scene, it was shot fairly conventionally, but as we got into
editing, I said, "Let's do something we don't normally do, let's try a
visual approach that's not usually part of SF shows."  So we put that
sequence together.  Again, my feeling is, break your format once in a
while or get stuck in a rut.  Take chances.  The worst that'll happen
is that you'll fail.

      It's a lovely episode.

                                                                  jms
