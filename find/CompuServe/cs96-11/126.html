<pre> Darran Williams &lt;101656.2143@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is this a prelude to WB cancelling the show at the end of this
&gt; season, and if so why are they so interested in a Babylon 5
&gt; spin-off if they have concerns over a fifth year of Babylon 5 ?

       That's the whole point.  That interview was conducted fresh on
the heels of renewal, and we were getting mixed signals from WB (still
are, actually), and different people were telling people different
things.  It's subsequent to that interview -- remember, there's a LOT
of lead time on these magazines -- that the ratings began to come in,
and WB began initiating talks about a fifth season, and the sequel. 
You don't do a sequel unless the show is doing well.

                                                                  jms
