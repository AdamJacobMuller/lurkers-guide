<pre> Rebecca Eschliman &lt;76072.2345@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Are we simply adding to the "holography" of the B5 experience by
&gt; adding our own layers, or was this parallel actually
&gt; predetermined in the "magic plan?"

      Certainly he came to care about us more than the vorlons
intended.

                                                                  jms
