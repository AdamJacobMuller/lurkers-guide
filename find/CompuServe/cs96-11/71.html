<pre> Toni Muller &lt;75223.1575@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; And, "Can you believe this is on TV?
&gt; It's so much better than anything else?"

      Thanks.  I hope, and sometimes allow myself to think, that
you're right. This show is going to be around for a long, long time,
and I think it's going to be remembered and talked about.  It's a great
experiment, and my only regret is that its like will almost certainly
not come my way again.

                                                                  jms
