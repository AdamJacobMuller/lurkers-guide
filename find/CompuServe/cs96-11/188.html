<H2>JMS: season 4 = arc end?</H2>
<h3>Date: 20 Nov 1996 18:49:45 -0700</h3>
<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Is B5 going to become a franchise, and in what way did they talk
&gt; to you about this? A 5th season of B5 with mostly stand-alone
&gt; episodes? Please, could you enlighten this matter a little for us?

       Once again...nothing is known.  Some folks at WB when we got
renewed said there'd be five, some said four; come of the cast heard
four, and repeated four...the interviews you're seeing now were
actually done a long time ago, given lead times.

       If you're confused, it's because there IS no answer at this
time.  As I said last year at this time, and the year before at this
time, and the year before that...nothing is ever known at this point
until around February or a bit later.  They've initiated some
discussions about the fifth year, as the ratings have continued to
improve, but nothing is set either way.

       If I knew, for certain, I would tell you.  But I can't tell you
until WB makes its final decision.  That hasn't happened yet.

                                                                  jms
