<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; i have to ask you, what is your opinion of bob dole and all the
&gt; stuff he had to say about hollywood?

      Television is a convenient target, nothing more.  In this
respect, and some others, Dole has his head up his ass.  When you don't
have anything else to offer, attack Hollywood.

                                                                  jms
