<pre> Kevin P. Kenney &lt;104102.352@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Wasn't Foundation part of this setup?
&gt; Or did they loophole it due to duress around the time of the
&gt; layoffs? And if the Turner movies happen (Stephen said they would
&gt; at the Pasadena con) are they outside or inside these deals?

       The Turner deals are currently in discussion; and there are
options exercised at the discretion of the producers, not contracts per
se.

                                                                  jms
