<H2>Day &amp; Night on B5</H2>

<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Have you developed any affinity towards science fiction/space now
&gt; that you have written/produced an epic like B5 ? When B5 is over (
&gt; a very sad day indeed ), and you go onto other projects, will
&gt; they be science fiction/space oriented as well ? Does this mean B5
&gt; has a sense of day and night ? And why was Sheridan so interested
&gt; in the wrong door when he was told, 'no it's not that one, it's
&gt; over here' ? Are you ever going to release the notes/revisions you
&gt; have been taking on B5 since 1986 ?

      Actually, I was an SF fan *long* before I ever did Murder, She
Wrote.

      And yes, there's a day/night cycle on B5, it seems appropriate.

                                                                  jms
