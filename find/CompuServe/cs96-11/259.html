<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; I wonder if maybe we'll be seeing it again someday?

       Remember, though, that the alien healing device isn't a
cure-all; to save one person's life, it takes the equal life force of
another.  It was used as a capital punishment device.  So somebody'd
have to die for that to happen...and even then, it doesn't cure
everything.

                                                                  jms
