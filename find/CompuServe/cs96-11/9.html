<pre> Rick Sharon &lt;76416.2213@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Now, any chance you could broadcast ALL of season 4 one night
&gt; this week??

      Thanks.  The details are everything, in a show like this, and
it's great when they're appreciated.

      As for season one...we learned last week that when the show is
finally over, TNT will be stripping the show, starting with the pilot
straight through all the seasons.  Stripping means airing every day, 5
days a week.  I think it'll be great.

                                                                  jms
