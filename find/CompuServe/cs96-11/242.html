<pre> T.P. Chai &lt;104674.3064@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Joe, did the part of Kosh that remained inside Sheridan still had
&gt; its own will? was it consulted by John and Lorien regarding what
&gt; there were going to do, or did J &amp; L use what's remained of Kosh?

      I'd say it was aware of this, yes...and you can hear just a
trace of its voice just before it emerges.

                                                                  jms
