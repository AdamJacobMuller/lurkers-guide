       Thank you.  I can only hope that you are proven right by time,
and that the Nobel committee hears about it....

       As for answers...since I have none to give, I can't shove them
down anyone's throats.  And if I did have them, they'd only be *my*
answers, not anybody else's, so again, there's no point.

       I'm a big believer in the power of critical thinking; don't
just have an opinion, have an *informed* opinion, and challenge it
yourself, be rigorous.  Even if you come back to the same opinion
later, at least you will now be able to defend or explain your view
rationally.

                                                                  jms
