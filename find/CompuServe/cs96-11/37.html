<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;75063.3305@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; One question: Do I take it that you're going to hold off a while
&gt; before telling us how Sheridan and Morden survived? When can we
&gt; expect some sort of answer as to how Sheridan managed to survive
&gt; so intact?

      Thanks.  I'll string out the Sheridan info for a while; as for
Morden, as he said, his associates can repair flesh, replace flesh
(though where they got replacements from is something I don't want to
know)....

      It's definitely a packed episode.  I still find myself realizing
that the end of act one feels like two acts.  And the next three are
every bit as intense, if not moreso.  I love it....

                                                                  jms
