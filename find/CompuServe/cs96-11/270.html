<H2>BACK TO RERUNS BUT WOW</H2>
<h3>Date: 29 Nov 1996 02:09:00 -0700</h3>
<pre> Randy Upshaw &lt;75464.1275@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; When does the rest of this season continue?

"I have complained in the past about what I thought was a slow moving
story but I now feel like we are at warp 9. No wasted eps in the last
batch."

      Told you.

      Now next time maybe you'll believe me.

      And finish your broccoli.  And sit up straight at the table. 
And stop playing with your silverware, it's always funny until someone
gets hurt....

                                                                  jms
