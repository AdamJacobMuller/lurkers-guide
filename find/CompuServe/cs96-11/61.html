<pre> Joe Salemi [ZD Net] &lt;72631.23@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; So, now that we've seen most (maybe all?) of Londo's dream come
&gt; to pass, how's Peter feel about the trip from there to here? Still
&gt; astonished?

      He's pleased, let's put it that way.

                                                                  jms
