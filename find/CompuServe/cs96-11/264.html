<pre> Art W. Sullivan &lt;104630.1315@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; When Kosh told Sheridan, that if he went to Zha'ha'dum he would
&gt; die, was that just a comment on the odds of going there and
&gt; comming our alive, or do the Vorlons have precognition, like
&gt; Londo's dreams about his own death? Does that cost a station any
&gt; more money or can they show it as often as they want?

      It was a statement of fact, one way or another.

                                                                  jms
