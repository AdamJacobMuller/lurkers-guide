<pre> Kevin P. Kenney &lt;104102.352@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; So the light beams streaming from Lyta to Kosh 2 as 'he' leaves
&gt; were done with cel animation then?

      No, the streams were done on a flint, and there were not two
takes edited together, there was just the one continuous take.

                                                                  jms
