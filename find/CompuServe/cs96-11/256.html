       No, it was just relief, letting her guard down, allowing
herself to feel, which she hadn't done much before this.  There's no
romantic interest there.  You can have situations where men and women
work together, and can care about one another, without it turning into
more than that.

       Men seem to understand this less often than women.

                                                                  jms
