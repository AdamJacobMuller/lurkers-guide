<pre> gopher &lt;75410.177@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is my logic faulty?
&gt; Can you clear this up for me?

       I've worked out the details for 1,000 years in either direction
for the B5 storyline in general, and in specific for 100 years in
either direction; there's no chance of anything getting watered down no
matter what happens...there's enough story there for several novels. 
And WB is currently very interested in the side-story/sequel series
that I've mentioned from the beginning is a possibility.

                                                                  jms
