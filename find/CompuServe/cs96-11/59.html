<pre> O. C. Alexander &lt;72623.3472@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; By the way, would it be fair to suggest that in some ways, Justin
&gt; was for the Shadows what Sebastian was for the Vorlons?

      Thanks.  And yeah, it's fun and interesting to see Londo now
having to deal with being in a sense on the same side as Sheridan, but
for vastly different reasons.

                                                                  jms
