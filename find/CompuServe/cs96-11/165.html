<pre> Bernard F. Dowdy, J &lt;76550.347@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; What do the "C" on the Churchill and the "M" on the Roanoke stand
&gt; for? Could they perhaps represent destroyer squadrons?

       Probably.  I'll have to go back and check the notes on that.

                                                                  jms
