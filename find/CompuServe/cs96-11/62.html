      Ambassadors have been learning as they've gone along; I took the
notion that the higher ups didn't have that much contact with humans,
so their grasp of english was halting at best, but over 4 years,
they've gotten better.  The grunts/lower echelons, though, are still
marginal at best.

                                                                  jms
