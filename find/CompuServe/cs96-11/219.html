<pre> gopher &lt;75410.177@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; 1) Are the Shadows motives really (at least) what we've learned
&gt; so far (chaos, evolution, what do you want)? 2) Are the Vorlons
&gt; motives really (at least) what we've learned so far (order,
&gt; evolution, who are you)? 3) Did the Vorlons actually destroy the
&gt; planet mentioned in Summoning? 4) Do the Vorlons really want to
&gt; wipe out all the worlds touched by the Shadows, and ultimately
&gt; eliminate the Shadows all together? 5) Is Lorien really a
&gt; different "thing" than Shadows or Vorlons/Koshs? 6) Is there more
&gt; to the Minbari working caste than we've learned so far?

     Yes to all of them.

                                                                  jms
