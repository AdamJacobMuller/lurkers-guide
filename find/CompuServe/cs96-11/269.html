<pre> Colin Glassey &lt;104224.2227@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Three questions, 1) Do the Vorlons have "wings"?
&gt; 2) What did the original doctor see in the pilot?
&gt; The true form of a Vorlon or the angelic form?
&gt; 3) Why does Morden's request make sense?
&gt; The Shadows are fighting the Vorlons, they know how little
&gt; appreciation the Vorlons are showing for "civilian" deaths, why
&gt; make this request?

      Morden is living in denial...he's afraid, and hoping he's right.
Centauri Prime has more civilians than any other planet or colony hit
so far: three billion people.  The shadows are hoping a figure that
high will daunt even the Vorlons.

      The wings are just how we perceived them, to some extent, though
we did see a hint of wings as the last of Kosh emerged from Sheridan. 
(We also heard the wing flap sound, and the sound of Kosh's voice for
the last time right after Lorien's "Now.")

      Dr. Kyle saw the angelic form...even in its reduced state, it
held itself together enough to maintain that form.

                                                                  jms
