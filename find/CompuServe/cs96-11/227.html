<pre> David Cerreta &lt;72630.3433@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; And everybody finally gets their wish, don't they?
&gt; What is going to happen in the next two weeks?
&gt; How can amassing the largest fleet in history stop the Vorlons
&gt; with their planet killer? How is B5 maintaining operations since
&gt; we have to assume that most trade is interrupted during the war? 
&gt; And, most importantly, who made the salad?

      Thanks...it was an exhausting and difficult episode...but well
worth the work, I think.

                                                                  jms
