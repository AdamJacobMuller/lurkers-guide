<pre> Bob Koslosky &lt;102365.2062@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; The crux of my question is how Sheridan's ships, seemingly
&gt; thousands of years behind the Shadows technologically, are even
&gt; able to "dent" the Shadow ships??

       Bear in mind that the White Stars are partially based on Vorlon
technology, which is similar in strength to the Shadows.  That helps a
lot. Also, other ships can have an influence in sufficient numbers. 
Even a lion can be brought down by a sufficient number of hyenas.  The
idea that higher technology always equals victory didn't help Custer.

                                                                  jms
