<H2>&lt;HotW&gt;: Who's in charge?</H2>
<h3>Date: 11 Nov 1996 02:45:25 -0700</h3>
<pre> Michael Grabois &lt;74737.2600@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; What's the chain of command aboard B5?
&gt; Who's next after her -- who was in command when Ivanova was off
&gt; at Z'ha'dum?

      That would be Major Atumbe, who's been referred to a few times,
but not actually seen much.  And Corwin would also step in if needed.

                                                                  jms
