<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;75063.3305@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; What can I say?
&gt; It dawned on me today that Londo has finally answered the
&gt; question of, "Who are you?" Now that he knows who he is, he knows
&gt; that his answer to "What do you want?"

      Thank you...it's a very emotional episode, and one I like quite
a lot. Those are some great scenes.

                                                                  jms
