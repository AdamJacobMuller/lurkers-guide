<pre> Ray Pelzer &lt;70475.1263@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; One innocuous question: In Z'ha'dum, were those Bruce &amp; Melissa's
&gt; actual wedding photos, or were they special ones you had shot for
&gt; the show? One not-so-innocuous question: is it safe to assume that
&gt; Anna, Morden, and Justin were all roasted in the White Star
&gt; blast? so he'll be doing the season 4 opening credits, eh?

      Yes, we used their actual wedding photos.

      And I did see the Dynamic Druggie Duo on Roseanne (the only time
I've ever watched it).  They were in fine form.

                                                                  jms
