<pre> T.P. Chai &lt;104674.3064@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; BTW did you get those CTS gloves and do they help?

       The director implements the script, as written.  They work with
the actors to bring out subtext and the full understanding of the
scene, but the script is written as it's written, and they know that. 
There's no room here for messing around on set.

       Where our directors tend to shine is in their visual sense.  We
try to bring a certain amount of style to our episodes, and to
encourage our directors to take chances, try things they might not
otherwise get a chance to do.  The more complex the shot, the longer it
takes to set it up, and most TV shows just concentrate on bagging the
shot and moving on.  Others, like X-Files and a growning number of
other shows, including B5, encourage a more filmic look.

       What we want in a director is someone who understands what the
vision is, and is oriented toward executing the text.

       And yes, got the CTS gloves...they're a little soft, and don't
provide the requisite support as well as they might, but I'm giving
them a little more time before I decide that completely.

                                                                  jms
