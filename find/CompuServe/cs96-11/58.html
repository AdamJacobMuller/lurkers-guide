<pre> Colin Glassey &lt;104224.2227@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Was there a note of humanity in his lines this time?

      Thanks.  RE: the opening...exactly.  The B5 story is told from
everyone's point of view, and they're all a part of it, so the opening
now reflects that.  And it gives me the chance to do an opening that's
sort of a prose poem, which is a nice touch.

                                                                  jms
