<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;75063.3305@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Since Ivanova (and Delenn, and the rest, I assume) have resigned
&gt; themselves to Sheridan's death, has anyone bothered to try to
&gt; contact his family and let them know of his fate? Or is this
&gt; something they wouldn't want to get out to the "other side"
&gt; (although I don't see how they can avoid it if all of the
&gt; ambassadors heard the same rumors)?

      That's what Franklin was doing, gathering his possessions with
the intent of getting word to Sheridan's family.

                                                                  jms
