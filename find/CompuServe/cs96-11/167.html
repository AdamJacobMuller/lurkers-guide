<h3>Date: 18 Nov 1996 18:35:09 -0700</h3>
<pre> Robin L. Small &lt;76640.2012@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; will that be explored with Sheridan?
&gt; my question is: Will that part of sheridan's character be
&gt; explored in S5?

       You have to understand that big plot questions like this I
don't answer.  If I were to answer that with "yes," then what's the
point of making the show?  There's no surprises left.

                                                                  jms
