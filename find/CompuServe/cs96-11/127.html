<pre> Chad Underkoffler &lt;102512.1310@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Have you ever read (i think it's called) PRODUCIBLE
&gt; INTERPRETATIONS by Rob Hume and [somebody]? Is this the sort of
&gt; thing you do each day as producer? Isn't that how Dark Shadows
&gt; started, or am I confused?

       No, you're right, you couldn't do those characters with CGI,
it'd have to be prosthetics, or cripple the performance aspect.

                                                                  jms
