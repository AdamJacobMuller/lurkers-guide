       In 2261, nobody much worries about categorizing people as one
thing or another...some can move in and out of various kinds of
relationships and no one thinks of it one way or another.  There is no
political agenda here, or saying "you are this, and if you do that,
you're not this anymore," or conversion, or anything of the sort.

       One can only wish that were more true today.

                                                                  jms
