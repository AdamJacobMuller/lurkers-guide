      Yeah, I know...I went through the same thing.  Much
apologizings.  The server, DirectNet, was blown out by 2,000 or so hits
at the same time, and they (stupidly) hadn't been prepared to face that
many when they approached us and told us we could do this.  I'm
*extremely* annoyed at this, and we're going to take some serious steps
to correct this and make sure it never, ever, EVER happens again.

                                                                  jms
