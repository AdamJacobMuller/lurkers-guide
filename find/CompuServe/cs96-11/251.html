<pre> Richard M. Perry &lt;76461.2737@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; When Kosh said that there were still few, did he mean few who
&gt; understand? You've brought up the first rule of the fanatic a
&gt; couple of times, did Sinclair teach this to Kosh in the hope that
&gt; he would be able to bring the other Vorlons around to that
&gt; understanding? Maybe in the hope that the war wouldn't escalate to
&gt; blowing up planets as well? Did Kosh (and his cohorts) give the
&gt; Vorlon technology so that our heroes could register something if
&gt; the other Vorlons were to escalate the war to the point they did? 
&gt; Another thing that caught my attention, especially with Lorien
&gt; coming back with Sheridan, was one of the questions he asked
&gt; Sheridan; "Do you mind if I share your fire", exactly which fire
&gt; did he mean? Was Lorien refering to the fire on the ground, or the
&gt; fire inside of John, or both? Why do I get the feeling that
&gt; Garibaldi had a return visit to a certain place on Mars? Or
&gt; somewhere with the equipment like that used there? "Do you know
&gt; who I am"; who are you, why are you, what do you want?

       Suffice to say that Kosh was utterly correct about the sword,
and we'll be hearing this again soon.

                                                                  jms
