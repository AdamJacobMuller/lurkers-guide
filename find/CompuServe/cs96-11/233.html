<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Just had to say something, you know?
&gt; Not to mention the fact that I was getting it right back -- "You
&gt; mean you actually *liked* that move? Couldn't you see all the
&gt; stuff that was wrong with it?"

       Oh, no...no, no...you didn't offend anybody, I was only
supporting your argument, and your right to feel any way you choose
about an episode.
