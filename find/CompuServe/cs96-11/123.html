<pre> Chad Underkoffler &lt;102512.1310@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; In your capacity as an executive producer of one of the most
&gt; innovative shows on TV, do you think a miniseries (or set of
&gt; miniseries) is technically possible for Neil Gaiman's SNADMAN, or
&gt; is SANDMAN by virtue of it's construction insanely difficult to
&gt; bring to the screen? What's that?
&gt; You'd like to show me your bat?
&gt; I'll just sit over here, okay, George?

      I think it'd be eminently do-able.  And I'd love to do it if
Neil doesn't.
