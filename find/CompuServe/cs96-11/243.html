<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;75063.3305@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; And what exactly did Lorien mean by "the last of Kosh, and some
&gt; of him and some of me"? Was the energy/being that ripped out of
&gt; Sheridan's chest not *just* Kosh? Was it part of all three of
&gt; them? Did Lorien also have to use some of his energy to keep the
&gt; piece of Kosh alive long enough to battle the Vorlon Ambassador? 
&gt; May I ask if we'll see any rebel EA ships in that fleet? But what?
&gt; And who in their right mind thinks she'll ever give up that ring
&gt; for a "better" one someday? How will he react to that ring on her
&gt; finger and her explanation of what it means? Andreas has to wear a
&gt; patch for the rest of the run and you *still* wanna punish him?

      Thanks, and I agree with all your picks on the scenes.  It came
out very nicely...a good one to end this batch on.  Thanks again.

                                                                  jms
