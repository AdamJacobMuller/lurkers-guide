<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;75063.3305@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Will we ever see Kosh again?
&gt; What will John do?

      Yep, all trace of Kosh is gone.  He/it will never be seen again,
in any form, exempting flashbacks, of which none are currently planned.

                                                                  jms
