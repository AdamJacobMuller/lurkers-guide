<H2>Audio Note from jms</H2>
<h3>Date: 23 Nov 1996 18:19:49 -0700</h3>
<pre>      Just a little thought in your general direction....

      After spending all Monday doing the audio mix mix on 404,
"Falling Toward Apotheosis," which is normal, we did all but 7 minutes
of that episode.

      George Johnsen, John Copeland and I spent from about 7 p.m.
Wednesday night until 2:30 a.m. Thursday morning doing the audio mix on
those little seven minutes.

      So for that episode, you may want to make friends with somebody
with a really good surround sound system.

      Just a thought.

                                                                  jms
