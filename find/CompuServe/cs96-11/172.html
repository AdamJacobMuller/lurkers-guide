<pre> Justin Withers &lt;101650.3373@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; But I have to ask: are they really (as seen in the preview) going
&gt; to try to kill the big, mean, nasty Vorlon Ambassador???

       You'll have to wait 7 days to find out.  But suffice to say
things take quite a turn....

       And thanks.
