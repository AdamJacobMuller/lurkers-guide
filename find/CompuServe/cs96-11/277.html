<pre> Michael R. Brehmer &lt;75303.2242@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; In writing your scripts, do you have a conversation with each
&gt; character and he/she tells you what's happening; or do you see
&gt; the action the character is in from their point of view; or do
&gt; you see the action much as the camera sees it from a third person
&gt; point of view, but focusing on that character?

      I see the episode in my mind the same way it's seen by viewers. 
I watch it from the camera's point of view.  It's just once in a while,
as I'm watching it, that one of the characters will lean into camera,
bang on the side of it, and say "Listen, shmuck, you're not doing this
right."

                                                                  jms
