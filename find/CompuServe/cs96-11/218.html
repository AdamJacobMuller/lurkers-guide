<pre> Meryl Yourish &lt;103470.2703@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; What is his purpose?
&gt; Is he good or evil?
&gt; Have you ever read Bambi?

      Wow...I hardly know what to say.  You work this hard on a show,
and you hope that what you're doing gets noticed for what it is.  You
hope people will understand.  Thanks for, in one message, making the
journey worth the effort.

                                                                  jms
