<H2>4 or 5? Be HONEST, jms</H2>

<pre> gopher &lt;75410.177@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; So can you at least be honest with us about how you are currently
&gt; writing the episodes for season 4? with the intention of ending it
&gt; in 4 or 5 years?

      I have been honest, and remain so.  I have said, repeatedly,
that at this point WB does not know.  Different departments have said
different things, all of them mutally contradictory.  At one time it
sounded like that might be a possibility, and some of the cast talked
about this at the time; that was before ratings started coming in on
the final 5 and the new eps, which have been extremely strong and
continuing to build.  I can say that WB has, itself, initiated
discussions about a fifth season several times over just the last few
weeks.

      What I'm doing is keeping my options flexible...the way it's
being written now is such that it allows me to flip either way. 
There's a certain built-in drop-dead point in that structure, but that
isn't near yet.

      This is what I've been saying all along.  I have been extremely
forthcoming about this, telling as much as *I* know at this point.  So
I do somewhat resent your suggesting that I do what I am doing, and
have been doing from day one.

                                                                  jms
