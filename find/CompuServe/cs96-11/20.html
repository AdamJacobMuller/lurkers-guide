<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Joe, who decides what musical scores go into each episode?
&gt; or does it work that way?

      We contract with Christopher Franke for the full season, and he
provides all music cues.  We can't take outside stuff, it all has to be
work for hire.

                                                                  jms
