<pre> Scott Baker &lt;76072.1744@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; So is it safe to assume that the third age of mankind is wrapped
&gt; up in this somehow? As I write this, I begin to wonder, are we
&gt; seeing to some degree your own thoughts and/or strugles with
&gt; divinity/God/existance, or have you tried to keep those out of
&gt; this?

      I don't know if any of it is so much my thoughts on these areas,
as the questions I think we all have to look at.  My thoughts on their
own wouldn't light up a cheap flashlight.

                                                                  jms
