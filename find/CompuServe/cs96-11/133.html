      I didn't go to Oxford, and I can't read Greek.  I went to 3
junior colleges in small towns, and one college, San Diego State
University.  And I'm doing fairly decent with English when I try, but
except for a smattering of German, forget the rest.

      Where you grew up or went to school is no reason not to go out
and find the great wealth of material waiting for you at your local
library.

      Nor is there anything wrong with LoTR being a bridge to other
works... provided one actually *drives across* that bridge....

                                                                  jms
