<pre> Anne Strauss-Wiede &lt;76614.2621@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Any coincidence between how the eyes appeared to Ivonova, et al
&gt; and that when the Vorlonn appeared to Sheriden that he came as
&gt; his father?

      I figured that they would both tend to use a patriarchal
influence, which would tie into so many races having that system.

                                                                  jms
