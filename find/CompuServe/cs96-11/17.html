<h3>Date: 03 Nov 1996 01:51:22 -0700</h3>
<pre> Joe Salemi [ZD Net] &lt;72631.23@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; My question is one I haven't seen asked yet -- what about Morden?
&gt; Is he now an ex-Morden?
&gt; For that matter, is Justin an 'ex' as well?

      What about Morden?  Oh, wait about 7 days, you'll find out.

      And thanks.

                                                                  jms
