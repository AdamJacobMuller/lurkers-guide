<H2>Episodes are shorter?</H2>
<h3>Date: 13 Nov 1996 18:36:54 -0700</h3>
<pre> S J NICHOLSON &lt;76574.1663@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Why did this episode only last 5 minutes?
&gt; is this going to keep happening...?

       Hey, could be worse, the next one is only three minutes
long....

                                                                  jms
