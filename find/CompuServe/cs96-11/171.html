<pre>{original post had no questions}

       Thanks...I couldn't let folks go without an autograph, and when
I saw they were going to close it down, I had to jump in.

       And that was a *very* nasty gag from Andreas...and I intend to
pay him back bigtime.

       Wait until he sees the script where G'Kar is transformed into a
chicken for one episode.

                                                                  jms
