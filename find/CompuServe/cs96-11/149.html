<pre> Paul Hachey &lt;76625.2644@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; when did Delenn's heart "cross the line"?
&gt; Beings friends first is wonderfully romantic, to quote James
&gt; Stewart in Shenandoah "Yes, I know you love my daughter but do
&gt; you LIKE her?" All rambling aside, when was - to you - the
&gt; galvanizing moment for her?

      I don't think Minbari galvanize in quite the same way...with
them, I think it's more a gradual, growing relationship, and as many
do, there's just one day when the closeness crosses a point without you
almost being aware of it...and there it is.

                                                                  jms
