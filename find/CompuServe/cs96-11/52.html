<pre> Michael Grabois &lt;74737.2600@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Joe-- You've probably read this already, but do you know if Bruce
&gt; and Jerry will still be going to the launch, now that it's been
&gt; delayed?

      Heard about it...don't know how the current schedule is with
them.

                                                                  jms
