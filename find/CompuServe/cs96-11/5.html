<pre>{original post had no questions}

      Kevin: by reposting this information in any form whatsoever, you
have contributed grief to my life.  The stage was flooded with phone
calls while I was at the editing bays about this.

      There is this crummy logic in internetdom which says, "since
information is power, my status can increase the faster I can get info
out to others."

      This kind of rumor is hurtful.  It causes me grief in running it
down; it tied up the switchboard at work; it harrassed many people at
work.

      Understand this absolutely clearly: if anything ever does
happen, I have people at the stage who will post specific and precise
information.  If ever you see a rumor about this, you know *instantly*
that it's not true, because if it were true, it would come instantly
from those involved, and you wouldn't have to HEAR it from any other
source.

      The original poster was bad enough; reposting gossip, rumors or
other nonsense is just as bad.  You should never have posted it in the
first place; many people cited your message as the reason they were
tying up our switchboard.

      Never, ever do this to me again.

      Am I perfectly, crystal clear?

                                                                  jms
