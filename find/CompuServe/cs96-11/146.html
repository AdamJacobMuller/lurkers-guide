<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;75063.3305@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Garibaldi?"
&gt; that she was speaking in Minbari (ala the WWII movies of which
&gt; you spoke earlier)? Or do the minbari Rangers learn English/Human
&gt; as part of their training?

      She was speaking Minbari.

      That's my story and I'm sticking to it.

                                                                  jms
