<H2>B5 Bootleg question</H2>
<h3>Date: 13 Nov 1996 20:12:28 -0700</h3>
<pre> Glen Guenther &lt;71163.75@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; It's an AIDS benefit held by some local comic shops but they're
&gt; going to have some dealer booths which will have who-knows-what? 
&gt; If I see someone there selling bootleg B5 stuff (like they did at
&gt; the last local convention I attended) what, if anything, should I
&gt; do about it.? I know the owner of the main shop sponsoring the
&gt; convention so I can probably get a name and address for any of
&gt; the dealers but is there anything else I can do that would help? 
&gt; Do you know who I could write to at WB to urge them to release B5
&gt; in 1 or more of these formats?

      You must go to the convention operators and explain to them that
by allowing these bootleg tapes to be sold, they are violating
copyright laws and risk being acted against legally by WB.  They have
an obligation to ensure that pirated material is not sold at their
conventions, and if they will not enforce it voluntarily, WB will hold
them responsible, and in some cases, have already done this at
conventions.

      If you see this going on, and it's happening at the time, send
email to ken_parks@warnerbros.com and we'll take it from there.
