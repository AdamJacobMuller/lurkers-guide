<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Are the effects the same or different in some respects?

      Basically, if you're told to look for a difference, you'll see
one.  I got a couple of emails saying that a couple of specific
Centauri Prime shots weren't as good as the old ones...then pointed out
that the ones they singled out WERE the old ones.

      As for the Planet Killer, we bring it a little closer each time.

      Virtually all the designs are right out of the computer files,
so they're identical to what's been done before, using the same system
(or slightly better) and most of the same people.

                                                                  jms
