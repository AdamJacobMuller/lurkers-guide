<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Are you getting soft on us&lt;g&gt;, or was there a reason to give us
&gt; the information here?

      To not do so would've been vastly unfair.  And it nicely
replaces one mystery, is or isn't he, with "who the heck is THAT?"

                                                                  jms
