<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Is this the intent?
&gt; Or, are we so much into the characters at this point that you
&gt; just gotta "join in when you join in" and do your best to catch
&gt; up?

      I dunno...I hear frequently from people who've joined the show
at much later points, and after just a couple of eps, are pretty much
up to speed. Certainly the recap is designed to help.

                                                                  jms
