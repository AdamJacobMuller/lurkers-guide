<pre> Chad Underkoffler &lt;102512.1310@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is Susan Ivanova a "born" or "genetic" teep, or was she
&gt; "infected" with telepathy due to her close mental contact with
&gt; her mother?

       It's genetic, you can't "catch" it from someone.

                                                                  jms
