<pre> Tom Knudsen &lt;72347.1626@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; So, is it possible that Warner Brothers would make a sort of
&gt; trade? Would they give you the sequel, which they CAN show on the
&gt; network, but in turn make you end the original series after 4
&gt; seasons?

      Since your question embodies a complexity of thought I have yet
to see from corporate WB, I very much doubt that will be a problem. 
Further, there are NO plans or intents for the sequel, if it becomes a
reality, to go to the WB network.

                                                                  jms
