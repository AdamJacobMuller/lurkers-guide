<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;75063.3305@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Didn't want another episode like what happened with Delenn's
&gt; dress, eh?

      I never make the same mistake.

      I just learn how to make new ones.

      (And I'm very pleased with that scene...it's kinda goofy, with
the minister in particular...he's just nuts.  Well, not as much as
Cartagia, obviously....)

                                                                  jms
