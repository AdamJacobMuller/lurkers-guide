<pre> Rebecca Eschliman &lt;76072.2345@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Have you gotten any kind of report yet as to what percentage of
&gt; people logging on to thestation.com are opting for Earthforce,
&gt; Minbari, etc.? If so, did the percentages surprise you in any way?

      Haven't seen that figure yet.

                                                                  jms
