<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; what?
&gt; I'd hope for some cinematic releases based in the B5 galaxy?
&gt; Pretty please?
&gt; Once a year or so?
&gt; Do you have a bitmap of a set of closed doors on the station?
&gt; Either to personnel quarters or to a docking bay, something like
&gt; that? Would you know if any such pictures are available anywhere?

      I don't have any bitmaps per se of the doors, though there is a
door like image on the B5 web page, www.thestation.com based on our
doors (as I recall).

      We may do some TV movies to expand upon the arc, show things we
couldn't show in the series for budget reasons, but nothing cinematic
planned.

                                                                  jms
