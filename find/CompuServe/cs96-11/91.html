<pre> SUSAN F. KIRN &lt;76262.2013@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I was curious to know if you have story approval over these and
&gt; if the are considered B5 *canon* (for want of a better word)?

       In the past, we've tried to keep them canon in the broad
strokes, though in the details things fall out.  The new batch, though,
are being kept much closer to continuity....

                                                                  jms
