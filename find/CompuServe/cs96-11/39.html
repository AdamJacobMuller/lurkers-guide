<pre> Alan Mulvie &lt;100566.1444@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Who/what actually owns the copyright to Babylon 5 and any spin
&gt; offs? Sure you as creator own copyright on the ideas and
&gt; characters, along with the stories you write, while WB have
&gt; copyright on the finished product? Or is it about 234 times more
&gt; complicated than that?

      It's 573 times more complicated than that, but bottom
line...Warner Bros. owns the complete compyright to Babylon 5, lock,
stock and barrel, the same as with any show, as ST is a Paramount
property.  It's the nature of the beast.

                                                                  jms
