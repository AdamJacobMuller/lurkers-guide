<H2>Apologies on CO</H2>
<h3>Date: 25 Nov 1996 21:41:20 -0700</h3>
<pre>      Very quickly...my apologies for the fiasco on thestation.com
tonight. Our server is directnet, and...okay, you accept that at
conventions, they always underestimate us.  They give us too small a
room.  Then our people show up...and it's madness.  Well, same thing
happened here.

      Their conferences run maybe 100 people tops most days, and
that's what they figured here *without asking us*.

      Their memory and system allocations were therefore in that area.

      Just one teensy, weensy little problem: something in excess of
2,000 people showed up.

      And I and others got frozen out of the system, the thing was
delayed 30 minutes, it was chaos, angry phone calls were made from B5
to directnet that fried phone lines....

      Anyway...my apologies to those who showed up and may have been
disappointed.  We've registered our extreme displeasure with
directnet, and are strongly considering changing servers because of
this.

                                                                  jms
