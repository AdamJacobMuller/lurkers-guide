<pre>      Okay, it's time for the usual recitation of email rules.

      1) Please do not send me inquiries about the storyline in
private email. You may think, "Well, it's just me," but at last Neilsen
count there were about 15 million of you out there, and only one of me.
I can't get into lengthy discussions about the plot or storylines in
email.  I end up answering the same questions multiple times, and the
answers go to only one person at a time.  If you have a story question,
ASK IT IN A PUBLIC FORUM, NOT IN EMAIL, so that others can benefit from
the answers.

      2) Please, please, PLEASE do not send me story ideas in email.

      3) Do not send jpgs or anything else that requires downloading;
I was hit by a trojan horse and virus lately, and consequently I have a
very firm no-download policy on anything else coming into me via email.

      4) Private email should be used for things you cannot discuss in
a public forum, or for which confidentiality is needed for other
reasons.  I'm swamped with 500 messages a day...if it doesn't have to
be sent email, please don't do so.

      5) Requests for agent suggestions, or requests to read your
scripts or stories, will be met by stony silence.

      6) We cannot give studio tours, or afford to send out scripts,
or story bibles, or actor photographs.  When the actors do this, bear
in mind that it is a kindness *that comes out of their own pockets*, as
there is no budget from WB to send photos.

      I hate to be as brusque as this, but I'm starting to get
overloaded with email, and an occasional pruning seems necessary.

      Many thanks.

                                                                  jms
