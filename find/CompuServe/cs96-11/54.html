<pre> Scott Baker &lt;76072.1744@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; So does thatmean you've formed the opinion that you have no
&gt; answers, or is the show part of you trying to find answers?

      It means I have some ideas that work for me, but no Answers that
could work for anyone else.  I have rules and guidelines based on what
seems basic ethical behavior...but I'm constantly working to revise
them, and question if they work as well as they might.

      But it all comes down to what was said in Lost Horizon: "Be kind
to one another."

                                                                  jms
