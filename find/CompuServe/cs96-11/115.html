<H2>Women's role in SF &amp; B5</H2>
<h3>Date: 13 Nov 1996 18:43:16 -0700</h3>
<pre> Gayle S. Stever &lt;103202.3163@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; So the show should cater to men's fantasies?
&gt; What about women's fantasies?
&gt; What about women who want to see other women explore something
&gt; BESIDES their sexuality and romantic life? What about women who
&gt; fantasize about leadership, respect, making a difference, being
&gt; their own person?

       "What about women's fantasies?"

       I'm busy.
