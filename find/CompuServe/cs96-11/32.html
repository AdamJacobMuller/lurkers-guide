<pre> Rebecca Eschliman &lt;76072.2345@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I can't imagine carrying around ALL of theses richly-drawn
&gt; characters in the fullness of their stories over such an extended
&gt; time -- are there any words to describe what that feels like for
&gt; you?

"I can't imagine carrying around ALL of theses richly-drawn characters
