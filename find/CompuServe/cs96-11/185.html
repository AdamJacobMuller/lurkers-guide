<pre> Don Berg &lt;74147.1753@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; In the upcoming episode that Steven Furst is directing, does Vir
&gt; not appear? And is the upcoming director "Tony Dow" - the same
&gt; actor who played Leave it to Beaver's Wally Cleaver?

       It seemed a bit much for Stephen to both act and direct in the
same episode, and yes, it's *that* Tony Dow.

                                                                  jms
