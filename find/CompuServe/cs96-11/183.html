<pre> Bob Koslosky &lt;102365.2062@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Even if that Iowa class ship could be telepathically "jammed:,
&gt; what could those Trieme's actually accomplish with spears and
&gt; arrows? If the Shadows are thousands of years advanced of all the
&gt; races except the Vorlons, how are Sheridan's "Trieme"s" able to
&gt; hurt the Shadows at all? So militarily speaking, why haven't the
&gt; Shadows just run ruff shod over Sheridan's brave forces????

       Because up until now, they haven't been out to destroy
everyone, that's not the point...you can't sow chaos if there's no one
around in which to sow that chaos.  And they may have some ideas on how
B5 could be turned to their advantage....

                                                                  jms
