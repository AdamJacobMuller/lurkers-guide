<pre>      Just a quick advisory..I'll be doing an online conference this
coming Monday at the official B5 fanclub site,
http://www.thestation.com ...this is our very first online major
conference, and you're welcome to attend.  The site is open to all,
providing chat features, messages and a station tour, with some areas
set aside just for FC members, and more features coming on line soon.

                                                                  jms
