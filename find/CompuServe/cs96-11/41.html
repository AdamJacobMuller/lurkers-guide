<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Is extra work valuable experience in getting larger parts?
&gt; Is this true?
&gt; Has every extra on B5 completed some sort of "offical acting
&gt; class"?

      I know little of any use about acting.  I don't know if being an
extra helps or not; most extras I know do only that, nothing more, and
if you have no lines, you can't progress.  Acting seminars are
necessary and good, but the high priced exploitive ones are to be
avoided.  Best to have her hook up with a theater and do a lot of that;
most of our actors on the show, guest and regulars, are folks with lots
of theatrical (stage) training and experience.

                                                                  jms
