<pre> Michael R. Brehmer &lt;75303.2242@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; At what point do you come up with the title - before you write
&gt; the episode, during, or at the end? Yeats poem (the title escapes
&gt; me - too many years since college English literature) that refers
&gt; to "shadows" and "slouches toward Bethlehem"? Also, have you ever
&gt; read the book "Slouching Toward Bethlehem" by Joan Didion, circa
&gt; 1968, which, I believe, contains a fragment of the Yeats poem?

      I always have to have the title before I begin writing, since it
sets the whole tone for the episode.  I can labor for hours just coming
up with the right title...other times it just hits me.

      And I've read the Yeats poem...even had G'Kar quote that passage
in "Revelations."

                                                                  jms
