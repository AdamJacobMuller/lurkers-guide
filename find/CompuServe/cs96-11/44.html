<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;75063.3305@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Did you envision the character that way, or did the actor and the
&gt; character merge into something wonderful?

      Innocent and fragile is a good description...and certainly the
dialogue is written that way, and we cast him because he matches that
character.

                                                                  jms
