<pre> Meryl Yourish &lt;103470.2703@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Are those entirely Wayne's eyes?
&gt; Is he wearing contacts, or do you just have the greatest makeup
&gt; artist in the world?

      The eyes have metallic gold contact lenses; you can't see them
as well in the red light, but later, you'll see them better.

                                                                  jms
