<pre> Debra dwnSo &lt;104412.1664@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; What would I have to do to bribe you to tell me?
&gt; As for the father voice, are you trying to make us paranoid and
&gt; wonder if they Eyes may be Kosh?

      Yeah, I almost wouldn't worry too much about the background
stuff; this season starts some new threads that should be pretty easy
for a newbie to jump into.

      Enjoy the ride....
