<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; when will the new cd (soundtrack) come out?
&gt; will corwin get a bigger role, and a spot on the openning
&gt; credits? and, the names of who narrated the openning of season
&gt; four in the order they narrated in?

"when will the new cd (soundtrack) come out?"

      I'm going to be getting the soundtrack in about 10 days from
Chris, so I can listen and approve or give notes.  That's the last
stage; the artwork is done, the liner notes are in, everything's done. 
So it should be fairly quickly thereafter.

"will corwin get a bigger role, and a spot on the openning credits?"

      There are currently no plans for that; the main cast is big
enough as it is.

"and, the names of who narrated the openning of season four in the
order they narrated in?"

      I have to do this from memory, but I think it's Bill, Jeff,
Andreas, Pat, Stephen, Jason, Mira, Peter, Richard, Claudia, Jerry and
Bruce.

                                                                  jms
