<pre> Mike Robison/ WA &amp; FL &lt;71361.1440@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Just one or two shirts?

      The WB stores/catalog generally don't carry items from many of
the shows produced by WB.  Only a very rare few.  And B5 isn't
technically a WB show, it only distributes the show, so I'd say the
odds are slim and none.

                                                                  jms
