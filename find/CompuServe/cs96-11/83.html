<H2>captain's bar in "wolf"</H2>
<h3>Date: 11 Nov 1996 02:38:08 -0700</h3>
<pre> JIM BUSKIRK &lt;70571.2357@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; what more could you ask for?
&gt; "hour of the wolf" will you confirm for the record that the
&gt; captain's bar that fell to the ground fell from Sheridan's chest? 
&gt; or could it have been dropped from the "one moment of perfect
&gt; beauty" 'creature' in "Matters Of Honor"?

      It's not a captain's bar it's a stat bar (gold for command, gold
and silver for command/administrative liaison, red for medical, green
for security), and it's Sheridan's.

                                                                  jms
