<H2>Time to Change?</H2>

<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;75063.3305@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Exactly how much time passed between these two scenes?
&gt; Was something written and/or shot that wasn't fit into the final
&gt; cut?

      No, that's the funny thing...I've seen a number of posts about
how his uniform was changed, but it *wasn't*.  It was exactly the same
outfit right out of the wardrobe closet...not sewn, not cleaned, just
dusted off a bit, by hand, the way he might've upon coming in.  You can
clearly see that the sleeve is still torn as he's up there.

      All I can figure is that the red Z'ha'dum lighting made it look
a lot worse than it was.

                                                                  jms
