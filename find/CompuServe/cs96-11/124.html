<pre> Colin Knowles &lt;72152.201@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; When the Vorlons separate bits of their consciousness, can the
&gt; bits develop individually over time? Do they remained linked to
&gt; the original, or are they essentially separate individuals until
&gt; they merge back with the original? sending only certain elements
&gt; to the host? How am I doing?
&gt; Hot?
&gt; Cold?

      They can't survive for long on their own.
