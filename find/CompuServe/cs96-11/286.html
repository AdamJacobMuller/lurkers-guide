      Actually, the first few used about the same amount of stock as
most of our shows ever did.  And there was a LOT of new stuff...the
Z'ha'dum confrontation with the White Star, the new establishers of
Centuari Prime from space, plus the new ones of the city, and the big
garden areas in "The Summoning" (all those outside sets are virtual),
the shadow overflys in 401, Lorien's "true image" holding up Sheridan,
the underground Z'ha'dum composites, the new B5 establishers, the White
Star fleet coming to B5...there was a LOT of stuff there, it's just
very subtle.

                                                                  jms
