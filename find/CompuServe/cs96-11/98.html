<pre> Timothy C Schell &lt;71174.2414@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is this in the correct order?
&gt; Am I leaving out something?
&gt; Was this the base at Syria Planum or is that another installation
&gt; altogether? I seem to remember Garibaldi referring to
&gt; investigating the Syria Planum base....did he make further
&gt; inquiries or was the story just to coverup how he first
&gt; discovered PsiCorps activities? Was Garibaldi's flirtatiousness
&gt; with Talia genuine or a ploy to keep close to her without
&gt; arousing the mole personality's suspicion?

       Sounds about right.

                                                                  jms
