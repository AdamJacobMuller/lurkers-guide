      Nope.  Because a) WB doesn't think there's a market for B5 on
tape or disk, b) won't let us do it because they have the right to do
it, even though they won't (like the proverbial monkey with its fist
around a nut in a jar, it can't take it out and won't let go), and c)
WB video almost never handles piddly TV stuff, only big-budget,
sure-return movies.

      We'll keep working at it.  Sooner or later, we'll win.

                                                                  jms
