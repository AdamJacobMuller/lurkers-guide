<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Can someone market themselves to develop material specifically
&gt; for the show under those conditions? Its like saying, hey, Im a
&gt; musician and Id like to do some music scores for your show, do
&gt; you like my style, are you interested?

      No, you must understand, we commit for full seasons, not per
episode.

                                                                  jms
