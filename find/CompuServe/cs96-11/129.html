<pre> Bryan Morton &lt;106454.3602@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Okay, I realize you're proabably sick to the back teeth of people
&gt; asking you about the fifth season, but I gotta know - is this
&gt; report true? If so, is there any point in even *having* a fifth
&gt; season, given that one of the show's greatest hooks (that famous
&gt; arc) wouldn't be present?

       I just answered this in another thread....

                                                                  jms
