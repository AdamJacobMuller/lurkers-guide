<H2>Traffic to B5 from Earth</H2>
<h3>Date: 25 Nov 1996 16:54:13 -0700</h3>
<pre> Randall A. Schanze &lt;74724.762@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is trafic between Earth and B5 still open?
&gt; (Well, at least the wife did.) How is it that people like that
&gt; are still coming through the station in the middle of a civil
&gt; war?

       It's difficult and limited, but yes, there's still some travel,
just as one may travel to countries that the US does not recognize
officially or have diplomatic relations with.  How long they continue
to allow this...we'll see.

                                                                  jms
