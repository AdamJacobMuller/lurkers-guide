<pre> Carin Ekeroth &lt;75313.3004@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Why would I choose a marginal position in society?

"My point is that orientation, that who you fall in love with, is not
a matter of choice! Why would I choose a marginal position in society?
I operate very much in the mainstream as a senior executive in a large
multinational corporation and believe me - being openly gay is not the
most career enhancing thing I've ever done by a long shot! It is not
chosen and I don't believe you can switch orientation like changing
socks."

      Ah, but you see, here you are revealing your *own* prejudices. 
The gay community has adopted the "ther is no choice, this is how
you're born" argument for many political and social reasons, some of
them sound and reasonable, some of them less so.

      You say you want to enhance choices, but in that one paragraph
alone you are restricting the choices of others...one can not explore,
one cannot change one way or another, one is locked in for life.  Now,
in many cases, this may be true...but it is not true in all places, at
all times, for all people, and the lack of tolerance for lifestyle
choices you indicate does not speak well for you.

      I have many friends who are gay.  I have many friends who are
bi.  I know women who were involved with men exclusively for most of
their lives, then got involved with women exclusively for a number of
years.  Some are still there, and happy, some have flipped back again.

      The far right uses political agendas to restrict the choice of
other people..."nobody's naturally born gay, it's all teaching, and
it's against god's law," which is nonsense...and I'd hate very much to
see the same politicization going on at the *other* end of the
spectrum, in which there are only gays, and straights, and no room to
maneuver, and anybody else has something wrong with them somewhere.

      You go that way, and you're just exchanging a closet for a
straightjacket.  This, by my lights, is not progress.

                                                                  jms
