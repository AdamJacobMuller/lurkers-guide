<pre> Darran Williams &lt;101656.2143@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is there any further news on the second Babylon 5 soundtrack?

      Chris fell behind due to the press of work...however, the
artwork and liner notes are all finished, and he said this past
Thursday that he'd have the first pass at the new soundtrack in my
hands this coming week for approval and discussion.  So it's getting
there...he just wants it to be done right, and as always, I'd always
prefer it be done *right* than fast.

                                                                  jms
