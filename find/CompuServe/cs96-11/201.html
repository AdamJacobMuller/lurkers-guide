<pre> Chad Underkoffler &lt;102512.1310@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Do the Technomages (or Technomagi, natch) have access to higher
&gt; than Earth Alliance technology? Or is it that their tech is aimed
&gt; at "looking" magical?

      They definitely have access to higher tech, through TMs on other
worlds.
