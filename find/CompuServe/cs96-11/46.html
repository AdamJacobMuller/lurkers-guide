<pre> Scott Baker &lt;76072.1744@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; If, however, we are fully human in our "native" state, that is,
&gt; there is no where to go, then the question of "Who are you?" If
&gt; the Shadows are evil and bad, what happens when the "good" start
&gt; acting like the bad and take their eyes off their Ideal, and
&gt; start striving for what they want? The Vorlons manipulate races
&gt; genetic codes to create telepaths, they manipulate Sheridan to
&gt; put him in a place to head the AOL so that he will wipe the
&gt; Shadows away, and they are so sure that they have answered the
&gt; question "Who are they?" Delenn and Kosh hide the truth from
&gt; Sheridan, don't trust him to be who he is, and then excpect him
&gt; to do what they ask? In trying to stop evil, the Vorlons and
&gt; Minbari have fallen into the oldest trap that evil has, they have
&gt; become what they fought, they have become so busy asking everyone
&gt; else "Who are You?" while they were answering "What do you want?"
&gt; By forgiving one another, and by being forgiven, they can begin
&gt; to answer the question of "Who are they?" What do you think?

      That's an extremely good and cogent analysis.  And you hit the
theme right on the head, one we'll explore in year four with the
Vorlon/Shadow situation...and which was presaged in "Infection," right
in the first season, the first episode shot.  Sinclair says, in the
ultimate moment in that conflict, "You forgot the first rule of the
fanatic: When you become obsessed with the enemy, you *become* the
enemy."  That is what is happening here, with these two and other
parties.

      It all comes together....

                                                                  jms
