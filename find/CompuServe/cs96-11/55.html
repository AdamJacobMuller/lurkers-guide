<pre> Bob Koslosky &lt;102365.2062@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; It appears that trying to contact you via the moderated USENET
&gt; newsgroup on the Internet is too hard to do using COMPUSERVE; but
&gt; I understand from the Lurker's guide that this is still an
&gt; acceptable forum? Did the Shadows, Vorlons and to a lesser extent
&gt; the Minbari hit a technological plateau in those thousand years? 
&gt; So how is Sheridan and company able to "compete" militarily with
&gt; the Shadows (although coming off the short end of a 2-1 kill
&gt; ratio is probably not exactly "competing")?

      Actually, the shadows are *much* older technologically than a
thousand years...that's just what Anna promised Sheridan we could jump
ahead, between 1 and 10,000 years.  They're profoundly older than that.

                                                                  jms
