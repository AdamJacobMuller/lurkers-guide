<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; I thought HoTW was incredible, WHtMG?
&gt; Huh?
&gt; Explain, please?

      Remember that often people will express an opinion as though it
were the fact.  What we like, and what resonates with us, is
subjective.  What you like, you like, and there's no need to defend it
or feel pressured about it.

                                                                  jms
