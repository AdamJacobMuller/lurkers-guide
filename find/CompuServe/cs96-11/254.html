<pre> Rebecca Eschliman &lt;76072.2345@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; ("How big do you think the _____ will get?"
&gt; Will there be any kind of transcript of what went on between
&gt; those who successfully navigated the shoals made available? If so,
&gt; where and how?

       I don't know if it'd be worth transcribing...too much chaos.

                                                                  jms
