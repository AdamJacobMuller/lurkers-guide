<pre> Richard M. Perry &lt;76461.2737@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; There are generally two questions I get that are on this level:
&gt; "Why do you like *that* stuff?" (after answering "yes" to "You
&gt; really like that stuff, don't you?") and "Why are you involved
&gt; with Boy Scouts?" On a somwhat related note, did you happen to get
&gt; the Kingdom Come limited edition slipcover? Whose will be done?

      Exactly.  And the question is phrased to put you on the
defensive when there is *nothing* one needs to be defensive
about...it's "how long have you been beating your wife?"  You have to
redefine the question to something a tad closer to reality.

      Re: the Kingdom Come ltd. edition...no, I didn't know about
that.  Will definitely go out and pick it up next chance I get; that
was one of the few series I read this year, and I liked it a lot.

                                                                  jms
