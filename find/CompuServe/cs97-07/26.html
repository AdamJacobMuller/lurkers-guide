"When you look back and reflect on what you've accomplished down the
road, I hope the reality matches the vision you had when you were
pitching the idea lo those many years ago."

      A few glitches notwithstanding...it *exceeds* the vision.  I'm
happy. It's the main piece that I will end up putting on the mantle to
remind folks I was here.

"Now, when you're done, could you please do a fantasy series, so I can
find a job for the troll in the well at the bottom of the hill near my
barn?  He's irritating the hoses and I think he'll work for scale. . ."
                           ^^^^^

      Irritating the hoses?

      May I suggest, rather than fantasy, perhaps a version of "Enema
Mine."

                                                                  jms
