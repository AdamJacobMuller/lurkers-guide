"Joe could write sa character out of an episode or 4, yet the suits
could insist that the actor be present on the set anyway (or be in
breach of contract)!"

      Nope.  Wouldn't happen.  Has never happened.  Would never
happen.  WB has not even given us a creative *note* in almost 2 years.

      This one's a non-starter.  That would simply not happen.  If
you're not in the script, there's no need for you to be there.

                                                                  jms
