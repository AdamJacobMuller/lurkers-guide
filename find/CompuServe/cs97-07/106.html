"case in point - Claudia's cut-of date was last week - yet Joe claimed
that he had written stories that would have to be re-fitted around
claudia and he didn't have time... but if thats so then he never had
any intention of writing her in - so there is a whole there."

      No, the date is incorrect.  This all happened at Blackpool,
which was over the weekend of July 10th-13th.  The Friday deadline that
we have been discussing was July 11th.  The weekend of the 17th I was
in San Diego, which is when Claudia started talking about this at a
convention elsewhere.

      I could not have been sitting in a hotel pub with her on
Thursday night in Blackpool if I was in San Diego at the time.  All
this went down while we were in the UK.

                                                                  jms
