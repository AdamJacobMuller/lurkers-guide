"all I was really saying is that he should keep the business side  of
the show off of this forum."

      Then you miss two important points.

      1) This came up at Claudia's convention appearance, and the
result has led people to ask questions.  As in, "What the hell's going
on?"

      2) The whole reason I'm *here* is not publicity, but to create
and maintain a dialogue about How Television Is Done and Why Things Are
Done The Way They're Done.  The business side of it has comprised about
60% of the discussion from day one.  To answer questions about all the
other business aspects, but pointedly *not* answer them here, goes
against the reason I'm here, and would imply there's something to hide.

      Besides, last I heard, you didn't define the range of what can
be discussed here, that's up to the sysops.  If it's jake by them, it's
jake by me.  The problem is yours.

                                                                  jms
