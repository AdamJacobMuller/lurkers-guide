<H2>jms in san diego</H2>
<h3>Date: 16 Jul 1997 21:10:29 -0700</h3>
<pre>      Just a quick note to let folks know that I'll be in San Diego
this coming weekend for ComicCon, at the convention center downtown. 
I'll be doing two (fairly identical) major B5 presentations Friday and
Sunday at 11 a.m., and a "spotlight on jms" presentation (whatever the
hell that is) Saturday at 1:30.

      A word to the wise: in the past, these have always been the
largest events held at ComicCon, which has about 25,000 guests on
average.  The room they set aside for B5 stuff tends to hold about 2400
people, so seating is kind of at a premium.  Translation: try and get
there early.

      I'll be bringing the season 4 bloopers, clips from upcoming
shows, some nifty videos, and trailers for the two new B5 TV movies for
TNT.  Also, the official B5 fan club will be making its debut at a
table in the dealer's room this weekend at SDCC, selling some nifty
stuff including bunches of the Agamemnon cap worn by Sheridan in
"Knives."  It's identical to the prop in just about every way.

      See you there.

                                                                  jms
