<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Did you write the episode of Renegade that aired (well...cabled)
&gt; tonight on USA? Or did my ears deceive me?

      I don't write for Renegade, and thus have no information on this
other than what you just told me.

                                                                  jms
