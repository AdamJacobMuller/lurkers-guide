<pre> Catherine Becic &lt;73414.2603@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; In that case, for the newbies, will there be some explanation of
&gt; why Delenn changes looks from In the Beginning to The Gathering
&gt; and then back for the episodes?

      Well, I could run a crawl on the bottom of the screen...or
insert a commercial explaining it...otherwise, I think just letting it
go would be best.

                                                                  jms
