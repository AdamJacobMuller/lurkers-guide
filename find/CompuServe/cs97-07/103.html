<pre> Bruce "Firestorm" S. &lt;72571.1722@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is a creative note kind of like a warning or an order?

      A creative note is often, "Can you clarify this scene a little
so that new viewers will get it?"  That was, I believe, the last
creative note we got, back in episode 2 of year 2.  They're mainly in
the form of story suggestions, rarely if ever a Do It Like This
situation.

                                                                  jms
