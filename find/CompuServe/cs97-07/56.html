      Thanks.  I don't do any convention with a direct link to Trek in
its name, so that would leave Toronto Trek out, despite many friendly
talks with the con organizers.  Bottom line, I get gigged by ST fans
for "poaching," and it just ain't worth the grief I get.

                                                                  jms
