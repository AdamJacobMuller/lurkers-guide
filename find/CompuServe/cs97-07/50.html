<H2>San Diego Con plans?</H2>
<h3>Date: 08 Jul 1997 02:10:02 -0700</h3>
<pre> Michael Grabois &lt;74737.2600@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; What's the difference between the Saturday show and the
&gt; Friday/Sunday ones? And is anyone else from the show scheduled to
&gt; be at the con?

      I don't actually know what the difference is, except that I
think the Friday/Sunday presentations involve the videos, and the
Saturday one *may* just be me running my mouth.  (I just sent a note
asking about this, btw.)

      I think they've learned what other cons have learned: that it's
best to take extraordinary measures to deal with B5 presentations. 
People show up. LOTS of people.  And a cuter and more inherently spiffy
bunch I can't imagine.

                                                                  jms
