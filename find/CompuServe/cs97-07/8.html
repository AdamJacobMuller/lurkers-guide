"I say do that same thing you did when you first had this idea-write
for yourself. Focus on what you want to express. Develop those ideas
you deem important."

      That's the only way I can do this; only way I ever have or ever
will.

"And if you ever need a break, drop by Vegas and share some Corona's,
limes, and a can of salt with me. We can laugh at the world together in
the summer sun, watch some showgirls, and throw some bucks at the
blackjack table."

      I don't drink, don't smoke, don't do drugs, don't gamble...I
write. Sad, innit?

"I'll steer you away from any Tyson boxing matches, though."

      I'm just *waiting* for him to get mad at somebody, and have that
person reel back saying, "Hey, sorry, jeez, don't bite my head off,
man."

                                                                  jms
