<pre> Hugh Kennedy &lt;70042.710@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I seem to remember that your CGI people were able to work in some
&gt; hubble shots as backcloths for some of the earlier scenes? Is
&gt; there any chance of featuring a certain well known piece of Mars
&gt; territory? Its just nice to tell sci-fi averse people, ok - its
&gt; just a story but how can it be purely sci-fi when the backdrops
&gt; are real?

      We do get lots of Mars shots from the Space folks, and those
have been used in the establishing shots this season.

                                                                  jms
