"CC trusts that JMS will do what he can, but feels that things might
be out of his hands and puts the question to Copeland who tells her
(via her agent) that what JMS offered is "Not possible."

      It is not possible only if one wishes to be paid for all 22.

"5.  A deadline is set for CC to get in touch with WB to confirm S5.
According to CC, she was told this by Conaway and not informed via
normal channels (i.e. via agent, manager, WB).  She tries to contact
her agent regarding this but they miss each other over the weekend."

      Ken Parks of WB Business Affairs informed her agent.  I
personally informed her as well.

"JMS says she had a Friday deadline.  CC says she was told Monday by
Conaway and that neither her agent or manager were informed of this
deadline."

      After the Friday deadline passed, Jeff took it upon himself to
try and convince her to go back to the show.  He went to her and said
that if she or her agent contacted WB on Monday, there might be a
chance to patch things up. That was the full extent of it.  Jeff does
not represent the show, and was not asked to convey this to Claudia,
and was acting on his own good will to try and help her out.  It had
nothing to do with deadlines.

                                                                  jms
