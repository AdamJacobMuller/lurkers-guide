<pre> Shawn D. Ratner &lt;73753.175@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is that true?

      It's been discussed with other ideas, but nothing more.

      The Agamemnon caps made their debut at San Diego Comic Con, and
were a huge hit.

                                                                  jms
