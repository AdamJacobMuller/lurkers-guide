"But then I never watched B 5 even if Chekov was on it.  I always
thought of it as a copy of DS9 because DS9 was in the works longer."

      Just to correct: DS9 was not developed until about 1991/1992
(I'll have to go check which one for sure)...B5 was being shown around
town in full pilot-script and artwork form dating back to 1987.

                                                                  jms
