<H2>S5 in the UK?</H2>
<h3>Date: 07 Jul 1997 02:49:23 -0700</h3>
<pre> colin heaps &lt;100622.3610@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Do you think it likely that TNT will be showing S5 in the UK?

      I haven't been apprised of the UK situation in full yet, but
imagine that it'll go through WB as before, not TNT.

                                                                  jms
