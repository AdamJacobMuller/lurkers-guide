<pre> Paul McElligott &lt;70007.3154@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Actually, the show didn't REALLY change hands, did it?
&gt; This was more of a lateral than a punt....true?

      Not really, no...because the two organizations are *affiliated*
but they continue to operate as wholly different companies, and neither
side takes orders from the other.  TNT *actively pursued* both the
reruns (before the companies merged) and the fifth season.  And they
fought like hell to make the deal work.

                                                                  jms
