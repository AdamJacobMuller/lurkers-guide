<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Every character but Ivanova has undergone great changes, I
&gt; presume that her's were to come now with the challenges and
&gt; stresses of the battle with Psi Corp/Earth and her assumption of
&gt; Army of Light command? Will the new character be used, more or
&gt; less, to complete Ivanova's development or will her thread be
&gt; dropped? Will the new character only have a lifespan of nine
&gt; years? Could he be assistant king/commander?

      Whatever you're drinking, you're either not drinking enough of
it or too much of it.
