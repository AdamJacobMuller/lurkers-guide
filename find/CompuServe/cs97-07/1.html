"Considering how they refer to "The Children of VALEN" and don't
bother to mention the name of the WIFE of Valen, I'd say patriarchal."

      Or they pick the more well-known of the two.  We often say "Mick
Jagger's kid" because he's the more well known of the pair.

      Or they could be rather subtly ignoring what they might consider
just a bit of scandal....

                                                                  jms
