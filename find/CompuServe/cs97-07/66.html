"In the back of my mind, I wonder why Claudia, her agent, Joe, and the
WB/TNT folks couldn't sit down together (or conference call, or
whatever) and talk with each other on that final day."

      I did.  That Thursday night, I sat with her for half an hour,
urging her to call her agent, and have her agent call WB.  Didn't
happen.  We never even heard anything from her or her people until
literally 1 week after the deadline for scripts to start coming in.

                                                                  jms
