<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Couldn't you have John Vickery portray a nephew or cousin or even
&gt; a son of Neroon, who also became a ranger?

       We'll keep our eyes out for a way to bring him around again,
same as with Wayne.

                                                                  jms
