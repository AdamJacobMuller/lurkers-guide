<pre> Scott Baker &lt;76072.1744@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Will you be writting all of season 5, or is the remarkable streak
&gt; soon to end?

       No, I have no intention of writing all of S5...I'll probably do
about what I did in S1-2, writing 11-15, with the rest being assigned
out of the arc.  And Neil Gaiman has said he's now in a place where he
can tackle one, so I hope to work out something with him, a story worth
his doing, to make that happen at last.

                                                                  jms
