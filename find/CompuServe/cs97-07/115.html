      Re: Turhan...yeah, everybody on the set yelled at me when we had
to kill off Turhan's character.  He was one of the genuinely sweetest
and nicest persons to come work on the show, and they all fell in love
with him.  If there's EVER a way I can figure out how to bring him
back, I'm up for it.
