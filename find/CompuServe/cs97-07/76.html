<pre> Bancroft Gracey &lt;100532.1747@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt;  -bpg- Uncle-at-Large "....'Great Maker', huh?"

"They wouldn't like it, but they had to let a certain Mrs Roddenberry
set a precedent..."

      1) Majel isn't a series regular, with the contract requirements
thereof.

      2) Nobody messes with the Roddenberrys.

                                                                  jms
