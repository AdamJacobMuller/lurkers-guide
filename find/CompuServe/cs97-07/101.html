<pre> T.P. Chai &lt;104674.3064@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; JMS, 1) will 501/422 have season 4 or 5 title screens?
&gt; 2) since you're shooting S5 straight through, is it going to cost
&gt; less money?

"1) will 501/422 have season 4 or 5 title screens?"

      It will be a season 4 title sequence.

"2) since you're shooting S5 straight through, is it going to cost
less money?"

      No, we're not shooting any differently than we ever do.  We
always start in the Summer, usually July, then have a one week hiatus
midway toward Christmas, then there's the Christmas break, then we come
back in January, and shoot through to the conclusion with one more
one-week hiatus, which are given to keep from burning out the crew. 
TNT will be airing them straight through, without breaks for reruns, so
we're going to have everything done ASAP to meet those deadlines.

                                                                  jms
