<H2>DS9 = Babylon 5</H2>
<h3>Date: 29 Jul 1997 20:51:11 -0700</h3>
<pre>{original post unavailable}

      The show starts the weekend of January 4th on TNT, first with a
newly filmed prequel, "In the Beginning," then the original pilot, then
the next day, Monday, it starts from the very first episode of season
one and goes straight through, Monday through Friday, 5 nights a week,
at 7 p.m. Eastern. The fifth season starts mid-January.

      With the new airings on TNT, we will run through the entire
first 4 years in 18 week cycles, so everyone will have a chance to
catch up and see the whole thing.

      But this thread more properly belongs in the B5 section, so any
further questions should probably go there.

                                                                  jms
