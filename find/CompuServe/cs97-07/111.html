      What smug?

      You said that if I asked people not to talk about it, they would
automatically stop.  I've been on the nets a long time, and that sort
of thing is so unlikely as to engender the response I noted.  Hence my
question.

      As if my saying, "Now, stop that" would work.

      How much power do you think I have?

      The problem isn't what I'm saying, it's your sensitivity over
it.

                                                                  jms
