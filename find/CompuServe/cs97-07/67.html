<pre> Paul McElligott &lt;70007.3154@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Are the actors who played Major Ryan or Captain McDougal being
&gt; considered to replace Claudia? Or would that be telling?

      I'd prefer to put a female in that position, to keep the cast
relatively balanced.  I've actually come up with some very interesting
ideas on this, which are kinda fun...a way to put a lot more conflict
into the inner circle, if you will.

                                                                  jms
