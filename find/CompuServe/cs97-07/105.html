<pre>{original post had no questions}

"JMS was simply not at that fatful alledged meeting between Claudis
and managment (or at least I've never seen him claim to be there) so he
only knows what others have told him about that meeting."

      There was no such meeting.

"Now Claudia was alledgely present at that alledged meeting where they
are alledged to have told her to find another job."

      Again, there was no such meeting.  Claudia was in the UK, at the
same convention I was attending, when all this went down.  And *I* was
the one who told her that she had to have her agent contact WB to tell
them she was in, or they'd withdraw the offer.

      Kinda sticks a pin in that particular balloon....

                                                                  jms
