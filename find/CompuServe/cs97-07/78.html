<pre> Hero Games (Sue) &lt;75162.372@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; If that's the case, then why wouldn't/couldn't he put it into
&gt; writing?

"If that's the case, then why wouldn't/couldn't he put it into
writing? So far as I can tell, that's because although he can do
everything in his power to keep Ivanova out of four episodes, there are
higher powers within WB/TNT who could say otherwise.  They're the ones
who hold CCs contract, not JMS."

      Every studio holds the contract on its actors; that's the same
for every show.

      Nothing could be put into writing in the form of a renegotiation
because all of the actors are on a favored nation basis...if one
renegotiates in his/her favor, they all get to renegotiate.  Any of our
cast can take fewer episodes if they agree to be paid for fewer
episodes since that favors WB.  Or they can come to me and we'll do it
unofficially, as has been done with every single cast member for 4+
years now.  Peter wanted to do "The Late Shift," I wrote him out for a
couple of episodes to accommodate that; Andreas wants to do a movie, he
asks, and I write him out.  This has never, ever been a problem.

                                                                  jms
