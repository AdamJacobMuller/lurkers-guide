"In her message, CC has quoted Copeland as saying that if TNT/WB want
her to do the 22 episodes, there's nothing that can be done about it."

      What John said was that if she wanted to be paid the full amount
(the 22 episode fee) she had to be in all 22.

"However, there still seems to be a question as to whether or not she
was informed of the correct deadlines or if WB/TNT withdrew whatever
offer was on the table before that deadline arose."

      She was.  They didn't.

      On the Thursday before the final Friday deadline, I sat in the
bar of the DeVere Hotel in Blackpool with Claudia and said, "Claudia,
the press has announced your departure from the show.  WB takes it
seriously, and I have to start writing *yesterday*.  We have to know if
you're in or out, and we have to know by mid-day (noon) tomorrow.  If
we don't get an indication from your agent that you're in, the offer
will be withdrawn."

      The offer was withdrawn at mid-day Friday, as indicated. 
Because to wait any longer would damage the show, and our chances of
getting going without missing airdates.

                                                                  jms
