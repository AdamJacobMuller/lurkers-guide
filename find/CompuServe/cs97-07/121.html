<pre> Richard P. Manny &lt;70762.141@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Cavellos' book (I certainly didn't find anything that jumped out
&gt; at me as contrary to the tv series)?

      I'd say that the Cavelos book is pretty canonical, yes...I
didn't work with the author as closely as with #9, but I agree with
just about all of the major strokes there.

                                                                  jms
