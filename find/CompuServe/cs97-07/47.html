<pre> Jonathan Kass &lt;74130.443@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; 1) Do you envision writing the entire 5th season?
&gt; 2) Whose idea is that "AOL Keyword" stuff at the end of the
&gt; show??

      No, no desire whatsoever to write all of S5, nor is there a need
to.

      And the difference is that AOL has set aside an entire *area*
just for B5, so they get the notation.  It would be as if they renamed
the sfmedone section the B5 section, there's a massive difference in
commitment.

                                                                  jms
