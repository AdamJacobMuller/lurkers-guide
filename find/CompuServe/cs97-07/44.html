"Basically, Warner Bros. was not willnig to fund a fifth season of B5
for syndication."

      Incorrect.  Not just incorrect but *massively* incorrect.

      In the past, the PTEN deal had WB and the indie stations putting
up the money for B5.

      For year 5, TNT *and* WB are both footing the bill for the fifth
season. WB *wanted* to do the show, but was finding trouble in the
current syndicated marketplace with more and more stations, and
timeslots, being committed to other programs and networks like UPN. 
TNT provided a window, and WB went through it.

                                                                  jms
