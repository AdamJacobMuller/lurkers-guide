<pre> Roseann M. Caputo &lt;103510.1542@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Why?
&gt; You don't drink, do drugs, etc?

"I know that season 5 won't be filler, because that's not what a
Master of his craft does.  You wouldn't tolerate it from anyone else,
so you surely will not do it yourself."

      Bingo.  Sometimes when I try to describe what's happening on my
side of things, I don't find the right words.  Thanks for doing so.

"You don't drink, do drugs, etc?"

      Also don't smoke or gamble.

"Wow, talk about the clean cut, all american boy! &lt;g&gt;  No vices, eh?"

      Two: Chocolate and coffee.

                                                                  jms
