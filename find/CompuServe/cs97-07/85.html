"I merely wanted to point out that JMS has seemed to USE this forum to
put over a very onesided point of view."

      You're right.  I put across one side.  Mine.  You put across
yours. How many people are supposed to inhabit my body?  It's not my
place to speak for Claudia or you or anybody else.

      I have not used words in the same way you have used them,
either; unlike you, I have not characterized the people here.  You have
called me arrogant without a) any meaning of the word, or b) anything
to back that up other than bile and spirit messages.  I have not called
anyone in this stupid, or malicious, or arrogant.

      In reviewing your messages here, however, I'm nearly prepared to
make an exception to the rule.

                                                                  jms
