"Again, I'm not saying that JMS did anything wrong, but if the studio
can supercede Joe (i.e. Joe can verbally say 'I'll do it', but the
studio still has the right to say 'no'), then I can't blame CC for
wanting something in writing &lt;shrug&gt;"

      Any studio can supercede the authority of an executive producer.

      The question, though, is one of logic.

      If Character X is not in an episode, is not written in an
episode, there is no grounds on earth for a studio to force the actor
to hang around the studio for that episode.  Never been done to my
knowledge on ANY show, anywhere, at any time.  Nor would there be any
reason to do so here.

      And WB doesn't write the scripts.  I do.  And they don't bother
us on that one.  We haven't had a creative note since year 2, episode
2, and that was mainly on a scene they wanted clarified.

      In the past, with every actor on the show, I have said, "Come to
me, and we'll work out unofficially time for you to get away."  There
are some occasions when I say, "Look, I *need* your character for this
episode, I can't do "Severed Dreams" without Sheridan," but that
doesn't happen too often.  We have never had a problem with WB over
this.  And never once have I given my word to an actor about being
available, and not had it work out.

                                                                  jms
