"I do have a question though.  Why did you opt for a new character,
instead of simply promoting Corwin?  Was this simply to save changing
Corwin's role in S5 or is there another reason?"

      It involves some things that happen later this season that
require a certain grade officer in place in S5, and would require
Corwin to jump several ranks.  He's too young and inexperienced for
that job.

                                                                  jms
