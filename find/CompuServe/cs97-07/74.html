&gt; Why can't everyone just appreaciate you for the sick, twisted,
&gt; lovable, demented, tortured, bizarre, clever, witty, devious,
&gt; genius that you are? PS: Being as I'm only 5'2", it will be
&gt; difficult for me to watch you're back and see what's coming also,
&gt; perhaps my 6'5" boyfriend will help?
