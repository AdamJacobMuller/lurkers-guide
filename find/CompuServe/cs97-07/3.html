       I know, I know, I know...I think it's just the way we're all
hard wired.  You can get 100 plaudits, but it's the one meroon who
busts your chops for something you didn't even *do* that sticks in your
mind.  Never met anyone yet that was different.  Ah, well...onward.

                                                                  jms
