<H2>Last 4 - have to redo?</H2>
<h3>Date: 02 Jul 1997 13:44:58 -0700</h3>
<pre> Alan Mulvie &lt;100566.1444@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Whats the score with Mr Garibaldi?
&gt; Ditto Valen/Sinclair - his descendants?
&gt; How did Babylon 5 get destroyed?
&gt; (from flash forwards) Who/what was on the ship escaping?
&gt; Will the Narn and Centari find peace?
&gt; Who where the enemys referred to in War without End (Delann in
&gt; the future) Does Sheridan Die (in 20 years) or evolve Like
&gt; Lionheart? Whats the score with Lionheart?
&gt; Did the Vorlons genetically engineer Telepaths?
&gt; What else did they genetically engineer?
&gt; Will Clark get booted out?
&gt; What happens to Centari Prime (in the future - war without end)
&gt; What will Sheridans Son be like- Do? If Lyta can be "enhanced2 by
&gt; the Vorlons, what did the shadows do to their servants? How does
&gt; the army of Light cope with that? If "Mankind" has some of that
&gt; technology, what will we do with it? Whats "The Rim" and whats
&gt; beyond it? Why wont there be a Babylon 6?
&gt; Will Mars become independent or unify with earth?
&gt; Now the big boys have gone, are the children gonna fight?
&gt; Will JMS let someone else write a script?
&gt; And their are plenty of other loose ends if I take time to think
&gt; about it, so the question isnt if you will have a season 5 of
&gt; fillers, but will you have enough episodes to wrap up everything
&gt; by the end of season 5?

       At least a third of those are resolved in the next batch; and a
bulk of the rest in the fifth season, plus a lot of other threads you
missed.

                                                                  jms
