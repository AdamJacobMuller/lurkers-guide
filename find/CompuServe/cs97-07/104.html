      No, it's almost impossible for an actor to be a regular on two
shows at the same time; to make the Stephen Furst thing work, for
instance, allowing him to be a regular on "Misery Loves Company," we
had to support his request, and we were happy to do that.  Most
producers would rather not.

      In terms of guest stars, though, it's pretty wide open.  Armin
has even auditioned for B5 on one occasion.  And some of our regulars,
like Pat, have done work on ST, as well as Andreas, who reprised his
character there.

                                                                  jms
