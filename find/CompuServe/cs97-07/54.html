<pre> Jonathan Kass &lt;74130.443@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is the story they have true?

      Yeah, it happened.  I haven't seen the article, but apparently
they chide me for not using a virus checker...but what did the most
damage was the trojan horse program that use deltree to systematically
start deleting my hard drive, and no checker can find those.

                                                                  jms
