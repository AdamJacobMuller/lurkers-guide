<pre> Roseann M. Caputo &lt;103510.1542@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; If, in the past, you've given your word to someone regarding
&gt; something specifc, and you've kept it, why all of a sudden is
&gt; your word not good? How many in your profession would extend that
&gt; courtesy?

      Thanks.  Yeah...ask any cast member, and they'll tell you that
when I make a promise, it's kept, no matter what it takes.

      On the reaction...it goes with the territory.  What's been
difficult have been the emails that have come in suggesting that I
"watch my back" at the next few conventions I attend.  Disagreement or
discussion is one thing; threats are another.

                                                                  jms
