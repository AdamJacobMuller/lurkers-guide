      Thanks...y'know, someone else said that the other day, a
reporter during an interview, that there were now two paradigms of the
best SF ever prouduced in this country: ST and B5.  That's a weighty
compliment, and my first reaction was to get really, really tired...but
bottom line, we did what we set out to do, kept every promise we made,
and nothing can ever take that away. We went the distance.

                                                                  jms
