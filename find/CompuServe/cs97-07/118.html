"Before coming to this forum today I was reading through a ST
newsgroup on the internet. John Ordover was busy defending himself
against criticism for things like ignoring rude messages. I'm sure you
don't find this at all surprising."

      Yeah, well, John also announced *definitively* (and with
considerable joy, I suspect) on AOL that B5 had been canceled, and
there would be no fifth season, so I'm probably the last person to ask
about this....

                                                                  jms
