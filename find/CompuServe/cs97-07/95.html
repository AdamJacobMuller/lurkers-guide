      I have little to quarrel with in any of that, though I will make
the point that there isn't really *that* much dissimilarity in our
reports, as others have pointed out...it's the behind the scenes stuff
and conversations and dates that get jumbled up in some of the reports.

      It's also a matter of perception...here you perceive that my
"side" of it, if you want to call it that, is getting more support. 
But on other nets, I've gotten a hideous amount of hate mail, and some
threats, disguised and outright.  So it's a matter of what you see, vs.
what is.  (Kinda like the overall situation.)

      Finally...as you say, you have no reason to give more weight to
one side or another in this.  But there is one aspect of this to bear
in mind. People can argue after the fact about how a tossed coin came
down, can debate whose coin it was, whether it was a dime or a quarter,
who said what about the ground it came to rest upon...and no one down
the road may have any reason to believe one report or another...but it
*did* come down, and it *did* come down either heads, or tails.

                                                                  jms
