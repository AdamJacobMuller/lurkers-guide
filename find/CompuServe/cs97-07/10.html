<H2>B5 on TNT</H2>
<h3>Date: 01 Jul 1997 02:15:43 -0700</h3>
<pre> Paul McElligott &lt;70007.3154@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; In hindsight, do you think that a deal like you've got now with
&gt; TNT would have helped the show if you'd gone that route in 93/94? 
&gt; Or is that, like, a totally stupid question?

"In hindsight, do you think that a deal like you've got now with TNT

      Oh...probably, but only about 200%.
