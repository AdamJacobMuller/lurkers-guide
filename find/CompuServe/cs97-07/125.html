<H2>Bailing on Rebelcon?</H2>

<pre> Alan L. Ravitch &lt;73627.3126@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Joe...is that a definite that you're now NOT going to do
&gt; Rebelcon?

      Yeah...I notified the con people the other day.  I'm *really*
distressed by this, because it's the first time I've ever had to bail
on a con due to work commitments (or any OTHER reason, there's never
been one before this). But given the distance, the work involved, the
deadlines looming up ahead of me, and all the rest...I can't justify
doing it.  The show has to come first.

      And I'm *really* bummed because it's John Flinn's first
convention, and I really wanted to be there to see his reaction.

                                                                  jms
