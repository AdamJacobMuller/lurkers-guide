<pre> Catherine Becic &lt;73414.2603@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; My question: For the move In The Beginning, which is then to be
&gt; followed immediately by The Gathering on TNT in January, how will
&gt; you be handling the makeup? Will it be some kind of blend between
&gt; the pilot and the series? Closer to the series and forget that it
&gt; looks different from the pilot?

       No, we're using the series makeup, rather than add one more
permutation.

                                                                  jms
