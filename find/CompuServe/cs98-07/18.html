<pre> Philip Hornsey &lt;74053.2101@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; It this someone who has given trouble before or is it a *new*
&gt; nutball? What sorta stuff is he doing?
&gt; I mean, I know he's sending you lots of email, but is there any
&gt; content? Does he have an agenda?

      No, apparently said nutball did the same thing to others, who
have sent me email mentioning receiving as many as 14,000 emails from
this guy who feels that anyone who is fan of, or involved with, B5
should behave toward him in a certain way, or he will teach them a
lesson.

      The content of the email is long and rambling and designed, I
think, to be inoffensive...it's that there are 1,000 of them at a time
that is the issue.  Fortunately, there haven't been any problems in the
last 48 hours or so, so I conclude that AOL took care of it...it's just
that they never tell you when they've done this.

                                                                  jms
