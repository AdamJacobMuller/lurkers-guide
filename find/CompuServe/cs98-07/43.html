<pre>{original post had no questions}

      I've done all the doctor stuff, taking the antibiotics, chugging
cough syrup with codeine (the colors, man, check out the
collllloooooorrrrrsssss), doing half-days at the office until I'm up
and at 'em again.

      But in this somewhat drugged state, I can only *imagine* what
the script I'm writing is gonna look like when it's done.

                                                                  jms
