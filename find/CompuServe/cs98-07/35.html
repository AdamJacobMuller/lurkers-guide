<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Have any of those who went experienced an American Creation Con?
&gt; Or even one of the early '95/96 Stargazer cons?
&gt; Dealers rooms - a very nice selection of items for sale, except (
&gt; you knew that there had to be an except ) why do they always put
&gt; the tables so close together?

      This goes pretty much along with what I've heard from others who
were there, if a bit harder in places.  The general concensus I'm
getting back is that many of the areas I felt were in need of
improvement, and said so, vocally, have indeed been improved, from the
general organization, to the treatment of stewards and fans, and the
way autographs are set up.  (I suspect they gave the bigger room to
autographs because either a) that's where they make the lion's share of
their money from selling photos, or b) to handle the long lines.)

      There are obviously still areas that can be improved, but this
does seem to indicate progress.

      However, I have still to hear any definitive response to the
requests by me and others who lent Wolf their names about the profits
that were supposed to go to charity.  As far as I've heard, unless a
check was made out directly to the charity by the attending fan, as
during the auctions, nothing ever got there.  If that's incorrect, I'd
like to know about it, but the continued silence, even and especially
stating that the information would be provided, is ominous.

      That aside, at least organizationally they seem to have made
some of the improvements a lot of people, myself included, felt were
necessary.

                                                                  jms
