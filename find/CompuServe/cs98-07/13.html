<pre> SysOp Dupa T. Parrot &lt;70040.104@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Was your quotation done for the book cover or for the SFBC?

      The quote appears on the book.  It's kind of lovely, since that
was one of the first books that got me hooked on sagas...and now I can
turn around and return the favor and help to get it out there.

                                                                  jms
