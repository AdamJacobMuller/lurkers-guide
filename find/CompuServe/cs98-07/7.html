<H2>Babylon 5 LD question</H2>
<h3>Date: 05 Jul 1998 21:01:05 -0700</h3>
<pre> Gregory Carnes &lt;103400.444@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Also if the LDs are coming out does that mean there will be DVD
&gt; editions also?

      As this is the first I've heard about it...your guess is as good
as mine.  We'll get into it, though, to do all we can to make sure this
is as good as it should be.

                                                                  jms
