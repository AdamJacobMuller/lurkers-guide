<H2>Crusade Cast Address ??</H2>
<h3>Date: 08 Jul 1998 15:33:11 -0700</h3>
<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; 1) Will snail-mail for the cast work with the same mail drop
&gt; address as the old B5 one? 2) Will the new cast members have e-
&gt; mail addresses @thestation.com? 3) The {USA} latest Starburst says
&gt; that Carrie Dobro has been signed for the role of Dureena for
&gt; Crusade? Is that correct?

1)  Will snail-mail for the cast work with the same mail drop address
as the old B5 one?

Yes, though I'd suggest using the fan club mail address rather than
the Sherman Oaks drop.

2)  Will the new cast members have e-mail addresses @thestation.com?

Almost certainly.

3)  The {USA} latest Starburst says that Carrie Dobro has been signed
for the role of Dureena for Crusade?  Is that correct?

She played in the pilot, but we never confirm for series until after
we pick up an actor's contract.

                                                                  jms
