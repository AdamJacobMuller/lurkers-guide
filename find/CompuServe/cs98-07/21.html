<pre> WizOp Wes Meier &lt;76703.747@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; What have you in the way of juicy items and tasty tidbits to
&gt; share? Are you ready for August 3?

      Well, the Excalibur set is finished, cleaned up after the
shooting of A Call to Arms, and we're building the rest of the interior
of the ship, halls, a medbay, the flight deck, a bullet car for moving
around the place, and other locations.  Also in the final stages of
casting for the various regulars.

                                                                  jms
