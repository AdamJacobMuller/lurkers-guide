<pre> Carl Cantarella &lt;105030.3700@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Since the first day of shooting is so near, can we expect a full
&gt; cast announcement within the next few days?

      One can expect many things...how many of them happen, who can
say?

                                                                 jms*
