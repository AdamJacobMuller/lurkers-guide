<pre> Graham Smith &lt;74010.764@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; How much were you influenced by this movie when you wrote the
&gt; part of Lyta (particularly the character development)? Or is my
&gt; imagination running on overtime again?

      No, you're just seeing similarities in performance; all I wanted
was a strong performer, and I saw one.

                                                                  jms
