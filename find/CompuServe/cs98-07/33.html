<pre> Kevin Kenney &lt;104102.352@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Now that you wowed us with Thirdspace, and mentioned on Usenet
&gt; that it came from your desire to do something Lovecraftian, can
&gt; you say anything about what your purpose was behind, or what we
&gt; should look forward to in River of Souls? I don't know how you
&gt; afforded all the effects in Thirdspace, and wonder, due to less
&gt; cast members being involved, if the budget's a bit less on River?

      The budget on all 4 of the TNT movies is the same.  As for
"River," it's a much more in-depth script than "Thirdspace," which was
mainly just for fun. River gets into the question of identity, the
nature of the soul, it has some very funny but also some very moving
stuff...while there are some things I prefer about "In the Beginning,"
in some ways "River" is a better movie.

                                                                  jms
