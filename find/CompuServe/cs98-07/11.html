<H2>Hello, old friend</H2>
<h3>Date: 05 Jul 1998 21:01:06 -0700</h3>
<pre> Richard M Perry &lt;76461.2737@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Speaking of Spidey, did you catch the "Identity Crisis"
&gt; storyline? So, when are you going to talk to Stan Lee about
&gt; getting you to write for Spidey?

      That's the key: find what excites you, and do it.  Follow your
joy; the rest will take care of itself.

                                                                  jms
