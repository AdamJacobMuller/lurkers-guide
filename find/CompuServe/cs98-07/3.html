<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; I realize that it's sort of a barn door/horse issue right now,
&gt; but have you considered getting another e-mail address someplace
&gt; and keeping it private from everyone who doesn't need it for
&gt; business?

      Thing is, I use the main address for email interviews with
magazines and the like...and as soon as I gave that address to one
reporter, everybody'd have it.

                                                                  jms
