<pre>      Just a couple of quickies:

      1) I know it's that season, but because I don't do christmas,
any christmas cards sent to me get roundfiled.  Invest the postage in a
donation to a local charity.  But don't send me stuph.

      2) Please do not send me binary files or uploads without first
checking with me ahead of time.  I had my hard disk nearly killed by a
trojan horse, and make it a practice now not to download ANYthing
unless I know what it is and whence it comes.

      And again, please, please, please do not send email with story
related questions...you may think you're the only one doing this, it's
just the one, but there are between 10-15 *million* people watching B5,
and an awful lot of them are on the nets, and I can't keep answering
the same story questions in email all the time (and many of them are
much the same).  If you have a story related question, please post it
in the public forums so that others can benefit from the answer, and so
I only have to write it once.

                                                                  jms
