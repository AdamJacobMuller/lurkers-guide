<pre> Catherine Becic &lt;73414.2603@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; and what of the prophetesses?

      They weren't prophetesses, they were communications-telepaths,
and the emperor can use them if he perceives the need to keep in
contact with events in the royal court.  Cartagia could give a fig for
what goes at home, which will be ash soon anyway....

                                                                  jms
