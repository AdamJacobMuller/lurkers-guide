<pre> Scott Baker &lt;76072.1744@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; So how do you convey to the director and actors what you see in
&gt; your head? Do you make notes on the script, or do you talk it out,
&gt; or what?

       We have tone meetings where I go over every scene with the
director, so we both know what's required, what the subtext is, and so
on.

                                                                  jms
