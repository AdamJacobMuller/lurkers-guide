<pre> Michael Beemer &lt;71551.1670@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Will you adjust the episode order so that TNT broadcasts it in
&gt; the "correct" order when they strip it?

       Not really, because it doesn't make *that* much difference to
risk confusing them about it....

                                                                  jms
