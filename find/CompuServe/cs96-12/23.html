<pre> S.G. Menzel &lt;100537.1517@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; do you think it might help if a lot of people would tell WB that
&gt; they'd be willing to buy B5 on LD?

       No, it's a status thing, primarily...they don't like to sully
their hands with TV, they prefer to handle the big-budget movies
exclusively.

                                                                  jms
