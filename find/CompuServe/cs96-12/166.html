<pre> Carl Cantarella &lt;105030.3700@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Can you tell me anything more about this, or have we indeed been
&gt; left to draw our own conclusion in that regard?

      I figure a) it's left to the viewer, and b) from my POV, he saw
what he said he saw.

                                                                  jms
