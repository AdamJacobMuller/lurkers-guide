<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;75063.3305@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Given what we know of the content of "Atonement," and given that
&gt; it's known that an actor has been signed to play Dukhat in that
&gt; episode (presumably in flashbacks), can we assume Mira is going
&gt; to have to get back into that full Minbari makeup again? How
&gt; does/did she like that idea?

      Yes, Mira got into the original year-one makeup.  It's
funny...when I walked out onto the set, and saw her in that prosthetic,
the first words that came out of my mouth were, "It's *you*!  I haven't
seen you in almost three years, how've you been?"

      I don't think Mira quite knew what to make of me.

                                                                  jms
