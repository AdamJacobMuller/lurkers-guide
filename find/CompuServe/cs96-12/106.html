       I don't see it really as a change of heart...they've always
been very ruthless in their way.  Remember, it was the Vorlons who
simply decided to off Deathwalker in first season.

       There's some amount of escalation going on, obviously, which
will be explained a bit more in upcoming episodes, but they've always
been this way, it's your perception of them that's at odds.  You fell
for what they wanted you to see them to be.

                                                                  jms
