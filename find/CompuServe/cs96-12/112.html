      NBC didn't reject it, it was meant for syndication after the
network show was canceled; and most of the cast had moved on to do
other things. Actors don't generally just hang around waiting for shows
to get revived, they were not available in many cases, and my mandate
was to give the show a fresh start.

                                                                  jms
