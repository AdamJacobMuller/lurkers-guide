      Actually, we kinda decided to cut back a bit on lens
flare...because that particular one is now used in so many places, it's
become a cliche.  We tried out a new kind of flare in the Kosh2 scene,
when he nails Sheridan, you can just sorta see it...once everyone else
does what we've been doing, we tend to move on to newer areas.

                                                                  jms
