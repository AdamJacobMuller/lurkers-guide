<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; But haven't you already done the single episode format on MSW,
&gt; and other series you've been on? What's between the arc and the
&gt; stand alone shows?

      Well, basically, all there *is* are either arc shows or
stand-alone shows (or maybe somewhat stand-alones with a slight thread
running through them).  My feeling for now is that I just don't want to
do the same thing twice in a row...and maybe find some new approaches
along the way to the next project.

      You must understand how hideously difficult and exhausting
telling a 5 year tightly constructed story like this is...basically,
over the course of 4 years, I'll have written 3,000 pages all in one
universe, primarily telling one story.  That's the equivilent of 6 or 7
full-size novels in 4 years, telling one story.  After something like
that, you want to do something a little different for a bit.

      Four years ago, when I started carrying this elephant, I barely
had a grey hair on my head...now it's gone almost entirely grey, I look
as if I've aged 10 years, and people who see me after a gap of a few
years all say the same thing: "What the hell HAPPENED to you?"  I tell
them: Babylon 5.

                                                                  jms
