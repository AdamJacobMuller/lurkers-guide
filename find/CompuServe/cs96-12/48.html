<H2>Another Kosh Query</H2>
<h3>Date: 03 Dec 1996 15:16:53 -0700</h3>
<pre> Bryan Morton &lt;106454.3602@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I was just answering a post on that in another thread, and a
&gt; thought occurred to me (doesn't happen very often &lt;g&gt;): was FTA
&gt; the episode where Kosh *should* have died, had you stuck to your
&gt; original intentions? If so, would he have gone out in the same way
&gt; (helping to kill another Vorlon), or would he have been in Darth
&gt; Kosh's position?

       Best to leave what might've been out...what is, is better.

                                                                  jms
