<pre> SysOp Dupa T Parrot &lt;70040.104@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is that a "Bitsurfer PRO" or just a "Bitsurfer"?
&gt; BTW, have you tried the ISDN forum (go ISDN)?

       I have the Bitsurfer PRO, yes...and the line is all
configured...the installation tests show a green light...I just can't
seem to get it to work with 3.1, I couldn't find a server that handled
ISDN in the area, so in the end I pretty much gave up and now it just
sits there, mocking me....

                                                                  jms
