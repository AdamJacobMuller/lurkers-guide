<pre> Carl Cantarella &lt;105030.3700@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Hey Joe, have we now gotten to see exactly what a Vorlon looks
&gt; like beneath that suit, or was our friend Kosh2 somehow visually
&gt; obscured and\or distorted by the trap that had been set for him?

       That's pretty much what they look like.

                                                                  jms
