<pre> gopher &lt;75410.177@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; At which point, the mother chimed-in and said "But you watch
&gt; Babylon 5 now, so you're all better?" It's been wonderful to see
&gt; B5 comments go from "What's that?" to "Isn't that the show with
&gt; the funny hair?"

      That's a great story, thanks.
