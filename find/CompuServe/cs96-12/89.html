      The B5 reference in Captain Power was just a nod to something I
was working on...and definitely shows that it was in the works as far
back as 1986.

      Yes, we have shown diseases, particularly in "Confessions and
Lamentations," a 2nd season episode.  But in general, my sense is that
the biologies of aliens are sufficiently different to minimize most
transmitted diseases.

                                                                  jms
