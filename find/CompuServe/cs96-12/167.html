<pre> Michael N. Rubinste &lt;74012.147@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; He probably got all kinds of details from that scan; otherwise
&gt; how could he have saved Kosh? Kyle since?

      It was noted in season 1 that Dr. Kyle was reassigned to
Earthdome, under President Clark.

                                                                  jms
