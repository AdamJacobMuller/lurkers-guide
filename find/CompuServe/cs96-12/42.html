<pre> Elyse M. Grasso &lt;70302.3304@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Did Turhan come to the throne very late in life and reign only
&gt; briefly? If Turhan reigned a long time, who kept the 'pain
&gt; technicians' busy and gave Londo (who had only been at court for
&gt; a short time when he talked to G'Kar) the opportunity to see
&gt; prisoners being tortured and vivisected for the amusement of the
&gt; court? Cartagia seems very over the top to us, but does he seem
&gt; less excessive to Centauri who look back on the days when
&gt; Turhan's father personally ordered the execution of 100,0000
&gt; Narns?

       I'd say that Turhan was probably emperor for about 30 years or
so.

                                                                  jms
