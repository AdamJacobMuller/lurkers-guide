<pre> Rebecca Eschliman &lt;76072.2345@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Who knows, maybe upon her return home she will tune in just to

      Be of good cheer (despite the season)...they're as real to me as
they are to anyone else.

      Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go stop G'Kar from
frightening the neighbor's cat again....
