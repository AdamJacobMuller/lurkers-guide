<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;75063.3305@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I was awonderin': Since Sheridan had close contact with numerous
&gt; alien races before coming to B5 ("even a few Minbari") and had
&gt; picked up a few words of, at least, Narn ("All Alone in the
&gt; Night"), does he know *any* Minbari? Has he picked up any in the
&gt; last two to three years of close *ahem* contact with the Minbari? 
&gt; Do you have any plans for him to try to learn some or all of the
&gt; language?

       When he has a bit more time, what with this pesky war and all,
he'll almost certainly undertake this.

                                                                  jms
