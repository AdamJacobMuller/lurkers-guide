<pre> Kevin P. Kenney &lt;104102.352@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; But it couldn't have been everything, could it?
&gt; So, in broad strokes, could you define the order in which you
&gt; created the universe/story? On the other end, was there anything
&gt; major in what we've seen so far that got added in after the fact? 
&gt; I guess that Sheridan is #1 here, now 'bout #2?

      Doesn't work that way.  I can't separate out the elements like
that, it's all of a piece.  It's like, when someone asks you to
remember your first relationship, you don't define it or bring it up in
terms of trips in cars, clothes you were wearing, or the like.  It's a
whole.  And that's how I tend to tell, and how I developed, the
story...sort of like remembering it all.

                                                                  jms
