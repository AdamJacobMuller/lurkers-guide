<H2>B5 censored in UK</H2>

<pre>{original post had no questions}

      Just a note, but so far the 4th season hasn't aired in the UK
yet, and thus hasn't yet been censored, so this header is kind of a
misnomer.  Also, I have no idea yet what C4 has in mind, and perhaps it
might be a good idea to see what they do, and react to it, rather than
jumping to conclusions based on what they *might* do....

                                                                  jms
