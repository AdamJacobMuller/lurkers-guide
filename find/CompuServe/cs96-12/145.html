       Thanks.  I'd love to check out the comics.  Because of the
press of work (and so many of the books out there started getting
crummy, in my view), I've kind of gotten out of the comics habit over
the last year, so I have no info on this one.  Best to send it along to
me via the B5 mail drop, 14431 Ventura Boulevard, Suite 260, Sherman
Oaks, CA 91423.  Thanks again, for the kind words and the reference.

                                                                  jms
