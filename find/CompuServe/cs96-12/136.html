<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;75063.3305@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Therefore, my question, considering how you probably had to work
&gt; to get all three of the "Babylon Squared" stars back at the same
&gt; time for WWE, is: Was "Walkabout" originally intended to take
&gt; place before the events in "War Without End"?

       Correct.  Initially we'd wanted to put Walkabout in first, but
that would have meant airing only WWE1 in that sweeps period, and
having to wait until the fall for part 2, which seemed not only
excessive but remarkably stupid.  So we reversed the shooting/airing
order to accommodate that, and the fact that we knew we'd need a LOT of
EFX in WWE1, and this would give us time to do it properly.

                                                                  jms
