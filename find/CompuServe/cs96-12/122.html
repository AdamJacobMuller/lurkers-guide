<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;75063.3305@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; So, I take it he didn't pick up much conversational Minbari on
&gt; his trips and contacts with the other races, eh?

      Yup.  Because during the Minbari war, the Narns were selling us
weapons, so Sheridan and other Earthforce captains had to learn at
least a smattering of Narnish for purposes of negotiations.

                                                                  jms
