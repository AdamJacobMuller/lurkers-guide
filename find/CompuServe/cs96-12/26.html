       Actually, I won't be at either Chicago ComicCon or the Irish
con, as it turns out, since I'm tagged as guest of honor at Westercon
50 in Seattle that weekend.  I hope to do ChiCon next year, since it's
a great experience, and the Irish one next time I'm in the area.

                                                                  jms
