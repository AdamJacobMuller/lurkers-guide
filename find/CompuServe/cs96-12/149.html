<pre> Scott J. Epstein &lt;71514.2733@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; BTW, Joe, cross-culturally, how does the Minbari sleep-watching
&gt; ritual compare in seriousness to a human marriage proposal?

      Well, I think it fair to say that with Delenn starting the
ritual, there had already been kind of an implicit understanding that
this was going to be more than just a fling...and there's still a long
road ahead of them before this can be finalized.

                                                                  jms
