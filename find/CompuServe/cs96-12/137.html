<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; How does Hyperspace / Jump Gate technology work?
&gt; Does it create a bend in the space and time continuum where they
&gt; (ships) can travel faster than light?

      It opens a way to hyperspace, which does not have a 1-1
corrolation to our own space, allowing us to subvert the limitation of
light speed.

                                                                  jms
