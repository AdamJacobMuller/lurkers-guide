<pre> Scott Baker &lt;76072.1744@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Was it my imagination or did the Vorlons look like the shadows?
&gt; And if so, would the reason the Vorlons hide in encounter suits
&gt; be because when they leave they have to project the right images
&gt; to people?

       I didn't think they looked that much alike.  But then, no two
people ever see Vorlons in quite the same way, I guess.

                                                                  jms
