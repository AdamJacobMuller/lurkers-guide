<pre> Phyllis Schmulenson &lt;72447.224@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; If the show is ended in the 4th rather then the fifth year how
&gt; does that change the orginal arc plan- what happened according to
&gt; the opening on the first year sinclair was to be the last
&gt; comander of B5?

      Actually, Sinclair wasn't identified by name in the pilot
episode as the final CO.

                                                                  jms
