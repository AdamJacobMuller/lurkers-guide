       Sheridan, or someone like him, would've been brought in around
this time regardless, yes...but knowing this would happen, I was able
to skew the new character to have the elements, and be in the position,
that would most help me move the story along.

       And you're right...the longer you leave someone in command
there in the show, the more difficult and dangerous it becomes to
remove that character. If you're going to do it, best to do it earlier
than later.

                                                                  jms
