<pre> Michael Grabois &lt;74737.2600@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; So then why the tapes in the UK?
&gt; Or is that some other company?

      UK tapes are under a different divsion of WB.  WB International
and WB Domestic are wholly different divisions...WB isn't one company
like Universal or Paramount, but a series of competing fiefdoms with
their own rules and agendas.

                                                                  jms
