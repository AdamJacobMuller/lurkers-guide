<H2>JMS: season 4 = arc end?</H2>
<h3>Date: 03 Dec 1996 15:16:01 -0700</h3>
<pre> Scott Baker &lt;76072.1744@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Who held the 22 script record?
&gt; Was that Terry Nation?
&gt; So how far do these 39 scripts go (Episode Num to Ep Num)?
&gt; And, better yet, how do you manage to be an Executive Producer, a
&gt; writer, and have a life all at the same time?

       Actually, Nation's record was about 13 or 18 in a row.

       And of those three elements, the personal life is the one that
has to go out the window to make the other two work.

                                                                  jms
