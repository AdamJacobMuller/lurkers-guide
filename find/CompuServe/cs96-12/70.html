<pre> ben dibble &lt;105430.3170@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Could you possibly tell us the "Story of Kosh?"
&gt; Are we ready for this information?
&gt; Or does it still contain hidden bits of story?
&gt; _Why_ did Kosh open his suit to "Sinclair?"
&gt; Are you going to tell me he was *actually* going to shake hands?
&gt; Had Kosh read up on Earthers and already gone Native?
&gt; And was this information provided to Sinclair by Delenn?
&gt; Or was that a case of Minbari dissembling?
&gt; What did Delenn see when she went to see Kosh, and *why* did she
&gt; go? Can you ___finally___ give us her prophesy?
&gt; Is this your story to stick with?

         There's a lot more to be said of the story of Kosh, and the
Vorlons in general...and part of me says explain it later...and another
part says that if you explain mysteries too much, it destroys them.

                                                                  jms
