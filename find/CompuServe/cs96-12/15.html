<H2>Sheridan chgd the Arc?</H2>
<h3>Date: 02 Dec 1996 02:48:58 -0700</h3>
<pre> Joseph Schierer &lt;76326.3124@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I wonder how much this fact has changed the original Arc?
&gt; For example, The flash-forward of the older Sinclair in Babylon
&gt; Squared - Was there a different (pe- Sheridan) 'explanation' than
&gt; the one presented in WWE? Did the Arc change significantly, due to
&gt; the change in cast??

      You'd be surprised how much it *didn't* change.....

                                                                  jms
