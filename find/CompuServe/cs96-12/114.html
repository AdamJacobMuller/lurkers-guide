       Yes, B5 is fiction...but elements of it that appear here and
there are based on historical incident.  The CDA and other moves toward
censoring the arts or the internet or free speech are the logical
inheritors of Joe McCarthy's Senatorial inquisition, as well as earlier
verions.  The Nightwatch goes right back to those roots...and anyone
who thinks it can't happen here...it *has* happened here.  And can
happen again tomorrow.

                                                                  jms
