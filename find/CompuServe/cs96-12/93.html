<pre>{original post had no questions}

      We're actually doing a few small things via the B5 fan club.  We
just Friday took delivery of our first batch of t-shirts made in-house:
they have the B5FC logo on the front left breast, and come in three
colors...one in black with white lettering saying "No boom today, boom
tomorrow, there's always a boom tomorrow" black for Ivanova's mood...a
white one (for the angelic seeming vorlons) with black lettering, "We
have always been here"... and a grey t-shirt with "We stand between the
darkness and the light" (the grey here is obvious).

      We should be releasing these shortly.

                                                                  jms
