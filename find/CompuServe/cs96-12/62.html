<pre> S.G. Menzel &lt;100537.1517@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I am aware, this is a completely different matter, but you
&gt; wouldn't have any good advice on how to get ones hands on your
&gt; scriptwriting book outside the U.S.?

       Go onto the worldwide net to http://www.amazon.com, and you can
order it from anywhere in the world....

                                                                  jms
