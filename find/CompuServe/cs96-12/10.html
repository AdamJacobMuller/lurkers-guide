<H2>Kosh(s), clarification</H2>
<h3>Date: 01 Dec 1996 20:18:28 -0700</h3>
<pre> gopher &lt;75410.177@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; 1) Have we now seen a real Vorlon?
&gt; So is the primary purpose of their encounter suits only to hide
&gt; their appearance? Since the yellow entity wasn't all Kosh-1, but
&gt; still looked like a "Vorlon", do all life-forces look the same? 4)
&gt; Was Sheridan dead again (after Kosh-1 et al left him)?

      Yes, yes, maybe, no.

                                                                  jms
