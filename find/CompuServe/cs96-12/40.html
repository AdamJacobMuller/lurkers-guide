<pre> Deonaha M. Conlin &lt;102531.2627@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; So MOH departure WAS unexpected?

       I've always said that it was something I began to realize was
necessary about two-thirds of the way into season 1, and as I began to
plan out season 2.

                                                                  jms
