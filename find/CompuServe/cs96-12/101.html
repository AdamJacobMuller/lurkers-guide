<pre> Michael R. Brehmer &lt;75303.2242@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; However, have you ever considered creating a alien species whose
&gt; various emotions are totally outside the mainstream of human
&gt; emotion and are 100% unintelligible?

       The only problem becomes using a 100% unintelligible character
in any kind of story.  It's hard to structure something like that.  The
closest I've come to is Kosh.

                                                                  jms
