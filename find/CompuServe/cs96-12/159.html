<H2>Vorlon Question</H2>
<h3>Date: 18 Dec 1996 23:55:50 -0700</h3>
<pre> Scott Baker &lt;76072.1744@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; But the Vorlons are a lifeform and I thought you said they were
&gt; crystiline? Or are they a lifeform?

      Silicon or crystalline based lifeforms are still lifeforms, just
not the same as carbon-based lifeforms (like us).

                                                                  jms
