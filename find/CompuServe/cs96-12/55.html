<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; That's depressing...but they won't let you have the rights to
&gt; release them? What if we wrote about *that*...&lt;G&gt;?

      Nope again.  They're like a monkey with its fist around a nut in
a jar; they won't let go, and can't take it out, or let anyone else
have it.  But we will keep working at it...sooner or later, we'll win. 
We always do.
