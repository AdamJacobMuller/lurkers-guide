<H2>JMS: season 4 = arc end?</H2>
<h3>Date: 04 Dec 1996 11:58:14 -0700</h3>
<pre> Scott Baker &lt;76072.1744@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Do you miss the trade off?
&gt; I know you love your work, and you are doing a superb job, but
&gt; I'm curious if you feel you're missing something?

       "I'm curiuos if you feel you're missing something?"

       Having had a personal life, I found it vastly over-rated.

       More seriously, though...I figure it's no different than
joining the military for five years.  Except for the running, jumping,
shooting and getting killed bits.

                                                                  jms
