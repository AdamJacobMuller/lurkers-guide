<pre>      Okay, I'm gonna keep this real short and real simple.

      You wanna see the end of the story?  Huh?  Do you?  Do you?!
                                                          ~~~~~~
      THEN GIVE ME THE DAMNED CHEAT CODES FOR "QUAKE!"

      Just that.  Okay?  And I can get back to work, and nobody gets
hurt.
