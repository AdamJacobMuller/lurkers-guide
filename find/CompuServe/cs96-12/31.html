<pre> Scott Baker &lt;76072.1744@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is there any particular character who bangs the camera more often
&gt; than not? And how often does the finished product match what you
&gt; "saw"?

       The finished film comes startlingly close to what I saw in my
head at least 85% of the time.  The other times, it falls below, or
goes beyond.

                                                                  jms
