<pre> Craig M. Bobchin &lt;102354.3246@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Does anyone know where to get a child's B5 shirt or even if they
&gt; make them?

       Ah, the shirt you describe is from All-U.  I posted the number
here for the company a while ago, but don't have it at hand.  I'll try
to dig it up, but in the interim, if some friendly person happens to
have it nearby, and posts it, that would save you some time.

                                                                  jms
