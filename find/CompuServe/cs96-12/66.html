<H2>History recap?</H2>
<h3>Date: 04 Dec 1996 17:06:27 -0700</h3>
<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Am I right so far?
&gt; What I'm wondering is at what point did we meet the Centauri?
&gt; And when did they give us the jumpgate technology?
&gt; Before or after the war?

       No, our first contact was with the Centauri, who gave us the
tech. We didn't meet the Minbari until long, long afterward.

                                                                  jms
