<H2>B5 censored in UK</H2>
<h3>Date: 19 Dec 1996 23:13:26 -0700</h3>
<pre> Philip Eldridge &lt;100723.2754@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; If they do cut it would you be consulted or would it just be get
&gt; out the scissors and cellotape? Surely being the creative force
&gt; behind the series it must annoy you to see someone tamper with
&gt; your work? Is there any truth to the stories of TNT syndicating
&gt; B5? If so how will this affect a possible series 5?

      TNT picks up B5 whenever it's done, whether that's 4 or 5 years,
so it doesn't affect us either way.

      My only concern on the C4 thing is that, as far as I know,
nothing has been indicated by C4 either way on cuts of any sort, and I
know just enough about TV folks to know that if people act before even
*they* have reached a concensus, and may not in fact be accurate, it
tends to move them in the opposite direction from that desired.

                                                                  jms
