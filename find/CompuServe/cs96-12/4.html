<pre> James &amp; Deb's &lt;101355.3704@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Enjoy.Have you tried Duke nuckem 3D yet?

      Thanks!

      I've done some with Duke Nukem, but the thing's just a bit
repetitive for me, so I haven't gotten that deeply into the game yet.

                                                                  jms
