<pre> Laurence Moroney &lt;100546.50@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; May I ask another question?
&gt; I have been curious about the strange scheduling of the show in
&gt; the USA (I arrived here just in time for season 4), and wonder if
&gt; it actually *helps* the quality of the show??? What do you think
&gt; of this? Was this the writers exhaustion reaching the screen
&gt; having written all of season 3 and a huge chunk of season 2?

       The long broadcast breaks don't give us a break because we
don't stop filming during them.  We start filming at the beginning of
August, and we shoot straight through to May, with only breaks for
holidays and a quick one-week hiatus in the fall and spring.  It would
be hideously expensive and difficult to stop and start shooting every
five weeks.

                                                                  jms
