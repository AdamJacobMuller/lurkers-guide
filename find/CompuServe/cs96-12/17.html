<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;75063.3305@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I know Delenn had to be at the Great Vorlon Battle for the sake
&gt; of the story, but, as the author, can you tell us why she decided
&gt; to go there? Was it the noise of the battle that attacted her?
&gt; Was she informed of the battle beforehand, and we just didn't
&gt; know about it? Did someone clue her in, and she ran down there to
&gt; witness it and/or look out for John?

      Well, I think it's pretty obvious she would've known about it,
given hr proximity to Sheridan...and if I knew something this big was
going on, sure as heck *I'd* want to be there to see it.

                                                                  jms
