      Never said I never wanted to do *any* merchandising...what I've
always said was that I wanted to do a little, here and there, adding a
bit as we go along, but doing so gradually, so we could control the
quality of the items, to make sure that fans didn't get stuck with
crummy stuff.

      Mainly, I approve to merchandise anything that I think is either
very cool, or which I'd like to have myself.

                                                                  jms
