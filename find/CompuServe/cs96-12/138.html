<H2>Spinoff arc?</H2>
<h3>Date: 16 Dec 1996 22:37:19 -0700</h3>
<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; If the spinoff deal goes through, would it have an arc like the
&gt; original, or have you even planned for that eventuality yet?

      It would have an arc, yes, but not as rigorous as the one in B5;
I've kind of done that now, and would like to try something
different...I don't like to try and walk in the same stream twice, to
borrow a metaphor from Greek philosophy.

                                                                  jms
