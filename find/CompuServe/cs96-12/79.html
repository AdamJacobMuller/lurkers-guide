<pre> SUSAN F. KIRN &lt;76262.2013@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Joe, On the flip side of the coin, do the actors ever come to you
&gt; for clarification or advice on how a scene is to be played?

      That, yes...very often, while the actor is prepping, they'll
come by my office, or at lunch ask about a particular passage, for
clarification on my part, as opposed to an adjustment on their
performance.

                                                                  jms
