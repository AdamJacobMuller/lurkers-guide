<pre> Will Caraway &lt;73671.2434@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; First when the Vorlons and Shadows divided up the galaxy, who got
&gt; Earth? Also, did this division match the division between the
&gt; Shadows and Centari? In regards to Lorien's statement that he is
&gt; The First One, does this mean was the first sentient being, the
&gt; last survivor of the first sentient race, the first sentient
&gt; being to achieve sufficient control of life energy to be
&gt; "immortal"? Also, is Z'HaDum Lorien's home world and if not why
&gt; did he hang out there so long?

      There was no clear division...they both tried to influence
everyone they came upon, to get them to go one way or the other.

                                                                  jms
