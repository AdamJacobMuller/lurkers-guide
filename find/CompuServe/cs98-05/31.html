<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Will Columbia House still offer the B5 tapes?

      I don't know; I think they had a one-year trial on this thing
for the first season's worth of tapes, and with WB getting into it, I
don't know how this will break out down the road when that trial
expires.

                                                                  jms
