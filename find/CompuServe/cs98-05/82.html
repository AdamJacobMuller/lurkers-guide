<pre> Shawn D. Ratner &lt;73753.175@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I was wondering who owns the rights to Crusade, Warner Brothers
&gt; or TNT? How is Crusade's development going?

      WB owns the rights to Crusade...and we're in serious
preproduction now on Crusade (casting, design work, other stuff).

                                                                  jms
