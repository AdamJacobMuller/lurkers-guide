<H2>Easter Egg in Guide?</H2>
<h3>Date: 26 May 1998 16:45:13 -0700</h3>
<pre> Jeff Peterman &lt;75361.430@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Are there two versions of the Guide?
&gt; So, are they just a little slow in thier reviews or is their a
&gt; new version?

      They're just a little slow...there's only the one version.

                                                                  jms
