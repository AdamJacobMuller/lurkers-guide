<pre> David Crader &lt;104635.1044@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; How many episodes per tape???
&gt; Will they go the excellent Fox route ala The X-Files and put two
&gt; on a tape, or will they take the Paramount Star Trek screw-job
&gt; route and have only one?????

      It's two per tape.

                                                                  jms
