<pre> Bill Hirst &lt;104106.431@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; But what about Crusade?

      Funny thing is...I've written about 200 or so produced episodes
of TV. Assuming a bit over one third of that is animation, figure 80
half hours and 120 one-hour shows...that's 160 hours of TV...the
average network programs series from 8-11 p.m. 7 days a week, that's 21
hours a week...so it would fill 8 weeks of prime-time programming on
one network, plus the five B5 movies.

      Suddenly I have the profound urge to take a nap....

                                                                  jms
