<pre> Michael Kalus &lt;100265.3065@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; How is the stage being build?
&gt; How is this with B5 or was this toally bullshitting ?

      What I think they're referring to is the level of detail put
into finishing a set; there are imperfections you'll never see on the
average 27" TV screen that will be huge and obvious on a 35' movie
screen.  So that may be what they mean.  It's common to go for the
former level of detail than the latter on most TV.

                                                                  jms
