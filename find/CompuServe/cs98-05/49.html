<H2>Crusade Pilot?</H2>

<pre> Darran Williams &lt;101656.2143@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; You said recently that 'A Call to Arms' was a lead-in to Crusade
&gt; and not a pilot, does this mean will be doing another feature
&gt; length pilot for Crusade or will the first episode be of normal
&gt; length ?

      No, the first episode will be of normal length.  A Call to Arms
is primarily a B5 movie, which sets the incidents in place that lead to
Crusade, which then hits the ground running with its first episode,
regular length, same as the other 21 TNT has signed for.

                                                                  jms
