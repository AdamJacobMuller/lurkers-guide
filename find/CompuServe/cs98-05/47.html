<pre> Guy Schwartz &lt;103343.116@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Does that add to $$$ for WB, or you, or do they allready pay for
&gt; the right to air twice, thrice, etc?

      No, they paid for the rights for a given period of time, during
which they can run it as many times as they want.

                                                                  jms
