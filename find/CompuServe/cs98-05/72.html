      It would take a hell of a lot more than greying hair and
wrinkles to make me look respectable.

      And yeah, the show has definitely aged me.  I recently saw a
friend whom I haven't seen face to face since about year 1 of B5, and
the first words out of his mouth were "Jesus Christ what happened to
YOU?"  (Thanks, great to see you, too....)

                                                                  jms
