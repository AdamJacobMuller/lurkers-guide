<pre> Shane Shellenbarger &lt;104305.3404@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; and will you be giving a B5/Crusade presentation?

      At this point, I don't know if I can do SDCC or not this year; I
had to cancel out one convention already around that time, because of
the need to gear up Crusade.  I'd assumed that I wouldn't have anything
going this Summer, so I booked a number of conventions all in the same
two month period of time, kind of a post-B5 blitzkreig.  Then all hell
broke loose.  So I may either not go (first time for that in 12 years)
or just pop down on one day for a quick Dealer's Room run-through and
out.  I can't just go for the one day if I do my full
presentation...I'm too whacked afterward for shopping at the DR, and I 
can do so beforehand because I'm prepping for the presentation.  So
I'm kinda unsure right now what to do, and what I'll have time for.

                                                                  jms
