<H2>B5 video release</H2>
<h3>Date: 22 May 1998 17:43:09 -0700</h3>
<pre> FRANK J. FURFARO &lt;74031.1005@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is that how WB is handling the release, or will they also be
&gt; available individually? Also, do you know how many eps are going
&gt; to be in the first release?

      I think the 3 pack is the initial release, but all will be
available individually.

                                                                  jms
