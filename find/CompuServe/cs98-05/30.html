<pre> Rebecca Costello &lt;71045.3050@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; My sister turned to me and asked, "Why does she say that?
&gt; Isn't peace more important than victory?"
&gt; As one person put it, we're just about swimming in the
&gt; interpretations at this point, so I'd like to ask you: what was
&gt; your intention with those lines?

      Peace can be a surrender as well as an achievement, especially
when facing an enemy dedicated to something unpleasant.  Chamberlin
returned from a visit to Germany with a so-called agreement in his
hands, and announced that by granting concessions to Hitler, he had
achieved "peace in our time."

      Peace is a byproduct of victory against those who do not want
peace.
