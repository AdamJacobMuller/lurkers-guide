<pre> Will Caraway &lt;73671.2434@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Was Kosh actually poisoned or did he just fake it for the
&gt; natives?

      No, he wasn't faking it.  Understand that their appearance as a
being of light is only how they want to appear; they are life forms
much the same as many others, and can be poisoned if one knows the
right combination of substances.

                                                                  jms
