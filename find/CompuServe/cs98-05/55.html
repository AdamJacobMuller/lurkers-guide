      Thanks...it's been a hard road, but in the final analysis, it
was the right thing to do.

      But it does illustrate the weaknesses in the Usenet system,
however well intentioned, that I've practically *never* had to post a
note like that here on Compuserve, which doesn't allow such behavior.

                                                                  jms
