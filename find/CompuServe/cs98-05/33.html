<h3>Date: 18 May 1998 14:17:11 -0700</h3>
<pre> Philip Hornsey &lt;74053.2101@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Did you film B5 in theater dimentions so that it would represent
&gt; an easily available series which could provide HDTV content for
&gt; the new stations which will be scrambling for it?

      Yes, B5 was filmed in widescreen and cropped for contemporary TV
format; same will be the case for Crusade.

                                                                  jms
