      I'm surprised...no, astounded, really, that you would ask me
this.

      What you are saying is that you want me to help your friend to
find a way around the problem of publishing an unauthorized book that
would not exist were it not for Babylon 5, but for which your friend
does not want to share any of the money or profit for that book with
the studio and entity that created it.  Granted that my portion of any
of this is barely enough to register...nonetheless, he is going to be
basing those trivia questions based on characters, dialogue and
situations that I created...but he does not see any reason why I, as
the person responsible for the material he is going to print, should
benefit from this book.

      If your friend wants to do a B5 trivia book, then I suggest he
take the very simple steps involved in doing so in an authorized, legal
and responsible fashion.

                                                                  jms
