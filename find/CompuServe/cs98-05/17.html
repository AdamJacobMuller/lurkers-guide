      No, I don't feel I need to defend it...but a lot of people made
a big deal about who you should believe...and now it's clear what was
going on at the time was what I said it was...and a few folks are
saying, "Well, now it doesn't matter."  Well, it does matter, when it's
my integrity and honesty that's at issue.  If the original question was
worth some folks making a big deal out of it, then getting the facts
straight should merit as much attention.

                                                                  jms
