<pre> Vadim Naroditsky &lt;72133.1175@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Does it mean you haven't decided or you just don't want to tell
&gt; us? BTW, out of curiosity - how old are you (at least the age
&gt; group)?

      Meaning I know but I ain't telling.

      And I'm 43.

      Funny story there...I had occasion to take a cab recently, and I
get in, and the driver is this Russian guy, medium-accent.  He looks
back, and he says, "I am trying to decide which of us is older, you or
me."  Jokingly, I suggest that it's probably me, and he says, "No, it
is probably me.  I am 52. I am guessing you are...48."

      "Actually, I'm 43," I said.

      "FORTY THREE?!" he says...and damn near drives off the road.

      I shrug.  "I've had a hard life."

      "Must be," he said, shaking his head.

                                                                  jms
