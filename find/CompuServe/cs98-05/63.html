<pre> Vadim Naroditsky &lt;72133.1175@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is it true?
&gt; Will he be in Crusades?

      It's possible that Bester would appear elsewhere, whether in a
TV movie or elsewhere, maybe even Crusade, we'll have to see.

                                                                  jms
