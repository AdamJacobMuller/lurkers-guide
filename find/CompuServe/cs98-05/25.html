<pre> Paul Weddell &lt;110213.1364@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Have you considered putting those scenes back in for the video
&gt; releases - a sort of director's cut - or were the shows that
&gt; aired exactly as you wanted them?

      No, we can't put the scenes in because it would mean a full
audio remix, which is very expensive.  The director's cut (which is
often extremely changed when John and I go in to do our version, so
you're basically getting the producer's cut from which we then cut
lines and bits) only exists on computer disk, not on film.  We'd have
to go back into the thing and that would take a massive amount of
money.

                                                                  jms
