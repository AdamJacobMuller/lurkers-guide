<H2>CC Debate: Over</H2>
<h3>Date: 06 May 1998 23:34:01 -0700</h3>
<pre>      Okay, from the beginning of the Claudia Christian departure,
I've been saying that she quit.  At the time, she said she was fired. 
And a lot of people said, "Well, we'll never really know."  This
despite all the basic facts being confirmed by both sides.

      I quote from an interview with Claudia just published in the
Summer issue of Sci Fi Invasion:

      Question: By you quitting, Straczynski lost Ivanova.  He
couldn't have been happy about that.

      Claudia: I think he feels like I put them out or something by
quitting the show, when in essence I don't really think it affected
anything.  (small snip)  I just didn't think there'd be a lot for me to
do, and I didn't want to be relegated to one more year of not having my
any challenges.

      She has finally confirmed it: I told the truth from the
beginning.  She quit.  She wasn't fired.  She quit.

      This debate is now over.

                                                                  jms
