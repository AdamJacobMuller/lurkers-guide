<H2>WB Home Video Does B5</H2>
<h3>Date: 18 May 1998 02:47:14 -0700</h3>
<pre> Michael Kalus &lt;100265.3065@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; How are you going to transport the AC-3 signal over the Channel?
&gt; Or is this for the DVD / LD release only?
&gt; IF you find a way to send it over normal ways, will it also be
&gt; available in countries outside the US?

      It's my understanding that this is one of the things that will
be facilitated by the changeover to HDTV format.  But either way, the
delivery is up to WB, we're just focusing on making it as good as we
can in this respect, so we're ready for whatever comes.

                                                                  jms
