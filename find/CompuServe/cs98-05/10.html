<pre> Kevin Kenney &lt;104102.352@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Any comment on those assertions, or at least a word on why you
&gt; won't comment on them?

      I have commented on them.  Understand that this is an ensemble
show. We have (and have had) anywhere from 11-14 regular/recurring
characters, and it is common for any number of them in a crowd that big
to feel that they are being under-utilized.  I use each of the cast
members as much as the story requires.  That's all I *can* do, because
nothing else makes sense.

                                                                  jms
