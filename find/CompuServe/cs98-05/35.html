&gt; And, as you're preparing Crusade, are you aware of an optimum
&gt; cast size, or is it that you see the story, and the story
&gt; dictates the cast size? In other words, the main difference I've
&gt; seen between B5 and other series attempting to establish long-
&gt; term storylines is that other series seem to require continuing
&gt; guest appearances -- so, how much was the larger cast size of B5
&gt; (and presumably, Crusade) dictated simply by the story you wanted
&gt; to tell or your awareness as someone experienced in TV production
&gt; of the best regular cast-size to accomplish long-term
&gt; storytelling?

      There's really no best regular size.  B5 generally had about 9-
11 regulars and recurring (i.e., in the main credits) actors in any
given season, which was necessary because you had 4 different,
competing forces, each of whom required some representation (Earth/B5,
Minbar, Narn, Centauri Prime). With an ambassador plus aide, that's 8
minimum, plus at least one or two others for station operations.

      In Crusade, we're really dealing with one force encountering
others on a per-episode basis (mostly), so we've got 6 regulars/recurs,
with a subset of reappearing characters (a la Morden, Bester or Corwin
in B5).  That feels about right to me.

                                                                  jms
