<pre> Rebecca Costello &lt;71045.3050@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Now, was that the animated "Ghostbusters" that aired back in the
&gt; eighties?

"Now, was that the animated "Ghostbusters" that aired back in the
eighties? My memories are dim because I was only maybe seven at the
time (showing my youth here) but my brother and I absolutely loved the
animated "Ghostbusters"."

      Yeah, that was my show.  I did the first network season of 13
episodes, and the syndicated season of 65 episodes...of which I wrote
something like 16 or 18 episodes.  Left it when they insisted on
changing Janine into a mommy character and knocked all the edges off
the show.

                                                                  jms
