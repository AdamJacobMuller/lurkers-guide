<h3>Date: 13 May 1998 00:34:01 -0700</h3>
<pre>      TNT has moved up the airdate for "The River of Souls" to
November 8th (from November 22nd) so that a) B5 fans won't have so long
to wait, and b) to make sure both that and Sleeping in Light both get
equal promotion, and one doesn't get lost in the other.

      Also...when the fifth season begins again from "No Compromises"
in the first week of July, it will coincide with the debut of TNT's new
satellite relay which means that the 5th season episodes will air at
the same time on both the East and West coasts (I think 8:00 p.m., I
haven't heard the final on that yet)...AND they're adding a repeat of
each new episode the same night at 11 p.m.

                                                                  jms
