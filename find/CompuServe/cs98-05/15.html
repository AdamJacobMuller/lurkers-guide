      Thanks...there's been much that was annoying in the online
conversation, but more that was positive and enjoyable, and in the long
run, that's what matters.  I don't regret having made the decision to
stick with it and stay accessible.  It's been a trial, no mistake...but
I'm glad I did it.

                                                                  jms
