<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: 26-Nov-95  22:23:25</h3>
<pre>&lt;Of the many excellent episodes you've written, this one's the best so far. It
left me thinking over its themes long after the show had ended.&gt;

     Thanks.  That's really the intent; to get people to talk about the issues
raised, and to examine the issues.  We won't tell you what to think about an
issue, because I don't have an answer myself...but if it made you stop and
consider this stuff, and decide for yourself where you fall in the discussion,
then it's done its job.

                                                                       jms
