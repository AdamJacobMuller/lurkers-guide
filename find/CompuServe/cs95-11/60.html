<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: 17-Nov-95  22:58:10</h3>
<pre>      There can be no question that the conditions prevalent in Germany after
WW I created the climate in which a Hitler could come into power. There was
great resentment and anger festering over the onerous conditions placed upon
the German government, the enconomy was in ruins, people were looking for
someone to blame, and that creates the perfect condition for scapegoats, and
someone who can take advantage of that.

      Hitler, however, was able to perceive that, galvanize it, shape it and
form it.  It was Hitler who organized the brownshirts and created the
krystalnachts, who orchestrated his rise within the government until he was
finally able to seize the reins of government, and he who was the primary
architect of the atrocities of that period.

     Of course he didn't do it by himself; there were those who willingly, even
happily collaborated; those who opposed and said nothing; those who were of no
opinion one way or another; and those who resisted.  If you're going to blame
the first group, maybe the first two or three, you still have to recognize the
fourth.

     People can be driven by the madness of the crowd, or intimidated by the
government of the gun into silence.  No one is looking to totally exonerate the
citizenry; though one can make a compelling argument that anyone who spoke out

was swiftly arrested, deported, or shot...which tends to discourage the free
exchange of criticism.  Would WW 2 have taken place without Hitler?  Possibly;
the conditions were right.  Would it have taken the same shape?  Probably not;
almost certainly not.  Thus the blame for *this* war, the way it happened
*this* time, must be laid at his feet.

                                                                       jms
