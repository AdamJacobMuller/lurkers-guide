<pre>&lt;I'm sure you will have no end of congrats on a really fantastic season's 
end.  I thought the last show with Jack the Ripper's narration was the 
crowning touch of that show, and now I see this.&gt;

     Thank you.  The emotions the show stirs up are, to me, central to the 
whole point of doing it.  We can't afford to pull any punches, or the story
falls by the wayside.  It's an *incredibly* difficult show to do, on every
level, from writing through acting to production and everything that
follows.  But when it works, and people notice, it's all worthwhile.  
Thanks again.

                                                                       jms
