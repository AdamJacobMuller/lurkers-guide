<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: November 01, 1995 7:30:04 PM</h3>
<pre>     From a strictly logical standpoint, a president would not lower 
himself to deal with this personally.  When MacArthur and Patton earned
the disfavor of the president, it was intermediaries who pulled them aside
and registered this.  Also, gradually more authority if being vested in
Nightwatch and the Ministry of Peace, as that's his arm, and so he'd be
inclined to use that since he's in most direct control.  (Just to explain
why what was done was done.)
