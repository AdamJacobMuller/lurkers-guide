<pre>&lt;You're right re: the joint chiefs.  It would be nice to see the formal 
military chain of command in operation every now and then, one of the 
things STNG did rather nicely.  
One can only hope that Sheridan verified the JCS instructions off-line out 
of the camera's all seeing eye.&gt;

     And the really great thing is...you're quite right about verifying 
orders from one arm of the government with another...as we'll see in the 
first third of the coming season.  Good call.

                                                                       jms
