<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: 25-Nov-95  23:01:30</h3>
<pre>&lt;Sheridan is being set up as a major savior figure, just like Talia was.&gt;

     Thanks.  And for "pulling a Talia" on Sheridan, that's one of the major
benefits in *doing* the Talia thing to begin with; it makes it very difficult
to sit back and accept that any character is going to be the key out of this
story.

     Agree on the new bumper; and the 5 fades in like a shadow vessel, making
it even more ominous.

                                                                       jms
