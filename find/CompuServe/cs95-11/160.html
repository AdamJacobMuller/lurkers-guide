<pre>&lt;In so many ways, you
remind me of Serling and Lovecraft.  Both strove with the gods and the devils
to produce the best, to tell the story, to turn the word on its ear, to tweek
the medium for all it could give, and then one more tweek.  There's another
Lovecraftian aspect to you, beyond the story-telling word, its this enormous
virtual circle of correspondents that you talk to each day.  Lovecraft had his
circle which nutured the likes of de Camp, Long, Howard, and Derleth.  I wonder
who out there in the ether is taking form as a writer by drawing nurishment
from this circle?&gt;

      I don't think there can *be* any praise higher than to be included in the
same sentence as Serling.  Of my personal pantheon of writers, he's right up
there at the top.  And yeah, we've had to fight the same battles to get our
respective shows on the air, with the integrity we feel/felt was required for
the story.  But in the long run, the fight is worth it if it produces something
that lasts.

      About correspondents...I've heard from a number of folks, in the course
of this prolonged conversation, who say they've had the courage to begin
writing, or sending out what they write, because they've seen that it Can Be
Done.  A few of them have broken through, most have not, but it's a long
process, and there's plenty of time ahead.

     If the show can inspire anyone, even one person, to do more, or better,
then it has achieved its purpose.

                                                                       jms
