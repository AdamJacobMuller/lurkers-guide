<H2>B5 at LosCon</H2>
<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: 23-Nov-95  01:27:19</h3>
<pre>     Just a reminder...I'll be giving a Babylon 5 special presentation at
LosCon this Sunday at the Burbank Airport Hilton from 1-3 p.m.  As a caveat,
the seats are usually gone very fast, almost always before the presentation
begins, so you may want to come a little bit early, otherwise there might not
be any available seats.  The last several appearances have all been SRO.

                                                                       jms
