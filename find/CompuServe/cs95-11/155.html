<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: 29-Nov-95  15:23:55</h3>
<pre>     No, absolutely not true.  ABC is doing a series called "Hypernauts" for
Saturday morning kidvid -- live action plus cgi -- made by many of the same
people who do B5, including Ron Thornton/Foundation Imaging, with Kevin Cremin,
John Copeland, Doug Netter and many of our same directors.  But B5 has nothing
to do with it, nor do I personally.  This person has confused two different
issues/shows.
