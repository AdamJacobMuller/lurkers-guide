<pre>      One person said, "Critics are paid to be unfair."  This piece shows it.
Too much emphasis on being cute and biting, rather than discussing the merits
of the show.

      It's enlightening to see the dichotomy on the show on either side of the
Atlantic...here the critics tend to dismiss the show, or get cutsie, or deride
it...but in the UK, publications from Home Entertainment to Time Out to even
the prestigious Radio Times have lauded the show, calling it some of the best
SF of the last decade.

                                                                       jms
