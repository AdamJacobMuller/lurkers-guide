<pre>     Re: the starfury drop...this has come up before, and some of the 
better high-IQ types have said we got it right.  The fighters use
centrifugal force to be propelled *away* from the station; yes, it's at
a slight tangent, but the station is also rotating behind them, so it
isn't that severe.  The furies don't actually fire their engines until
they're a bit away from the station, using the force of the drop.

     The vectors actually work out accurately.

                                                                       jms
