<H2>2nd Babylon 5 CD?</H2>
<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: 20-Nov-95  16:53:51</h3>
<pre>      The first CD came out and has done quite well; it's in most record stores
(that can keep it in stock), so it can be ordered through your local Tower or
Wherehouse, or you can order direct from Sonic Images via their web page, or
the address given in the B5 library (#5 or #6).

                                                                       jms
