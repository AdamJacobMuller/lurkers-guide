<pre>&lt;Up until the coup, was the EA government pretty good? They seem pretty
non-intrusive.&gt;

      The EA was fairly easy going, but remember that people are used to a
heavy governmental hand during the Earth/Minbari War.  It's in a way similar to
the situation we had post WW2; the only way we could make it past that war and
survive was through strict discipline, following orders, going along with
rationing, conserving, everything.  And it was that positive attitude that
those who came later would exploit in the McCarthy/Red Scare 1950s, and hit us
sideways in the 60s.

                                                                       jms
