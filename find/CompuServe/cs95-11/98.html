<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: 22-Nov-95  00:29:34</h3>
<pre>      I just went through my stuff trying to find it...there was a formal
report published by the Government Printing Agency in around 1978 or so.  I
think it was entitled something like "Prospects for Contact by Extra-
Terrestrial Intelligence," and went into the whole CETI issue at great length.
(Back then, it was CETI, for Contact With Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence,
changed shortly after the House hearing on the subject to SETI, Search For
Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence.)  Any GPA office should have the report on
file.

                                                                       jms
