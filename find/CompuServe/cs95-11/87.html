<pre>     Because Delenn doesn't know that information offhand, any more than you or
I would have casual access to detailed scientific information from our own
world just off the top of our heads; she'd still have to go to her own
homeworld for the info, as our characters did.  And it's not that we didn't
have it, it was just collating it all.  And given how Kosh answers questions,
would you really want to use his responses in this thing?
