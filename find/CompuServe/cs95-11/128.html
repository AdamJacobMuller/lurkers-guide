<pre>&lt;So NO Silver Screen Ambitions?
What do you think about the end of SeaQuest? And how good are your
quotes (if this is the correct word for it)?&gt;

      Nope, no real interest in doing movies; it's really a director's medium,
so I prefer either television or print, which is a writer's medium.

      What do I think about the end of SeaQuest?  Well, it was kind of
inevitable, wasn't it?  If they had left it alone, in the hands of the people
who first created it, like Rockne O'Bannon, and quit pulling on it in every
possible direction, it could've been okay.  Instead, the Suits got involved,
and when the Suits get involved...you're dead.

      "How good are your quotes?"  Don't know what this means.

                                                                       jms
