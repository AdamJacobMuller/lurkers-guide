<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: November 04, 1995 12:32:10 AM</h3>
<pre>     Bear in mind that Sheridan specifically states that the treaty had 
*not* been finalized yet between Earth and the Centauri, so the attack was 
not a violation of a treaty that hadn't been signed yet.  (And very likely
the Centauri captain was unaware of it *anyway*, just as Sheridan was taken
by surprise by it all.)
