<pre>     Incorrect.  Share *is* important on the local level.  When you get the
national ratings on a syndicated program, the final figure doesn't have a
share, only a rating.  Shares come in market by market, and since the show's
future is determined market by market, that's crucial to our survival.  So for
our purposes, the share per market is *very much* the more important figure.

                                                                       jms
