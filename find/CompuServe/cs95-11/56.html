<pre>     Yeah, and that quote got me in lots of trouble; my original statement was
that we'd kick their ass, they'd kick ours, we'd kick back, and the ongoing
competition would guarantee better shows for viewers. Unfortunately they chose
to use only the first part of that...and thus was a huge fracas born.

                                                                       jms
