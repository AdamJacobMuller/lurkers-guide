<pre>&lt;Thanks for clearing that up for me. I don't doubt your word, but for
some reason I just didn't recall seeing a section of that ship rotate.&gt;

      Look at the big, round section in the middle of the Cortez, that's the
part that rotates.

                                                                       jms
