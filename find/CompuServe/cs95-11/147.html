<pre>&lt;In the episode "Convictions," why did the "bomb squad" have to go out into
space in order to gain access to the fusion reactor?&gt;

     Going in the vacuum door was the fastest way to get a bunch of people in
there, and presumably get a big object out again.  Instead of riding transport
tubes to the core shuttle, then the core shuttle to the far end, then tubes to
the bottom...you jump out, get picked up and dumped at the far end.  Takes 2
minutes rather than 10 or 15.  Remember, this place is five miles long.

                                                                       jms
