<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: November 03, 1995 5:41:22 PM</h3>
<pre>     The interceptors line refers to the fact that there are so many 
incoming bursts that the interceptors are only knocking down 90% of them at 
this point, meaning that some of them (the incoming bursts) are getting 
through.

     Janet's busy working on the scriptwriting part of her career, so she's 
not available now, but hopefully she'll be available back to us come next 
year.

     And thanks.

                                                                       jms
