<pre>      We've shown one body after spacing, and discussed another; in each case,
we hewed close to the facts.  Dr. Franklin pointed out that, rather than eyes
exploding or anything of that nature, they freeze, for instance. In any
event...yes, point taken, and we won't do that, never intended to.
