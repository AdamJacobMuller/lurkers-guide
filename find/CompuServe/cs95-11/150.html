<H2>B5 Screensaver</H2>
<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: 29-Nov-95  03:24:46</h3>
<pre>     Well, today I got my complimentary copy of the new B5 screensaver (aka the
Limited Edition CDRom Entertainment Untility), from Sound Sources.  I have to
say that I'm extremely pleased with it.  (And folks around here know that if I
don't like it, I don't front for it.)

     I have it running now on both my home computer, and my work office
computer.  On the downside, it isn't exactly intuitive on the installation, and
there's not much of a manual.  You have to figure out some stuff on your own.
(Like when it says it installs all the wallpaper, it actually installs a
portion; you then have the option of using the Install aspect to go back into
the CDrom images area and getting the 150 or so other wallpaper images and
putting them into your system, and then using the Add and Select menus to
activate them.)

     I had a memory/sound conflict on the work computer on a few of the
modules, but no such problem on the home system (and since they're both nearly
identical systems, it tells me something's wonky with one of the computers, and
I have to figure this out.)  Maybe it has something to do with running Norton
Desktop.

     Those two caveats aside, and they're relatively minor...I love it. You've
got a whole bunch of video clips complete with sounds and/or music, 150
wallpapers, bunches of .wav files, using our actual sound library from the
show, plus music clips...it's just gorgeous.  And well displayed, well put
together.  It has what I was hoping for, a sense of a piece of Babylon 5 itself
in your system.

     As I understand it, there are only going to be 100,000 of these produced
for full national distribution, and apparently the phone and mail orders are
piling up, as are computer store orders.  So you may want to get it fast when
it appears, 'cause it may not stay on the shelves very long.

     I don't like to do a lot of merchandise, and when we do, it has to be of
superior quality; this one definitely qualifies.

                                                                       jms
