<H2> Londo Talk From TLTS		</H2>
<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: November 02, 1995 10:55:12 PM</h3>
<pre>     &lt;G'kar says "There is no greater power in the universe than the need 
for freedom."  At "need," Londo blinks, and as G'kar says "freedom", Londo
turns his head slightly to his right and I could have sworn he silently
says  "Yes...",  out of the corner of his mouth.  Was this my imagination?&gt;

     It was your imagination.
