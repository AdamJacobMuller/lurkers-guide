<pre>&lt;Delenn really made Sebastian realize who HE was as well.  Was this
both-sides-of-the-coin intentional, or just happy happenstance?&gt;

     No, it was very much intentional; Sebastian learns quite a bit in the 
course of that encounter about himself...especially when she rubs it in his 
face as she does.

                                                                       jms
