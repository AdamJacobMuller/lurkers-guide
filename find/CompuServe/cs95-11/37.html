<pre>     Actually, I think I saw more *annoyance* at Jack being used from the 
UK folks than the US folks, that's the main difference, I think.  
Probably because it's a peaceful, wonderful country which is *still* paying 
off, in the public eye, one particularly nasty creature in their recent 
history. They're probably tired of hearing about him, and to some extent,
correctly so.
