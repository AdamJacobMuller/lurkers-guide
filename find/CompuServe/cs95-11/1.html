<pre>     So, in other words, if a historical, real character has been used in 
some other venue, if the use of that same character in another, 
wholly different world/series/show/universe is absolutely, totally and 
completely the right thing for that story, 
one should instead do what's *wrong* for the story and leave it out?

     Sorry.  Don't buy it.

                                                                       jms
