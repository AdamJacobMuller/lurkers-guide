<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: 30-Nov-95  01:44:13</h3>
<pre>&lt;I feel safe in saying that
your career is starting to closely parallel all the good aspects of Mr.
Serling's career (and no, no jokes about doing Schlitz commercials after B5
ends).  I don't think I'll be contradicted - especially in light of tonights
show - in saying that, when the statues start going up, yours and his will be
standing beside one another.&gt;

      Wow, that's three...I'm about ready to fall down.  High praise indeed.

      Wasn't on the special because, basically, I wasn't asked.  Haven't yet
seen it, but have the thing on tape, and will look at it later tonight.

                                                                       jms
