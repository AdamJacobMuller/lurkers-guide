<pre>&lt;Is a 500,000 megaton explosion enough to devastate a *planet*?&gt;

     No, it probably couldn't take out a planet, though it'd sure disrupt all
communications in and out for a long time, maybe throw up a dust curtain to
bring down the temperature quite a bit.  Certainly it'd debilitate the planet
long enough for additional probes to be sent in.  If one can do the job, one
does the job; if more are required, more are sent.

                                                                       jms
