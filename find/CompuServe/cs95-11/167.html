<pre>     The third Serling story isn't so much strange, as were the other two, but
interesting, in that after that one first encounter with him, when I was
working on the new Twilight Zone series, they found an outline by Serling that
he had never put into script form...and they asked me to do the script based on
that outline, so here, twent-some years later, I ended up sharing a writing
credit with Serling on "Our Selena is Dying."  A collaboration, much after the
fact.

                                                                       jms
