<pre>      Thanks.  This is kinda what I always said...if folks will give us just a
fair chance, no more, no less, we'll back up the talk with action, and with
stories.

      You're to be commended for giving us a second chance, and posting this.
Thanks for giving us the opportunity.

                                                                       jms
