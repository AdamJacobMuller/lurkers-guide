<pre>     Unfortunately, for some reason my brain's hard-wired for typing.  
I've tried dictating in the past, to a tape recorder, but nothing comes out 
as crisp or as *right* unless I'm at the keyboard and my fingers are 
thinking for me.

                                                                       jms
