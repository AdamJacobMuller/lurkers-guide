<pre>     Londo does not specify Sinclair in his dialogue; that's the picture at
that moment, but that doesn't lock us into it.

     A full explanation for what happened and why is uploaded in the library
here; do a search in lib 5, I think, for Sinclair, and you'll find it. (Rather
than recap the whole thing again here.)

                                                                       jms
