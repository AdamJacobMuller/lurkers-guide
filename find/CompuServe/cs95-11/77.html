<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: 20-Nov-95  01:03:45</h3>
<pre>     My sense is that if you're a german ambassador, and you're attacked and
checked into Cedar Sinai Hospital, the chief of staff there takes care of you,
rather than bringing in an outsider/german doctor.  Franklin's well suited to
his task.

     We could probably label the blood bags a little better.

                                                                       jms
