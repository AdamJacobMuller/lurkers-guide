<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: 29-Nov-95  15:23:57</h3>
<pre>      What we're doing in the meantime is plenty.  Originally, the fourth and
final episode in this first batch of four was going to be "Voices of
Authority," which deals with just this question of preparing for the war in a
big way, has major developments, gets into the White Star...but the CGI
requirements of that episode were hideous, so we had to move it to #5 in the
lineup, moving up "Gethsemane."  Once we come back with new episodes, we'll hit
the ground running hard on all this stuff.

     Also bear in mind that wars aren't instant; in the real world, you have to
line up support, get into alliances, move all your pieces around before you can
get into it.  We're taking a similar path here.  Also, the term "shadow war"
refers to more than just the shadows as a race; they refer to what's going on
back on earth as well, as metaphor as well as plot point, and that's a huge
part of the next batch of eps.
