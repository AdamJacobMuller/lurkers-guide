<pre>      Had a Minbari been running that sensor, he would've nailed it instantly;
but Ivanova had never actually encountered that ship before, and was running
off the initial scan reports.  (Also it was just phasing in at that point.)

      The White Star uses local drive engines based on magnetic and
gravitational principles; in a sense, it doesn't so much push itself toward
other worlds as *pull* itself or *repel* itself.  One side effect of creating a
powerful gravitational system is the ability to create artificial gravity.

      That's my story and I'm sticking to it.

                                                                       jms
