<pre>     Some stations are shifting to less terrific timeslots; other stations are
giving us *better* timeslots.  There's no one trend.  The main problem is that
each market only has maybe one or two indie stations max, and if that's a Fox
or UPN station, you've only got 2 prime time hours per night available 8-10
(nearly all of these show their news programs at 10 p.m.). So first precedence
for those 14 hours per week is given to Fox or UPN programs (or WB programs,
depending), plus all the other syndicated shows out there, from talk shows to
game shows and so on.

     The market for syndicated shows, and where you can squeeze them in, is
getting increasingly smaller.  Hence the growth of cable.

                                                                       jms
