<pre>     There's also a certain amount of McCarthyism inherent in the 
Nightwatch, the emphasis on revealing spies in our midst, enemies of the 
people.

     The problem with pointing to the Nazis or the Gestapo exclusively is 
that it allows us the safety of saying, "Well, it happened just there, and 
only once, *we* could never fall for that."

     Wrong.

                                                                       jms
