<pre>     "it just didn't pay off in the long run."  For you.  For others it 
did. Let's not start getting grandiose.  You feel this way, that's fine,
but it's not the ultimate truth.  Otherwise you're totally dismissing the
opinions of others who liked it a lot.

     "Jack...has become a real cliche."  So because others have used that 
figure in their work, well or poorly, no one should ever use this 
historical figure ever again in the next thousand years of human history.  
One should not do what one thinks is right for a story because of what 
someone else did in a different story.

     Sorry.  I don't work that way.  By your logic, I should not be using 
starships or hyperspace or aliens, either, because they've been used a LOT 
more than Jack.

                                                                       jms
