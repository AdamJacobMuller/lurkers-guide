<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: 22-Nov-95  22:33:13</h3>
<pre>      To have a Tie fighter come through B5 space would a) break the reality of
the show, b) make us a pastiche or comedy, people would be too busy noticing
and laughing at that to pay attention, and b) would be a case of copyright
infringement, which would get us in a heap of legal trouble.

      Re: the ratings...you're quite correct.  Also, what most folks forget was
that TOS was considered a ratings flop on every level, and would've been
canceled after its second year were it not for a huge campaign by fans.

                                                                       jms
