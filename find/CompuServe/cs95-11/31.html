<pre>     The thing about the Kinesis is that for the first week I was using it, 
my arms and wrists *really* hurt.  I thought, "This CAN'T be right."  
I looked in the manual, and found it said approximately "For the first week 
your wrists and arms will hurt."  Oh.  Then you get used to it.

     Overall, I've gotten quite proficient with it, and the typing speed 
hasn't diminished.  There are a few things that could've been done better, 
but overall it's a definite improvement.  (Main problem is that I have
rather long, slender fingers, so I often over-shoot the keys unless I'm
paying attention.)

                                                                       jms
