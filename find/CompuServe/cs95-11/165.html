<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: 30-Nov-95  04:55:54</h3>
<pre>&lt;Now that you've finally been able to use the story of a mind-wiped criminal
learning of his past, can you say something about how different the story would
have been had you been able to do it in the first (?) season as you had
originally planned?&gt;

      No, no nod to the person who suggested it, since this isn't a
competition, and the suggestion cost me a year where I couldn't do the story.
(So I wasn't in the cutest frame of mind about this for a long time, even
though it wasn't really his fault.)

     Basically, it would've been a one-shot, with two monks arriving to scope
out B5 for the arrival of the rest later on.  (You'll notice that none of the
other monks get into the story here; that's a hold-over from the original
outline, which I saw no need to change at this point.)  So this would've been
folded into an introduction to the order as they come to check out B5's
facilities.

                                                                       jms
