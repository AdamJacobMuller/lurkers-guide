<pre>     Sacrificing oneself happens frequently...but for just one other 
person, AND in a situation where no one else would ever know about it.  
Bear in mind that he wasn't testing people randomly; only those who felt 
that they were chosen of god, fulfillers of prophecy...people who assumed 
that they were part of some grand scheme, and thus to whom an anonymous
death is an intolerable thought.

     Also, most probably never *got* that far, unable to stand the real 
pain of being placed in this position.  Everybody can talk the talk; very
few can walk the walk.  Most probably just yanked off the bracelets and
split, on the theory that they weren't being sufficiently coddled or
glorified...or because being a potential prophet isn't as much fun as
they'd thought.

                                                                       jms
