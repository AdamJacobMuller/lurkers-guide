<pre>      "It doesn't fit in with the way the Vorlons have been portrayed.  It 
bothered me."

      Good.  That was the intended result.

      Part of the reason for the story was to grey up the Vorlons a little; 
one shouldn't fall too easily for what other people *say* they are.

      (One might also say much the same of the old testament god who would 
have Job so severely tested, btw.)

       One should always be cautious of taking *anyone* at face value on B5.

      "...you could consider them a force for good."

      Ah, but what *is* good?  And whose *version* of good are we 
discussing?

                                                                       jms
