<pre>&lt;When the brother died I blew my nose and thought it was over, but then you
bring the "new" brother to Sheridan and there I go again.  Really, it was an
almost cruel use of beauty.  Of course until the gill scene.  Eck.&gt;

      "...a cruel use of beauty."  What a great way to phrase it.  Never heard
that before.  Thanks.
