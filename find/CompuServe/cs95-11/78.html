<pre>     "...that would mean that it would be near the bottom of the ratings of
syndicated shows."

     People who don't know what they're talking about should avoid making
comments like that.  The overall breakdown of syndicated shows runs about 10
pages of very fine type; usually around 215 shows or more, ranked in order of
average national ratings.  Babylon 5 is always on the first page of that
breakdown; usually the #4 or #5 dramatic series for that week, sometimes a bit
higher, never less than #6.  We consistently stay in the top ten of dramatic
series.  (You don't include game shows or talk shows in the mix; that's
comparing apples and oranges.)

      If you *include* all those other shows, in one typical week, we came out
as #38 overall, out of 215.  That is extremely respectable.  Most network shows
that come in around the top 50 tend to stay around for a good long time.

     Look, Peter, do me a favor, and get off the ratings, okay?  It's clear you
don't understand them, and the bottom line is simply this: if our ratings
weren't sufficiently high, we wouldn't be here.  It's that simple. We're here,
so we're getting the numbers.  Warners is happy, and we're happy.

                                                                       jms
