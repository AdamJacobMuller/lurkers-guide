<pre>     Well, I have a number of feelings about this.  First, you'll note that 
it's always an alien that has something "different" than the ST normal male 
or female character...we had the aliens who were all unisexual in TNG, now 
this.  And, of course, it wasn't *really* two women falling in love, it was 
someone who was once a male, now in a female body, carrying on with that 
relationship.  So there are a lot of ways out of this.

     I also think they somewhat played it for the prurient interest factor; 
we just did it, by developing a relationship over time, and when it came to 
fruition, we didn't make a big deal about it, it's just normal and 
accepted. And it was between two *human* characters.  It's personal taste,
I suppose; I just prefered it the way we did it.  Doesn't make it better or
righter.

     We developed a growing relationship between Talia and Ivanova over two 
whole seasons; paid it off, and there will be ramifications down the road 
from this relationship.  Because it *is* a relationship in that sense, not
just done for one hour, for sensationalism, and then you drop it thereafter.

                                                                       jms
