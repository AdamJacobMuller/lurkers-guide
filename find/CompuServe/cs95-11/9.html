<pre>     Re: "tennis wrists," or carpal tunnel syndrome...yes, I've got it in 
spades.  I have to use the CTS gloves constantly or the arms ache badly
within a matter of minutes; and even then they only slow down the speed
with which they begin to hurt.  As it is, there's a dull ache pretty much
all day, and most of the night; and after enough writing, my ring fingers
on either hand start curling in, and my forefingers get a bit numb.  
Toward the end of last season, the only way I could write was to write for 
30 minutes, ice down my arms for 10 minutes, write for 30, ice for 10, and 
so on.

     No matter what precautions you take, when you write sometimes as much 
as 20 pages per day...it's gonna happen.

     (General note: I've seen virtually every article on CTS, I know about 
the vitamins, the wrist-rests, the exercises, all that; I do what I can
with those things that help.  So while advice is appreciated, it's not
necessary in this case.)

                                                                       jms
