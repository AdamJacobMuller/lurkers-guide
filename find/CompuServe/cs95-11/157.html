<pre>&lt;Do you believe fiction writing can be taught?&gt;

     The answer is yes and no.  I've taught writing classes and workshops, and
it is entirely possible to take someone with a good command of the language and
make them publishable in the area of articles and other nonfiction.  Virtually
anyone can be trained.  You can also learn some of the basic *techniques* of
fiction.  But there's a quantum jump between what is required of the two basic
forms.

     By the time I was done, invariably people would sell in non-fiction. The
last time I did it, within 6 months of finishing the class, the percentage of
those who actually pursued it (as opposed to just dropping the ball and not
trying) and published was close to 100%.  Fiction, ah, that's different.

     When it comes time to make up your own stories, you either hear the music,
or you don't.  (And even if you don't, some folks can sell one or two items in
their lives.)

     That spark, that way of viewing the world and coming up with stories,
cannot be taught I think.  It's either there, or it ain't.

                                                                       jms
