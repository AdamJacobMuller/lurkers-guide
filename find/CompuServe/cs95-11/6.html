<pre>&lt;IT DOESN'T MATTER.  THIS PLACE HAS BEEN BLESSED.
   Wow!!  I expected this to devolve into a bitter argument
   between different religions.&gt;

     Thanks.  I think that, with so many races around, you couldn't go into 
holy wars or jihads at every occasion.  In a 
way, what was seen was a validation for many...a moment they all came 
together, instead of coming apart.

                                                                       jms
