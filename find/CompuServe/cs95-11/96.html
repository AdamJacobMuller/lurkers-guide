<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: 21-Nov-95  21:42:38</h3>
<pre>      Two things on the upcoming episode ("Gethsemane")....

      1) This is episode #5 in shooting order; I'd originally planned to end
the first batch of new episodes with #4, "Voices of Authority," which is a
major -- and I mean major -- wham episode.  But the EFX requirements were
pretty hideous (though not as bad as "Messages"), so I moved "Gethsemane" into
that slot, which is a very strong episode, though not an arc'er.

      2) On the story question...yes, this was the story that someone else
(don't want to use names, no sense in blaming anyone) had accidentally
suggested while I was working on it early in season two.  So I had to scuttle
the script for nearly a year.  Finally, very chagrined over what happened, the
individual gave me a notarized form explaining the situation. At that point, I
was able to reactivate the story.  So no, it's not any kind of "it's okay to do
this" notion about story ideas; as it is, the story was tied up for about a
year, and might never have seen the light of day had not the other person made
great efforts to set the situation straight.

                                                                       jms
