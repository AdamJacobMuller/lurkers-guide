<pre>     "Good is the absence of evil...."

     Is it?  Is it the *absence* or the *opposite*?

     One might say (to take a christian pov for a moment) that god is the
absence of evil.  But is this the case?  Is evil a thing, or is evil the
potentiality to do acts of wanton destruction?

     At what point did evil come into the universe, from this pov?  With the
fall of Lucifer?  But unless the *potential* for evil existed before this
act of pride, it would be impossible for Lucifer to fall.  The very tenet of
free will is that there are choices to be made.  If there are no choices,
there is no free will, quid pro quo.  Hence, in the garden, the *potential*
for evil existed before an *act* later described as evil or rebellious.

     And, hence, the *potential* for evil existed before Lucifer fell.  If
it had not, he couldn't have fallen.  (Also, if one takes the position that
the fall *created* evil, then a fallen angel has creative potential, which
puts it at an unacceptably high level of power.)

     It says in the book of Amos, "Is there evil in a city and the Lord hath
not done it?"

     If the potential for evil was there from the dawn of creation -- and it
*must* have been for the actions described later to have taken place -- then
there must perforce be the potential for evil in its creator.  (Unless one
is willing to posit that in not having the potential for evil, god does not
have free will, which means god is not omnipotent, and somehow gifted his
creations with a capacity he himself was incapable of.) This doesn't mean,
and shouldn't be taken to imply, that god *is* evil, or *has* evil, but
rather that the *potential* is there, and has always existed.

     Thus, good is not the *absence* of evil, but the *opposition* to evil.
To use Mark Twain's example in "The Man Who Corrupted Hadleyburg," you had
an entire town that had never known temptation, and held itself up as
righteous...  until the first day when real temptation walked in the front
door, and the whole place fell for it...after which the sign out front of
the town was modified to read "Lead us INTO temptation," for only through
temptation, through the exposure to evil, is faith and the good tested and
made viable.
