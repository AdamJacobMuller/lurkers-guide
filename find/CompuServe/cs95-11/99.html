<pre>      Of course it's your right to say it.  You can say any foolish thing you
choose.  My point -- underlined by your own comments -- is that you have
absolutely no understanding of how the ratings work, where they come from, how
they are compiled, what they mean, or where we stand in those rankings.

     If you wish to continue putting out misinformation, botched figures,
unnecessary panic, and foolish notions that have nothing whatsoever to do with
reality, well, that's your right.  And I'm going to call you on it and if your
comments are sufficiently stupid or misinformed, get a little testy, because
that's *my* right.  I came back and posted the exact numbers that are made
available.  It's not playing the ratings game except in the sense that the
ratings are always a game...a game whose rules you don't know or understand.

     For the week of 10/23 to 10/29, we were ranked #38 overall, out of a grand
total of 220 syndicated television series, including game shows, talk shows,
dramas, comedies, and everything else, and the 6th rated dramatic series for
that week.  And our demographics scores put us in around 2nd/3rd position.  We
did better than Highlander, Pointman, Kung Fu, the syndicated Tales from the
Crypt, and other dramatic series.  Outside dramatic series, we did better than
the Jerry Springer Show, America's Most Wanted, Sightings, Martha Stewart
Living, Rush Limbaugh, Siskel &amp; Ebert, Richard Bey, and Donahue...all of which
are considered successful series.

     Those are the cold, hard facts, the hard numbers as delivered the the A.C.
Neilsen and Arbitron Companies.

     If I were currently worried about the show, if I thought the numbers were
soft, I'd be the first person sounding the clarion call and asking people to
write letters urging the show's continuance.  I'm not doing that, because
Warner Bros. is happy, PTEN is happy, and we're happy.  No one -- *no one* --
is more concerned about this show's survival than I am, and if I'm relatively
content with the situation, then we're in pretty good shape.

     You cite that some stations are moving the show into weird hours.  That is
correct.  First, it's only a very few stations out of nearly 200 stations;
those are, for the most part, Fox stations that have contractual commitments to
run Fox shows in prime-time, which is 8-10 p.m. Mon-Sun (they generally run
news 10-11).  All that's left in those stations -- and many markets only *have*
one or two independent stations -- is the non-prime time schedule.  That means
after 11 or before 7.

     You cite the Indianapolis station that dropped the show.  Yes, because WB,
feeling strongly about the show, pressured it for a better time slot, same as
in Grand Rapids MI.  They were locked in, couldn't give us anything better, so
the show left...and has not been REPLACED in the Indianapolis market on WNDY.
So once again your facts are incorrect by omission and
inaccuracy...Indianapolis DOES have B5 back now, on better station in many
ways, and we're in negotiations to bring it back to the two or three other
markets where the same thing has happened.

     In all the major markets, our ratings are *significantly* up.  In
Charlotte we're up 186% over this same time last year; Cincinnati up 233%;
Chicago up 133%; San Francisco up 135%...in Portland we blow the doors off
altogether.

     In short, Peter, you are absolutely, incontravertibly, dead-ass wrong.

     "I am only doing a favor to those out there who like the show."  No you're
not.  You're trying to whip up hysteria, get people upset, cause a crisis that
exists nowhere but in your own mind, because that's what you enjoy doing.

     And you clearly think that while you can come on here and say any thing
you want, if I come back and say you're wrong, somehow this is wrong, this is
only wanting to hear from groupies...as opposed to the simple fact that you're
*wrong*.  You want to have one set of rules for yourself (anything goes), and
one thing for me (shut up, bend over and take it without any backtalk).  I
checked my CIS agreement; that proviso isn't there.

     Anybody who comes on here and wants to express an opinion, negative or
positive, about the show is free to do so.  Anyone who comes on and offers what
he thinks are facts, and those facts are wrong, is going to be corrected.

     There is this little club of people who think that they should be able to
say anything they want, as addle-headed or inaccurate as may be, and that if
they're called on it, that's wrong, and that's interfering in their right of
expression.  Well, pal, I have a right to expression too, and guess what? The
facts are on my side of the argument, not yours.

     And they always come back with the same thing, "if it bothers you to hear
it, well, that's just the way things are," and "I am not some groupie or some
mindless fanatic," thereby denigrating everybody else, as if they are blind
followers, and only you see the truth, which is I'm sure exactly what you would
like to believe, and "you might not like to hear it, but I got a right to say
it."

     Absolutely.  You've got a right to be as asinine and incorrect and stupid
and ill-informed and prejudicial and hysterical and wrong-headed as you wish.

     And I've got the right to correct you.

     Deal with it.

                                                                       jms
