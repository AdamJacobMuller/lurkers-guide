<pre>     Yeah, this is the other structure that's kind of a favorite of mine.  
I used it also in "Coming of Shadows."  It starts out kind of slow, it
lulls you into a sense that this is going to be a fairly ordinary story,
nothing major...allowing me to sneak up behind you in the story and just
*whack* you real hard when you're not expecting it.

                                                                       jms
