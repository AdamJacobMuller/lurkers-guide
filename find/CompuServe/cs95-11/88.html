<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: 20-Nov-95  21:38:28</h3>
<pre>      My sense is that Delenn is not a godlike font of information; I don't
think anyone, alien or human, at the station would just happen to know all the
information required.  How much would Delenn know about molecular biology, for
instance?  (And if you asked Kosh a question about the subject, he'd probably
come back with "The heart does not sing with its parts."  Not exactly useful.)

     Anyone there would have to go back to their own world for experts in the
various fields...so you're back where you started.  Earth *has* the info, it's
just getting it, and getting it fast.  If you add the overlay of going through
another government, you're going to run out of time that much faster.

     Logically, a probe like this would be sent off looking for information on
the very cusp of technology that could pose a threat.  That's why it *didn't*
go off when the probe presumed them to be a less developed civilization; it was
looking for civilizations that *are* sufficiently advanced to pose a possible
threat; Sheridan says exactly that as he walks across C&amp;C.

     Interesting aside on this, btw, in the "where do you get your ideas?"
department.  The US House Science Sub-Committee held a series of hearings into
the question of extraterrestrial contact during the 1970s, to determine what we
should do in the event of contact.  The most likely scenario, the scientists
agreed, was a probe coming into our solar system.  So what do we do in response
to a message asking if anybody's home?

     Believe it or not, it was the consensus of the Subcommittee that we should
not respond...in case it was a berserker, just as shown in the episode.  That
is our government's official policy on the subject.

                                                                       jms
