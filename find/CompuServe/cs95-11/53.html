<pre>      The question, of course, is...is a person 100% dark or light?  Hitler was
a monster.  He was also a snappy dresser and, to quote The Producers, he could
dance the pants off Churchill.  Look at the war films from WW 2 behind the
scenes...there's Goebbels and Goering and others having dinner, laughing,
playing little jokes, listening to music....

      The monster never sees a monster in a mirror.
