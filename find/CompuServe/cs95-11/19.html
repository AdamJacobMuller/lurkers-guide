<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: November 01, 1995 11:20:02 PM</h3>
<pre>&lt;I was looking through the book and saw a picture that was the same yet not. 
 It's the picture with Kosh, G'Kar, Delenn and Londo standing in front of a 
large fan.  
In the LE CD, Londo looks like he's just been through a month of binge 
drinking.  His face is splotchy and his hair is a rats nest.  In the GR CD, 
he just looks pained.&gt;

      You caught me.  In the limited, they used a photo that I absolutely 
*hate*, for what it does to Londo's hair.  So when the general release was
due to come out, they couldn't change the photo, too expensive, so I had
them put a different head on it.

                                                                       jms
