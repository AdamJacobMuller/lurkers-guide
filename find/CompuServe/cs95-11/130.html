<pre>     "Either answer in a polite way, or don't answer at all."

     Peter, you came in here and started acting like a jerk.  Everyone here
feels exactly the same way about your behavior.  I don't have to be polite if
you're acting like a jerk; neither does anyone else here.  Around here, you get
what you give; if you are polite, and respectful, others will treat you the
same way.  If you come in here, guns blazing, acting like a ditz, then people
are gonna call you a ditz.  Polite ain't got nothin' to do with it.  Take a
little personal responsibility for your behavior.

                                                                       jms
