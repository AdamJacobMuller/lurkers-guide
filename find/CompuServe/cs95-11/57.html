<pre>     Londo and G'Kar no longer really have much to discuss; they're past that
point, I figure.  They hate each other.

     Re: the Drazi...yeah, I hear that a lot.  The most frequent comment: "I
like the Drazi; they're just nuts."

     Londo wasn't on Minbar; he was seeing someone off on a ship going to
Centauri Prime.
