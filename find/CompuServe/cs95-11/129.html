<pre>&lt;I've been puzzling in my mind ever since "And Now for a Word," what is John
Sheridan's middle name?  And did you work on Space Rangers?&gt;

     Eek!   I had nothing to do with "Space Rangers," feh, feh, a pox, no. We
went on with our pilots in similar periods, but no, I ain't had nothin' to do
with that one ever.

     I have two options of what the J stands for; still trying to decide
between historical reference and personal satisfaction.

                                                                       jms
