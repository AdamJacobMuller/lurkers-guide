<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: 21-Nov-95  00:20:33</h3>
<pre>       That's a lot of questions, but still....

       I'll go along with little increases in merchandising along the way, but
nothing major until after we're done.  Then, when it can't contaminate the
show, maybe more.

       Talia and Ivanova were linked/did have a relationship; and there was a
camera edit that didn't quite match, two different issues.

       A book after the fact...will have to wait until I'm done for a decision.
We hope the show will in time be out on tape/disk, and all of the major
questions raised during the show should/must be answered during the show, you
can't leave stuff hanging.

                                                                       jms
