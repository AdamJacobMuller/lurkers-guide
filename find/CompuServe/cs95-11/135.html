<pre>&lt;And Londo's comment "It's nothing personal, Vir" after his appalling
conversation with Na'Far brought chills with its echo of the bomber's speech
last episode.&gt;

     Thanks.  Yeah, "it's nothing personal" does echo the other theme; those

                                                                       jms
