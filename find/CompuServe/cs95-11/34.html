<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: November 02, 1995 11:11:11 PM</h3>
<pre>     I think I wasn't clear...the Lennier/Kosh scene *was* filmed; it just 
didn't make it into the final cut of the episode.

     In general, we leave 2-3 minutes per episode on the cutting room 
floor, for various reasons...pacing, structure, whatever.  Usually it's
just line cutting, sometimes it's a small, quick scene here and there.

                                                                       jms
