<pre>      Thank you.  I don't think it's a case of hanging out with "the commoners"
to use your term; I've been here since 1984 or so, and I enjoy the discussions,
and I'll be darned if I'll change that just because my name appears on a TV
screen somewhere.  I'm basically just another fan of the genre....

                                                                       jms



</PRE>
