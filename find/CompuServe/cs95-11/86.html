<pre>     We've been working with WB on getting the paperwork finished, and it's
nearly there, so the club should be on line in the next week or two.  I'm
directly involved in running/owning it, with my associate Doug Netter.  It's
not set up to be a big money machine, just doing a few things for the fans, and
that sort of thing.

                                                                       jms
