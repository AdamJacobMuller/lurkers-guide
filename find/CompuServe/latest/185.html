<pre> Richard M Perry &lt;76461.2737@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Keep the website, or maybe expand it; I'd love to have and e-mail
&gt; address at like rmperry@thestation.com, how cool would that be? 
&gt; (of the tail wagging the dog) I wonder how the member discount
&gt; will work if there isn't a formal membership? How much pain are we
&gt; willing to suffer? into death?"

      I appreciate all of that...at the same time, however, what you
suggest would mean, in a sense, taking advantage of the fans to some
extent, charging for not getting much, and a) I can't do that, and b) I
think the majority, however attached to the show, would not want that
situation.

      In time, if we can get the thing into the black, we will
certainly revisit the structure of the thing and see what can be done
at that time.

                                                                  jms
