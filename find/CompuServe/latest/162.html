"If Warner Bros. really believes in the future of Crusade, then why
don't they just save the show themselves and put it on the WB Network?"

      Because there IS no one Warner Bros.  It was constructed as a
series of competing and structurally independent fiefdoms...WB Domestic
TV competes with the WB Network and so on.  Each division actively
competes and to a large degree won't *cooperate* with other divisions. 
A network also wants its own stamp on the development process, so they
simply wouldn't take another show they didn't develop, from a competing
division.

                                                                  jms
