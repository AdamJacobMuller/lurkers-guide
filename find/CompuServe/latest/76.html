<pre> Roberto Micheri &lt;102701.435@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Are there any more materials on Crusade coming out?
&gt; Comics?
&gt; Have you considerd continuing the story as a series of books?

      I just finished reviewing his sountrack CD demo, and I like it. 
I think it'll go over well.

"Are there any more materials on Crusade coming out?  Comics?
Cards....  Have you considerd continuing the story as a series of
books?  The Del Rey publications have been nice."

      The technomage trilogy follows Galen through his training,
becoming a full-fledged technomage, through the shadow war exodus, and
into the events of Crusade...and the Centauri trilogy also gets into a
lot of Crusade territory, both trilogies involving a secret behind
Galen's involvement in our story.

                                                                  jms
