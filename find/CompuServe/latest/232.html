<pre> Richard M Perry &lt;76461.2737@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; (I already booked a room at the Marriott) Is there any chance
&gt; that Top Cow, or Harlan, will be dragging you along with them
&gt; this year? Top Cow is there every year and I thought they might be
&gt; working on you to go again to promote the current issue of Rising
&gt; Stars which should be what 5 by April?

      Nothing's really been set yet as far as I know....

                                                                  jms
