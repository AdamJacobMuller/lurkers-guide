      Actually, I've finally figured out TNT's marketing strategy for
Crusade, and I've come to realize that I'm wrong, it's an utterly
innovative and unprecedented campaign.

      See, the more PR you put out there about a show, the more you
are going to prejudice a potential audience for or -- possibly --
against the program. So the best way to combat this is to put out
little or no PR so that the audience can come to the show without *any*
prior preconceptions whatsoever.

      It's breathtaking, I tell you...breathtaking.

                                                                  jms

(PS, there's a very good Crusade article in the current issue of
Dreamwatch Magazine, from the UK but available out here, that really
gets into the nuts and bolts of what happened.)
