<pre> Gar Harris &lt;76657.3333@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; But you are saying that dispite the numerical sequence being
&gt; disordered, Crusade remains a contining story rather than
&gt; standalone episodes? Also would you answer the question I asked
&gt; about storyboards not being used in episodic TV?

"But you are saying that dispite the numerical sequence being

episodes?"

      They're somewhat stand alone that was introducing characters and
setting up the details that would kick the arc into gear with #14.

"Also would you answer the question I asked about storyboards not
being used in episodic TV?"

      We used them all the time.

                                                                  jms
