<pre> Richard M Perry &lt;76461.2737@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; And what was it, a year after the announced release that Wing
&gt; Commander III finally hit the shelves? Did you get Batman War on
&gt; Crime?

      Yeah, got War on Crime...I mean, c'mon, it's Alex Ross, to NOT
get it would be sacrilege.  As always, he does a great job, though I
thought the script was not quite on the same level as the art.

                                                                  jms
