<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; My question is this: Did the Carey show producers have to get
&gt; your (or somebody's) permission to use the B5 stuff in this ep? 
&gt; Did you know about it?

      Actually, those WERE our costumes and prosthetics, loaned to
them.

                                                                  jms
