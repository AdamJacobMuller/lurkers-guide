<pre> JudyL &lt;72520.216@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Actually, I meant why is he the wrong person for the job and why
&gt; did Sheridan specifically pick him for the job, but I imagine
&gt; (hope) we'll be filled in on that little story along the way?

      Sheridan picked him for the qualities that made him exactly the
*wrong* person from their point of view...obstinate, difficult,
independent, not prone to following orders from home, not politically
astute...but he'll get the job done.

                                                                  jms
