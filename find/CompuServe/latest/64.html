"And yet I don't recall a scene in B5 in which you fragged the head of
ITN or any other network."

      No, but there were occasional little hidden messages in the
episode, as when a character says, "We've had to make some compromises
to get this show on the road."  No one noticed that one, despite being
rather literal.

                                                                  jms
