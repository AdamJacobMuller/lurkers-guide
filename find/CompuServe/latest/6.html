<pre> Darran Williams &lt;101656.2143@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; As this has only appeared on the Ch4 website and noone else seems
&gt; to know anything about it, I suspect its just someone joking
&gt; about but has anyone here heard anything ? Joe ?

      This is the first I've heard of it, so the likelihood of this
having any basis in fact is about zip.

                                                                  jms
