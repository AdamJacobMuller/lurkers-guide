      In the opening of act one, the camera pans around Ivanova's desk
to reveal her.  In foreground in that shot is a small area with several
of what look like medals or frame.  In the midst of that is a long
rocket pointing upward, on a round bronze disk.  That's the Hugo.  The
camera continues on past it to reveal her, so it's in the first few
moments of the act.

                                                                  jms
