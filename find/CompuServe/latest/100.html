      Thanks, this one is a favorite of mine as well.  It was one of
the scripts written while we were still shooting the first 5, before
TNT got into the process.  When that happened, they made it clear that
they *hated* this story, felt that nobody would be interested in all
this backstory...and asked for it all to be taken out, let them run
into this alien and make him an evil character, an emotional vampire
who drives them insane.

      This was one of the first scripts where I dug in my heels
bigtime and refused to do what they asked.  I knew it would be
powerful; they thought it would be utterly uninteresting.  They were
wrong.

                                                                  jms
