<pre> Seanchai &lt;75754.3567@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Are you legally able to tell us how Crusade would have ended and
&gt; share some of its secrets? Would you be able to outline a set of
&gt; books similar to what you did with PsiCorp and the Technomages? In
&gt; other words, do you own the unwritten parts of Crusade or does
&gt; TNT?

      Not knowing the final word, I really can't get into this...but
if there were to be no more eps, I'm not sure that I would want to get
into a long dissertation of what would've been...because what would be
the point?  It was made to be *done*, not talked about.  In addition,
for myself, it would be better to move on to other projects at that
point rather than stay immersed in that one universe.

                                                                  jms
