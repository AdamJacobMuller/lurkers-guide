<H2>Episode order?</H2>

<pre> Neil S. Turkenkopf &lt;102664.3532@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Was this your decision,like the eps were shot out of sequence for
&gt; some reason? Or if not,then what does it mean?

      The numerical sequence was massively juggled due to changes and
stuff...so ignore the production numbers *entirely*.  We start at 108,
then go all over the place, with the final 5 being 103, 101, 102, 104
and ending on 105.  Just go by the titles.

                                                                  jms
