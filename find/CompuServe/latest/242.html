<pre> Rebecca Eschliman &lt;76072.2345@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Does it seem like a whole new crateful of chainsaws to juggle?

Message text written by Rebecca Eschliman: "I'd be interested in your
reaction as either (or both) a writer or producer to the AOL/T-W
merger, not as it applies to B5 specifically, but what it bodes for the
future in getting new shows launched and supported.  Does it seem like
a whole new crateful of chainsaws to juggle? "

Unfortunately, I really don't know/understand enough about the
situation to have an informed opinion.
