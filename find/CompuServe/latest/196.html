<H2>RISING STARS #2 OUT</H2>
<h3>Date: 29 Sep 1999 15:48:14 -0700</h3>
<pre>      As an FYI to those who've been waiting, RISING STARS #2 makes
its appearance this week at a comics store near you.  It's a good one,
concerning invulnerability, what it *really* would mean, what good or
bad results would come of living with it...and the mystery of how you
kill someone who can't be killed.

                                                                  jms
