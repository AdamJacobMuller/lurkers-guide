"I seem to recall reading in one of the B5 magazines that when JMS was
first trying to sell the idea of B5, he was aware that DS9 was also in
the pipeline, so to say that DS9 is a knock-off is not strictly true
although some of the later story lines are similar."

      Negative.  We began trying to sell the B5 series to everyone in
town, including Paramount, 5 years prior to getting a Go order.  The B5
series was announced in early November of that year.  There was NO set
ST series by that point.  Over the following Christmas weekend, I got a
phone call from someone very closely involved with Trek, who said,
"They just decided what the new Trek show is going to be.  It's about a
space station that's a center of commerce, with a travel gate nearby."

      So your information is quite incorrect.  Nor did it come from
the B5 magazine (there's only one).

"Still JMS must be quite pleased if it is a knock-off, as to copy ones
ideas is the greatest form of praise."

      Let me steal your car and see if you feel the same way
afterward.
