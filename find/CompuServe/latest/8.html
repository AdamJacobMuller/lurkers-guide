<H2>Writing "Crusade"</H2>
<h3>Date: 12 Mar 1999 13:38:01 -0700</h3>
<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; "If they make a season 2 of 'Crusade', will you come back and
&gt; write it, or will someone else write it? And, if I can sneak in a
&gt; question of my own, anything new on a possible "B5" DVD release? 
&gt; Widescreen? Supplements?

      One thing at a time; as Ted Kennedy (might've) said, I'll drive
off that bridge when I come to it....
