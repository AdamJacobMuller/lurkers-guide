<H2>Fan Mail Reroute</H2>
<h3>Date: 24 May 1999 21:19:13 -0700</h3>
<pre>      Just a quick note: the mail drop for all B5 cast and crew is
being shifted from the Ventura Blvd. mail drop to the official Fan Club
address, which is PO Box 856, North Hollywood, CA 91603.  All mail for
those folks should go to that address henceforth.

                                                                  jms
