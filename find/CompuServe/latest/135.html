<pre> SysOp Dupa T. Parrot &lt;70040.104@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; What did you show there?

      Not much, just a music video and took questions; they only had
me in there for 45 minutes so there wasn't much time.  Mainly there to
promote Rising Stars.

                                                                  jms
