"The only thing I can think of is that they hope to catch the eye of
existing B5 fans by showing the footage."

      Given that the footage used was absolutely unremarkable --
guards standing outside the B5 council chambers, a woman in a starfury
cockpit from ItB, Keffer getting burned, a few others -- that prospect
seems thin at best.

                                                                  jms
