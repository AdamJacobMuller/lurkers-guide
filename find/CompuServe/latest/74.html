<pre> JudyL &lt;72520.216@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Ummm, ok....why?

      Also...they said the senator scene was too long (which it
*wasn't* before the big montage/video/the senator explains it all for
you sequence was added in), and to cut stuff out of that scene and add
it to the fight in the beginning.

                                                                  jms
