"Normally I would say this is good, but if the parent company is
loosing money through this, you would imagine that the parten company
steps in.... Well, maybe I am too positive about this"

      Part of the WB/B5/TNT hassle has always been getting caught in
the switches on who IS the parent.  Time/Warner says we own TNT (which
they do), but then TNT says the biggest shareholder in TW is...Ted
Turner (which is also true).  Part of this massively ugly struggle has
been that fight for power, and we've been kind of the football on many
occasions.

                                                                  jms
