      What's interesting is that there was an apparent incident
reported in the news lately where some Star Trek fans showed up en
masse to picket and pick a fight with a line of Star Wars fans waiting
to get into a screening of TPW because they didn't like the publicity
SW was getting.

                                                                  jms
