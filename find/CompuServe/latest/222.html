"Probably wishful thinking on the part of the originators."

      Except, of course, that the *originators* KNOW that it's not
true.  It may be wishful thinking on the part of those who *hear it*,
but the person who tells a fib knows that he is telling a fib.

      On the internet, inside information is currency, and there will
always be counterfeiters among us.

                                                                  jms
