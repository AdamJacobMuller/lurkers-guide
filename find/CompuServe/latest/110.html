<pre> Brad Walrod &lt;76702.1043@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Since you've got so many pre-orders, do you think Image might
&gt; consider offering a subscription (don't know if they do that with
&gt; their other stuff)?

      I actually don't know if they do subscription or not...I think
you can also order it from www.anotheruniverse.com.

                                                                  jms
