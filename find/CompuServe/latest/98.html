"I'm very curious where Joe's going with Galen's character."

      Actually, Galen has quite a secret he's carrying around with
him.  It formed the basis of scripts 114 ("To the Ends of the Earth")
and 116 ("End of the Line," which would've been the cliffhanger).  It's
also a major element of the coming technomage novels.  There's a very
small reference to it in the episode airing this week, when Galen
mentions that he and someone else have been "betrayed by our own kind."

      It also ties into why they were in such a rush to get the hell
out of known space during the shadow war.

                                                                  jms
