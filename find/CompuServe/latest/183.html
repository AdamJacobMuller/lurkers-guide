<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Were you qouted accurately?
&gt; If so, can you add anything to the initial report?
&gt; (Aspect ratio, number of eps per disc, supplementary material?)
&gt; Any idea when we can expect an official announcement from Warner
&gt; Home Video? Will you be invited to participate in preparing the
&gt; DVD release (unlike the LDs?) If so, will you have the time?

      All I know is what I've been told...that the DVDs will be out
sometime next year; I don't know in what format; I do know they're
going to be releasing "River of Souls" in full widescreen in the UK
(don't know if that's DVD or tape) and if it does well they'll do
widescreen elsewhere (same disclaimer); and no, haven't been asked to
participate in the thing.

                                                                  jms
