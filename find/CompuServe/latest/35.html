"I swear, the folks at TNT are being shown different versions of this
stuff than the rest of us.  It's the only way to explain some of this."

      We've gotten used to it.  Their promotions department is one of
the most inept I've ever seen.  I finally snagged the Crusade promo,
and not only did they make terrible selections of footage, a) about
half the footage isn't even FROM Crusade, it's from B5 and A Call to
Arms (inclusive of Keffer getting gakked in season 2), and b) the
little Crusade footage they DO use is repeated several times (first one-
frame each, then again, mostly people just standing around).

      We've delivered virtually all of the episodes, there's plenty of
stuff to draw on...why on *earth* would they go to B5 for footage?  And
why on earth would they use the same uninteresting Crusade footage
repeatedly, all this in a 20 second promo, where every second counts?

      The only possible answer I can come up with is that these
promotions people are totally and completely inept...which would
explain why the majority of their shows are doing terribly right now.

                                                                  jms
