<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; I do have one question; how much of the riot scenes were real new
&gt; footage?

      It was all real footage.

      As for the exposition...one reason they asked for so much was
because they said it was going to air months after ACTA, and nobody'd
remember, and it wouldn't get rerun...then after we shot WZ they
decided they *would* rerun ACTA before WZ...then a few weeks ago they
decided to run ACTA -- which has all the info needed for WZ -- AFTER
WZ.

      Now perhaps you get a small sense of what we've been up against.

                                                                  jms
