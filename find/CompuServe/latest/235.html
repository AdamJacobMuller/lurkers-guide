"But, like you, I was rather taken aback by the attitude of the author
in the second book.  He was clearly miffed and allowed that to color
what could otherwise have been a well done second book.  Clearly, the
objectivity was gone."

      Yup.

"Still, he did manage to put in a couple of things worth seeing.  In
particular, he quoted the entire 'Declaration of Principles' from
'Paragon of Animals'."

      Which a) he didn't write, b) I did, and get nothing for the
reuse of my material, c) is widely available online, and d) can be
transcribed by anyone from the episode, so you don't need the book to
do that.

                                                                  jms
