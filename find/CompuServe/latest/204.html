<H2>Is there a Best Episode?</H2>
<h3>Date: 18 Oct 1999 18:36:03 -0700</h3>
<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; What episode(s) of Crusade deserve consideration for this?

"As you know, the SFWA reinstated the Dramatic Nebula.  What
episode(s) of Crusade deserve consideration for this?"

      I dunno...maybe THE MEMORY OF WAR, though if anything deserves
it, it's THE MATRIX.

                                                                  jms
