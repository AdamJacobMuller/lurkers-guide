<pre> Graham Smith &lt;74010.764@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Who edits this thing anyway?

"However, the real hoot for me is that Joe is dressed in a sport coat,
turtle neck, and *blue jeans*.  Just my kind of outfit.  A snappy
dresser to the end :)"

      It was either that or wear proper slacks with a Superman tie.  I
just can't take anything seriously....

                                                                  jms
