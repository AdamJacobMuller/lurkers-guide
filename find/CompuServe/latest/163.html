&gt; And in a way, the darkest part is Gideon's flashback, when the
&gt; ambassadors, looking after their own interests as usual, force
&gt; him into this devil's bargain of abandoning his search in 4 years
&gt; if he's unsuccessful (Too bad, I used to like the Brakiri
&gt; ambassador!) It makes me wonder whether, if push came to shove
&gt; and the cure hadn't been found at the end of 4 years, Gideon
&gt; would actually keep his word?

"JMS has hinted elsewhere that the cure might be found before the end
of the series. He's also said the show we think we're watching will
turn out not to be the show we're actually watching.  Put these two
together, and I wonder greatly if, had the next few years played out,
he might have gradually uncovered some other, greater theme or conflict
that would overshadow the plague, and take over the plot for the last
year or so."

      If not sooner....
