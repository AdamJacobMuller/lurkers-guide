<pre> John Bendel &lt;73447.741@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; So, who's right?
&gt; More importantly, if they are out where can I get them?

1. Rising Star #0 and #1 were out but are no longer available.

      The 0 issue was published in the Wizard Magazine FATHOM special
a couple months ago and can still be found; the Preview issue was
published in a special limited edition around the same time and is
harder to find.

2. They are very late and there is no release date.

      Issue 1 was put back one month so it could debut at the Chicago
comic con next weekend (where I'll be attending).  It will hit comic
stores July 28th.

3. They aren't being published.

      Bull ka-ka.

                                                                  jms
