<pre> Roberto Micheri &lt;102701.435@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is it true?
&gt; What happened to the Role-Playing game?
&gt; Have you considered another comapny?
&gt; Perhaps generic role-playing games supplements, where some
&gt; guidelines are given to adapt the material to other systems? Are
&gt; you into Role-Playing at all? Have you ever considered a visual
&gt; dictionary for Babylon 5, like the ones done by DK for Star Wars?

      Peter David is doing the Centauri trilogy, Jeanne Cavelos the
Technomage trilogy, and I believe the RPG company went out of business.

                                                                  jms
