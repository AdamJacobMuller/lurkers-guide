<pre> Vadim Naroditsky &lt;72133.1175@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; What can one do with enemies if they won't stop fighting except
&gt; destroy them? Would Corps kill them if they voluntarily gave up
&gt; fighting and came back to Corps? How can a person advance from a
&gt; civilian to a first officer so fast? If it is not a secret, will
&gt; we see Bester in Crusade?

"If it is not a secret, will we see Bester in Crusade?"

      You would have, in episode 15, "Value Judgments," by Avery. 
Walter considered it one of the best Bester scripts to date.

                                                                  jms
