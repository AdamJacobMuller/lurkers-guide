<pre> Carl Cantarella &lt;105030.3700@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; And if you don't mind my asking, have there been any promising or
&gt; potentially promising developments regarding getting "Crusade"
&gt; back into production again for another network?

      The word "limited" was their choice to try and put a positive
spin on things from their side, "Oh, we meant to do it this way."

      And we probably won't have any clearer ideas on the future of
the show until the very last minute, around the second week of July. 
That's typical TV business stuff these days.

                                                                  jms
