<pre> T.P.Chai &lt;104674.3064@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; But what about the 4 scripts that are already written?
&gt; will you be able to sell the scripts, publish them somehow?
&gt; If the series does get a new home, will the finished scripts be
&gt; the start of a new season?

"JMS, you have indicated that you have no interest in continue to work
with the Crusade storyline if it doesn't get picked up. But what about
the 4 scripts that are already written? will you be able to sell the
scripts, publish them somehow? I think I can speak for all the fans
that WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS NEXT!"

      The only one that I know will be available: this Friday at
NASFIC (at a table set aside for SFFNET folks) Fiona Avery will be
selling a limited number of copies of her script for "Value Judgments,"
the unproduced CRUSADE script featuring Bester (which Walter considered
had some of the best Bester stuff to date).  I believe it's in the
afternoon at some point.

                                                                  jms
