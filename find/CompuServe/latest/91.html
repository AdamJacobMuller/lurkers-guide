<H2>CRUSADE Bible Available</H2>
<h3>Date: 25 Jun 1999 18:25:12 -0700</h3>
<pre>      To all interested:

      For the many who have asked over the years for such material,
copies of the Writers Bible for CRUSADE are now available at
www.thestation.com.  This is the actual series bible (with some digital
photos inserted) used in Crusade, and contains a fair amount of
information that will be revealed in the later episodes.  This is the
first time we've made a writer's bible available from the B5 universe.

                                                                  jms
