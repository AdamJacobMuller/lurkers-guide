<H2>Path Ratings?</H2>
<h3>Date: 06 Jul 1999 00:02:11 -0700</h3>
<pre> Peter Kazmir &lt;112055.402@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; So, can you tell us what the ratings were for Path of Sorrows?

      I haven't heard on the ratings yet, because everybody kinda
split early for the 4th holiday, but I wouldn't be surprised at all if
it came in well under a 1 rating, since it didn't air until midnight on
the East Coast, a number of folks didn't know it had been moved and
tuned in at the usual time, and many of those who did know about the
change gave up on waiting on the draft's conclusion.  GIven all that, I
would be *vastly* surprised if it did even a .7 or so.

                                                                  jms
