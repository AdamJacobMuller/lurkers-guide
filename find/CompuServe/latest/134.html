<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; "Several others"???
&gt; will presumably want to remaster the episodes for HDTV broadcast
&gt; anyway (wasn't this one of the reasons you shot the show the way
&gt; you did?) why should the time and expense be an issue? While I
&gt; would very much like to see "Crusade" return, I'm just as excited
&gt; at the prospect of something totally new from your pen (word
&gt; processor, whatever.) Any chance you could do *both*? Or shouldn't
&gt; I wish that much work on anybody &lt;g&gt;?

      Interesting...all I can say is that I gave up trying to
understand the ways of Warner Bros. years ago.  None of it makes much
sense.

                                                                  jms
