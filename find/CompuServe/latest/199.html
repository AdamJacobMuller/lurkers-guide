<H2>B5 Crew Jackets Here</H2>
<h3>Date: 05 Oct 1999 17:55:02 -0700</h3>
<pre>      Pitchman mode on:

      One of the main questions I get at conventions, when I show up
flying the colors, is "Where can I get that jacket?"  As those've
who've been there will attest, my answer has always been, "You can't. 
They're only for cast and crew."

      So there've been a lot of requests for this particular item over
the years...so for this month only, www.thestation.com will be offering
a limited number (about 200) of B5 jackets.  These are essentially
identical to the other crew jackets, same material, same manufacturer,
same detailed logo embroidered on the back.  It's a *nice* jacket (and
available for a hell of a lot less than the $500-1000 some of them have
been sold for in the past on ebay and convention auctions).

      But they're going to go fast.  Same as with the Gathering
script, which was only available in September, and is now off market. 
(The next one for sale, this month only, is the script for Midnight on
the Firing Line.)

      Pitchman mode off.
