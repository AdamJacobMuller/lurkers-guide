<pre> Dan T. Davis &lt;71121.1254@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Now that I know how you held out, let me also praise the
&gt; inclusion of the non-sequiter Apocalypse Box - why should every
&gt; "emotion revealed" by the forgiveness being "only" emphasize and
&gt; reflect on plot points we are aware of?

      Re: the Matheson scene...that one was cut back by about 40%
because the episode ran long.  (That sometimes happens on dialogue-
intensive episodes.) The original version had it go over a longer
period of time, and showed him coming over gradually.  It is a bit
abrupt as it is now, though I still think it plays.

                                                                  jms
