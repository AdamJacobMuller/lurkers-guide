<pre> Shawn D. Ratner &lt;73753.175@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Are there plans for a Babylon 5 2000 Calendar?
&gt; Have you had the opportunity to watch the progress of the Babylon
&gt; 5 Space Combat Simulator? Are there any plans for new merchandise?

      Yes, there's going to continue to be new merchandise coming
out... there's a new set from Fleer, another company just acquired the
license to do limited edition pewter and gold figurines (good sixed
ones) of the varius B5 ships (and the Excalibur), more novels, special
collector's cards with a sound chip imbedded that play 30 seconds of
stuff...and so on.  I don't know about a calendar yet, we usually don't
get those things in until around September.

                                                                  jms
