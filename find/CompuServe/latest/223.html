      It's nothing to do with Crusade as a *product*.  It's Crusade
and the writing thereof as an *art form* that is at issue here.  If a
composer was stopped from finishing a symphony, and someone said,
"Well, can you talk about what you *would* have done?" it's an
impossible question...a symphony is meant to be *heard* not talked
about.

      Further, it would mean my spending a great deal of time dwelling
on something that I won't be able to *do*.  For me, it's not an
academic exercise, it's a point of great personal frustration...why in
heaven's name should I choose to enhance that any further by dwelling
on all the cool things I could've/would've done had TNT not pulled the
plug?

                                                                  jms
