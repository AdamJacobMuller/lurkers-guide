<pre> Richard M Perry &lt;76461.2737@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; (this week's episode changed their opinion though) A question
&gt; from class, in the scene where we see Gideon and Lochley heading
&gt; toward the shower together, did you intentionally pick that
&gt; specific ship to dock with the station? The ship docking was
&gt; obviously placed for its subliminal value, but did you
&gt; intentionally use that ship design? Who was Mr. Kitty?
&gt; Was he your cat?
&gt; How are things going with you?
&gt; Have you played the South Park or Star Wars Racer games yet?
&gt; When you play as Jesus and he gets hit, his comment is "You don't
&gt; want to go to hell, do you?" What else can you say about racing
&gt; your friends at 600 MPH? So, when is the next time you'll be in
&gt; Florida? Is Top Cow bringing you back to Megacon next March?
&gt; (Maybe next year though) Speaking of which, have you gotten back
&gt; into your comic book habit yet? What books are you reading lately?

      Don't know about Marcon yet; nothing's set.  As for the image of
the ship docking at that particular moment...yeah, that was most
definitely deliberate.  When I, er, inserted it during editing, the
editor just *looked* at me and said "you are just sick and wrong."

                                                                  jms
