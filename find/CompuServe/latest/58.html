"Somehow I get the feeling that the reason the Detroit Free Press
reviewer said that Crusade looked "like it came from the planet Cheez-
Whiz" can be summed up in 3 letters.... TNT.  Unfortunately, if the
first episode were all I had to go by I'd have to agree with him."

      And I would as well.

      That's the thing about all this...in the negative comments about
War Zone -- and actually there have been far fewer than I'd anticipated
 -- there ain't much that I'd disagree with.  If anything, they've
tickled me because they reflect EXACTLY what I'd said when these things
were asked for.  It's been a massive validation.

                                                                  jms
