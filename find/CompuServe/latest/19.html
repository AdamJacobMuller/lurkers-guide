<pre> T.P.Chai &lt;104674.3064@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; JMS, are your 3 stories going to be in consecutive issues of
&gt; Amazing Stories?

      I don't know; I think so but don't know for sure.  There's an
amazing stories website that may have the info.

                                                                  jms
