<pre>I posted this elswhere, and figured I'd put it here as well, even
though it's not technically B5 per se.

A quick update on the latest RISING STARS news:

I've now seen the inked and colored final pages on issue 1, and I have
to say that I'm very, very pleased by the final result.  It took a bit
of doing to get there, but the result is quite nice.  It has the *feel*
of a very different sort of book than everything else out there,
something a bit special.

That first issue of RISING STARS, "Nova Placenta," will debut at the
Chicago Comic Con in two weeks, where I'll be attending and signing
stuff and talking and the like.  (My main presentation has been moved
from Sunday to Saturday at around 5ish, I think.)

It will hit comic stores/newsstands around the 28th of this month.

Advance orders have already topped 100,000 (before re-orders) and it
looks like that may not be enough.

This is a comic that I feel very strongly about, it's something I've
wanted to do for a long, long time.  I think it's something that will
appeal to most B5 folks, because it has many of the same elements in
the sense that it treats the genre seriously, tries new and different
approaches to characterization, has an overall story arc with a
beginning, middle and end (24 issues from now), and so on.  I think
it'll appeal equally to non-comics fans and those familiar with the
form.  It's also something that I think can be read by a variety of age
ranges, all of whom will get something different out of it.

In any event...I'm very happy with the thing, and wanted to put the
word out there about it.

I'm especially pleased that the first issue will have a forward by
Neil Gaiman, a name that should be familiar to both B5 folks ("Day of
the Dead") and comics readers around the planet.

The book is being published by TOP COW (a division of Image Comics,
publisher of SPAWN), also the publishers of FATHOM and DARKNESS.  It
should be available at any goodly-sized comics store, and there are
several places on-line where one can find comics.

It's gonna be a fun book.
