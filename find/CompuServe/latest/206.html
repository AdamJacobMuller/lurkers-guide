"The only nomination so far is a Swedish porn flick that is only
incidentally SF.  The group that nominated that one want to embarrass
the organization into re-abolishing the award.  It's a very sorry
mess."

      Of course.  It's SFWA.

      Never have I seen a group that writes about technology so
frightened of a form of technological storytelling.  They're the writer-
equivilents of Luddites.  (Meaning the ones pulling this crap.)
