<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Does anyone at WB know what they're doing?
&gt; Who is in charge over there?

      I'm astouned that they would do that to the two movies...there
was no reason to do so unless they just didn't want to spend the
additonal money on two more transfers.  I'm afraid the ways of WB
utterly defy explanation....

                                                                  jms
