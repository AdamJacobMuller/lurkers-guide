<pre> Neil S. Turkenkopf &lt;102664.3532@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Was this a reference to the Plague/Cure?

"As Gideon was preparing Greenberg's body for Airlock'nLoad,the
alienwithin was pleading:"Don't do this! Iknow what you're looking
for!" Was this a reference to the Plague/Cure?"

      Yep.  But since the body couldn't talk aloud, it couldn't
communicate this effectively.

                                                                  jms
