"I have seen that concept before, but with the last five supposedly
being the first five intending to be shown, how do they rationalize the
uniform change? The order shown has them going from the nice looking
dark uniforms to the ugly things of late.  Were they going to change
back or were they really shown in order, just not the production order
(or the 'preferred' order)?"

      It's not a "concept," it's what happened.  "Appearances" was
written to set up the change to the grey original uniforms, and we
would've gone to black again in "To the Ends of the Earth."

                                                                  jms
