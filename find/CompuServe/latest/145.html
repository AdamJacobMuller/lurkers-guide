<pre> Randy Pastrone &lt;76436.2204@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; In the last episode were all the references to color schemes and
&gt; the new uniforms a deliberate poke at Star Trek? Excalibur?

"In the last episode were all the references to color schemes and the
new uniforms a deliberate poke at Star Trek?  The colors of the new
uniform are a cross between the jackets that Captain Picard wore and
the colors of the cadet's uniforms.  And the reference to being able to
breath in the high collars which were part of the NG uniform from about
season 2 on.  I don't know if it was intentional but you got a snicker
out of me."

      No, it had nothing to do with ST, it was a shot at TNT.

"Also more out of curiosity were you aware that the new ship in the
Star Trek New Frontier book series which started in 1997 is call the
U.S.S. Excalibur?"

      I didn't know this until well into the process, and basically,
screw 'em, they don't own Camelot.

      This is not a Trek-centric solar system.

                                                                  jms
