<pre> SysOp Deonaha M. Conlin &lt;102531.2627@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; And the passing reference to SOMETHING happening with the teeps -
&gt; Will we ever find out what that something was? That Drakh - Wayne
&gt; Alexander? That new twist - "Who do you trust?"

      All that exposition is what TNT wanted...and one of the reasons
was that they weren't going to rerun ACtA before it...then they were,
which made it all unnecessary...then they ran ACtA AFTER the ep...which
makes NO kind of sense.

                                                                  jms
