<H2>New 2 HR B5 Movie?</H2>
<h3>Date: 16 Feb 2000 23:46:05 -0700</h3>
<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Is this true &amp; what is the general plot?
&gt; and then produce something lame withOUT you at the helm?
&gt; Do you have any form of insurance against "creative pollution"?

Message text written by Rick Corey: "Is there even a remote, horrid
possibility that WB could say "Since we own all rights to B5, we're
going to put out a B5 movie" ... and then produce something lame
withOUT you at the helm? "

Odds are slim and none.
