<pre> Karen S. Hayes &lt;112230.2454@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; (in a good way!) BTW, will he ever realize what was meant by
&gt; "saving the eye that does not see?" Am I correct in guessing that
&gt; you learned it mainly from writing screenplays?

"I paid a price for my eagerness in reading this story before any of
the others in this issue. You can say so much in so few words, that
afterwards I found myself a bit impatient with the wordiness of a
couple of the other stories, which lessened my enjoyment of them. I've
learned to make every word count from the rigorous demands of article
word limits.  Am I correct in guessing that you learned it mainly from
writing screenplays?"

      That's about half it, the other half being a background in
journalism, where you learn to get to the point quickly and
efficiently.  I'm actually quite pleased with the story.

"I've also just read the page proofs of Final Reckoning to review it
for B5 magazine. I would have read it  in one sitting, except that
around page 175 I had to take a break. I was afraid I would start
hyperventilating. 'Nuff said, until we can all talk about it here."

      It really is a kick in the gut, isn't it?  When I was outlining
it for Greg, I remember thinking a) I don't envy him the job of making
this happen, and b) feeling really excited about what was going to
happen.  It's about the closest I've come to Greek tragedy outside the
Londo arc.

                                                                  jms
