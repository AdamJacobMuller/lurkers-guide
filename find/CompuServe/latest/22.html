<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Can they DO this?
&gt; Speaking of DVD rentals &lt;g&gt; - any news?

      I can't see any reason why they couldn't, since it was a
promotional thing, as opposed to a piece of mass-marketed merchandise
for sale.

                                                                  jms
