<pre> Karen S. Hayes &lt;112230.2454@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; How did they hook up with you for this segment?

Message text written by Karen S. Hayes: "How did they hook up with you
for this segment? I ask out of professional curiosity, because I know
that often--not always, but often-- finding the right interview subject
for a piece is pure luck and serendipity on the part of the
interviewer. "

Apparently the segment producer was a big B5 fan, so she called one
day.
