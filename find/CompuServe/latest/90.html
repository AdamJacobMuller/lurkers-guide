<pre> Pam Jernigan &lt;75540.2554@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; What I wanna know is, how did Matheson get to such a (relatively)
&gt; high rank so quickly? Just a few short years ago, teeps weren't
&gt; allowed to join EarthForce, so where did he get his experience?

      The original air order would have spread out the Galen episodes,
so that he would appear every second or third episode...that changed
with the short order, and they all got bunched together.

                                                                  jms
