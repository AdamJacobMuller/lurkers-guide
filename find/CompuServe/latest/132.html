<H2>Any official word?</H2>
<h3>Date: 19 Jul 1999 00:50:09 -0700</h3>
<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Has there been any official decision?
&gt; Is another season still possible?
&gt; Is it desirable?
&gt; Is there any balance possible that gives you a life, and us
&gt; Crusade?

      Have the actor's options expired?  Yes.  Does this close the
door?  No, another channel could say yes even after #13, it would just
mean negotiating new contracts, which is quite do-able.  If it happens
I can deal with it; if not, I have plenty of other options.  I've never
been a one-trick pony.

                                                                  jms
