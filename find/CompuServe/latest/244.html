<pre> Graham Smith &lt;74010.764@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is this legit, or has someone ripped off something?

Message text written by Graham Smith: "There is a Crusade "Workprint"
copy of "Racing the Night" for sale on eBay, Item# 244480063.

Is this legit, or has someone ripped off something? "

It's definitely not legal for people to be selling that stuff.
