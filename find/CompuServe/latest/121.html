"This is the Gideon that I think that you've created for us.  He's a
lot like Sheridan, making his own decisions based on his own real-time
understanding of the situation at hand.  He's also a lot unlike
Sheridan, playing his cards close to the chest and willing to "cheat"
as a first solution rather than as a fallback position.  Sheridan was
Ben Cartwright. Gideon is Brett Maverick. &lt;g&gt; Am I close? :-)"
