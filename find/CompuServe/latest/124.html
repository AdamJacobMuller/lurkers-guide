<pre> T.P.Chai &lt;104674.3064@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Were you present?
&gt; Peter Jurasic was there too (as well as Wortham Krimmer - the 3
&gt; Centauri emperors!), he's never heard of the story and blurted
&gt; out something very much like the punch line, "Is there any doubt
&gt; who Vir is?"

      That was probably the pre-casting session, which is held before
the final auditions for the producers (me et al).

                                                                  jms
