<pre> Rebecca Eschliman &lt;76072.2345@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Have your heard of any more new series (or old) that have adopted
&gt; the Babylonian method of organized production?

      Not that I've heard, in terms of production, though in terms of
story arc, the guys who do E:FC have said in print that they want to do
a B5 style arc, and a few others are doing the same.

                                                                  jms
