<pre> Arthur Stoppe &lt;73710.2014@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; "In the last episode were all the references to color schemes and
&gt; the new uniforms a deliberate poke at Star Trek? Was this the
&gt; intent?

"I thought the designer character  was played a lot like the Victor
Spinetti TV director character from "A Hard Days Night", -you know, the
same kind of fidgety nervous quirkiness, which I thought was really
cool.  I thought its was too similar to be anything other than a
tribute of sorts and not merely a coincidence.  Was this the intent?"

      No.  Never even occured to me.

      I *am* capable of making up my own characters, you know....

                                                                  jms
