<pre> Michael Kalus &lt;100265.3065@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Turner is a Time Warner company, so WHY is it up to TNT to decide
&gt; if they prolong the series??? Couldn't Warner (IF they believe in
&gt; the series) not simply push it through?

      Because they're totally independent organizations (that's how
Time/Warner is structured), and one division cannot force another to
do anything.  It is, in my view, just a tad dysfunctional.

                                                                  jms
