      Not really, no...I always imagined that Z'ha'dum was originally
the Minbari word for the place, and the Z'ha has echoes in Entil-zha
and Isil-zha. The dum (doom) part is obvious.  Not to say I wasn't
aware of Khazad-dum, but it wasn't on my mind at the time.

                                                                  jms
