<pre> T.P.Chai &lt;104674.3064@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; JMS, since Dr. Chambers is visable on the ship before it's seen
&gt; to be destroyed, is she also officially dead? or perhaps that
&gt; footage would not be seen by anyone else so it doesn't matter?

      It's only ever going to be seen by the general, and bear in mind
that in that shot Chambers was WAY in the background, it was only seen
for a moment on the monitor, with the General more concerned about
what's happening in FG, and in any event he would have to instantly
recognize her by sight, and he didn't know her.

                                                                  jms
