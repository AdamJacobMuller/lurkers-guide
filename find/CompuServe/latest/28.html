<pre> David L Trahan &lt;110714.3375@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; No offense, sir, but could you please put a spoiler warning next
&gt; time you give spoilers for non-B5 shows like that?

"No offense, sir, but could you please put a spoiler warning next time
you give spoilers for non-B5 shows like that?  I mean, I know this is a
B5 forum, but some people here, such as me, watch shows like DS9, and
do not want to know stuff like that about episodes yet to air."

      Sorry, figured it couldn't be much of a spoiler since we'd
already done it on our show....
