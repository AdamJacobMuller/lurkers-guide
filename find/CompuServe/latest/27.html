      I haven't seen 'em...only have heard that the last DS9 ep is
pretty much the same as what we did in SiL.  Don't know that for a
fact, but the word on the street is that Sisko goes off with the
ancient ones, never to return, and the station gets blowed up.

                                                                  jms
