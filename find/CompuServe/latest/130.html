<pre> SysOp Dupa T. Parrot &lt;70040.104@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; So, was I seeing things or not?

"I noticed the fellow with the "Copeland" sign early in the show. I
saw another sign-holder who was out of focus and that sign looked like
"Straczynski." So, was I seeing things or not?"

      Yes on the first, no on the second.

                                                                  jms
