"SiL was written and filmed before Season 5 and would have been the
final episode of Season 4 had Season 5 not happened.  In that light,
this comment more likely refers to the problems they had in Season 4
than any as-yet-untold problems."

      Except of course that Garibaldi's whole future arc was known to
me; whether or not there was a S5, his future was his future.
