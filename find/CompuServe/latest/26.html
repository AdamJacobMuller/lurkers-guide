      It's really a rather cruel joke.  According to the latest on the
website, they're looking at 7 a.m. or 8 a.m. M-F.  And they want input
on this poll from fans who are given nothing for options on where to
put it.

      If anyone were to ask me, I'd be *happy* to tell TNT where to
put it.

                                                                  jms
