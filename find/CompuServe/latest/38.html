<pre> Tim &lt;106273.3321@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; So whats stopping you from starting litigation now ?
&gt; Personally I would love to see the mountain having its peak
&gt; lopped off &lt;g&gt; At the very least you could use the publicity to
&gt; correct all those misinformed sci-fi fans out there ?

      Because, again, I do not *own* B5, not now, not before, not once
WB bought it.  The copyright belongs to WB, and they don't like to get
into these kinds of tussels.

                                                                  jms
