<pre> Michael R. Marks &lt;104504.455@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Do you watch Crusade when it airs?

      No, if that were to happen, it won't make a major difference,
since at most a few hundred people will ever see the script, and that
ain't hardly a blip on the ratings.  More folks than that see a script
when it's sent out for actors to use for auditions.

                                                                  jms
