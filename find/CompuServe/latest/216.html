<H2>Rising Star 11/22/99</H2>
<h3>Date: 09 Nov 1999 21:18:10 -0700</h3>
<pre>     Just as an FYI, the next issue of RISING STARS will be out at
newsstands around the 22nd.  It's a particularly good one, following
the story of pyrokinetic Lee Jackson after he fled at the beginning. 
We also learn a very possible motive for the series of murders.  It's a
good one.

                                                                  jms
