<pre> JudyL &lt;72520.216@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Ummm, ok....why?

"      There was, for instance, a nice clash with the senator and the
intelligence guy over Gideon's background, why he's the wrong person
for the job, why Sheridan picked him specifically for the job...which
had to go &lt;

Ummm, ok....why?"

      Because something had to go time-wise to make room for other
stuff.  If we'd kept *that*, then something ELSE of similar time would
have to go, such as Dureena's scene in the cell with Gideon, or the
like.  The amount of air time we have per episode does not change.

                                                                  jms
