<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Was this scene editted back together from separate filmings?

"In the scenes with the Senator on Mars I wasn't sure Cole was in the
same room with the other two during the dialogue.  Too many cuts back
and forth and his eyes seemed to move around oddly.  Was this scene
editted back together from separate filmings?"

      At one point in editing we needed some close-ups, and there
weren't any in that part, so we kind of borrowed some from earlier in
the sequence. We do this a lot, when there isn't coverage of some parts
of scenes, rarely does anyone notice the eyeline difference.

                                                                  jms
