<pre> Rebecca Eschliman &lt;76072.2345@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; What do you feel are your strengths in a collaborative effort,
&gt; and what do you look for in a collaborator? What are the pitfalls
&gt; to avoid, and what are the benefits?

      I'm actually the worst person to ask about this, because I
almost never collaborate with another writer.

                                                                  jms
