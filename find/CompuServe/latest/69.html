<pre> Peter Kazmir &lt;112055.402@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is this true?
&gt; Is this good?

      It's a good start...I think they were anticipating less, and so
was I, given the nearly total lack of PR.  It also built every
quarter...it went from 1.8 to 1.8 to 1.9 to 2.0 by the end of the show,
which means we held our audience and built.

      The real test will be next week...from what I understand, a lot
of folks didn't even know it was on until after the fact.

                                                                  jms
