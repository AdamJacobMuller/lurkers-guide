1.  I understand how a blue screen is used for optical effects. Many
    times on Entertainment Tonight (or other shows in this genre) they
will
    do a behind-the-scenes story and I notice that a green screen is
being
    used.  Why use a green screen over a blue screen?

      Green is often used for video, blue for film.  And if you have
blue uniforms, you can't shoot bluescreen behind them.

2.  A strange questions concerning commercials, TV shows, and movies. 
When
    a car is shown driving on a road, the road appears to have been
hosed
    down with water.  On one hand, it may have rained before shooting
began.
    But on the other hand, what are the odds that it always rains
before a
    commercial is filmed!!  Do they water down the road to improve
lighting?

      It looks cooler.

                                                                  jms
