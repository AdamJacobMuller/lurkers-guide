<pre> Shawn D. Ratner &lt;73753.175@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is it possible to have Babylon 5 moved back into syndication?
&gt; Would it be possible to move Crusade into syndication?
&gt; Have your plans for making a Babylon 5 Theatrical Movie been
&gt; moved because of Crusade?

"Is it possible to have Babylon 5 moved back into syndication? I'm
sure many networks would give B5 the respect it deserves. I know the
local station here always supported B5 from the beginning. They also
advertised it on the network many times. The reason I ask this is
because I have seen ER in syndication on a local network while its also
shown on TNT."

      No, I think they bought it exclusively,

"Have your plans for making a Babylon 5 Theatrical Movie been moved
because of Crusade? I've read that you are waiting till all the Star
Wars movies are released before considering a B5 movie."

      I'm in no rush.

                                                                  jms
