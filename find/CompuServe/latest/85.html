<pre> Jeff Peterman &lt;75361.430@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Maybe, but what about their technology?
&gt; By that I mean have the technomages always had abilities just
&gt; slightly ahead of their contemporaries (and used in a way to
&gt; APPEAR miraculous), or have they had the benefit of technology
&gt; from another civilization?

"By that I mean have the technomages always had abilities just
slightly ahead of their contemporaries (and used in a way to APPEAR
miraculous), or have they had the benefit of technology from another
civilization?"

      This is a question that we were going to build, and answer, in
the latter part of the first season...a lot of which will also be in
the 3 technomage novels.

                                                                  jms
