<H2>Crusade in syndication?</H2>
<h3>Date: 16 Aug 1999 21:07:11 -0700</h3>
<pre> Carl Cantarella &lt;105030.3700@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; If the Sci Fi Channel doesn't pick up "Crusade" as some people
&gt; fear won't happen, would you consider trying to prepare the show
&gt; for the syndicated market for next year?

      Unfortunately, the syndicated market has become much more
crowded and much tighter since B5 went on the air, with Tribune and Fox
and UPN and others now claiming vast tracts of exclusive airtime. 
Which is a long way of saying there's no room in syndication.

                                                                  jms
