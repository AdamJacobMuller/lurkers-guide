<H2>Going to Wolf 359 ????</H2>
<h3>Date: 04 Jun 1999 18:06:01 -0700</h3>
<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; I was also wonder of the "mix" of people going, is it mainly B5
&gt; people?

      Since you're (as usual) fronting for Wolf 359 and Brian Cooney,
may I inquire as to whether or not the B5 cast members who got stiffed
the *last* time by Brian's VorCon (a situation verified independently
by Dreamwatch Magazine) -- such as Peter Jurasik, Mira, Bill, Jerry and
others -- ever got paid what they were due for their appearance fees?

                                                                  jms
