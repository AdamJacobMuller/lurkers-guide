      Note to self: you are an idiot.  What you MEANT to say was that
CRUSADE jackets are available, but you WROTE B5 jackets...one might
almost think you had a glitch in your brain in that regard.

      Not only THAT, but it turns out that the Gathering is going to
be available until October 8th because the web site was down for about
a week.

      Can't you get *anything* rite?

                                                                  jms
