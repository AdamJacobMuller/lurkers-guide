<pre> Karen S. Hayes &lt;112230.2454@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Do we find out who this is in the remaining four (*sniff*)
&gt; episodes? And if not, can you give us a little hint?
&gt; On the other hand, that uses up all the "he's" doesn't it?

"Do we find out who this is in the remaining four (*sniff*) episodes?

      Nope.
