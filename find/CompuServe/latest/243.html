&gt; Do you know when your presentations/events are scheduled yet?

Message text written by Martin Roth: "I spotted your name on the guest
list for Gallifrey next month, and by an amazing set of coincidences
I'm actually going to be there part of the time.  Do you know when your
presentations/events are scheduled yet? "

I'm told Sunday at 4.
