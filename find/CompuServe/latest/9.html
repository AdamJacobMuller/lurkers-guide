<H2>jms comic preview out</H2>
<h3>Date: 22 Mar 1999 15:09:12 -0700</h3>
<pre>      So for those who've asked....

      The current issue of WIZARD MAGAZINE, hitting the stands this
week, has a long article about, and a preview issue of, "Rising Stars,"
my new comic from TOP COW, a division of IMAGE comics, publishers of
Spawn and Fathom.

      This is gonna be fun....

                                                                  jms
