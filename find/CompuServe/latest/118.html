<pre> Dan Deckert &lt;74156.1432@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Besides, why go to Sheridan when he's able to work out a solution
&gt; on his own?

      Bear in mind also that Sheridan is totally *outside* Gideon's
chain of command.  His authority goes up to the president of the Earth
Alliance, not the ISA.  It would be like a field commander in NATO
going to Clinton with a problem.  He has to go through the chain of
command first.

                                                                  jms
