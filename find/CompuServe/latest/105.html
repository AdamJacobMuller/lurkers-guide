<pre> Craig M. Bobchin &lt;102354.3246@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Was this that ep?
&gt; If so what happened that prevented using Lyta in this role?
&gt; For the curious of us out here was the new ship we saw a Shadow
&gt; ship?

      Yeah, Lyta would've been in that ep but Pat was on a movie at
the time.

                                                                  jms
