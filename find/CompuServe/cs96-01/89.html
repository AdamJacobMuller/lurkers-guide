<pre> Joel Hilke &lt;102354.1702@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is this more a Warner Brothers thing or a Babylon5 thing?
&gt; How many episodes away is this 2-parter?

     The web as it currently exists is more of a Warners thing.

     The two-parter covers episodes 16 and 17 in the schedule.  So far
we've aired 4.

                                                                  jms
