<pre>      &lt;Quoting William H. DiPaola to JMS&gt;:

      &gt;I seem to recall in the episode from last  season
      &gt;titled, "And Now A Word..." that G'Kar's name was
      &gt;misspelled with in "H"  in place of the "K" when he was
      &gt;being interviewed(G'Har).

     No, I'm pretty sure it was spelled right; it may just be
the typeface used that  makes a K look a bit like an H.
