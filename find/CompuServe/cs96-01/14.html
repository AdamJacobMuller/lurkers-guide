<pre>      &lt;Quoting Pat Russell to JMS&gt;:

      &gt;Walter is doing a great job with Bester.  Understand we
      &gt;will  see him again this season.  Looking forward to
      &gt;it.  Tell him he does "rotten" well.   

     Yeah, Walter's doing a great job with it.  So far we're
going to see Bester twice  this season at least, which I'm
very happy about.
