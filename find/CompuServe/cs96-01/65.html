<pre>	&lt;I'll be taking a business trip to LA next week and Ill 
have tuesday afternoon to look around.  I was wondering if the 
Warner Studios were open then for a visit?  I dont get to LA very 
often, It is usually San Diego. I just thought I would ask.   
Thanks.&gt;

     We don't shoot on the Warners lot, so it's kind of a moot 
question (the facilities we do have, across town, aren't set up for 
tours, I'm afraid).
