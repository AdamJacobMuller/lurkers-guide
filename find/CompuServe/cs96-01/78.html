<pre> Tom LeCompte &lt;76711.572@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; If you don't mind, could you clarify the role of telepaths in the
&gt; EA military? And certainly CDR Ivanova lives in perpetual fear
&gt; that she'll be found out and kicked out - or is her sin in the
&gt; eyes of EA more in *lying* about her telepathy than in having it? 
&gt; (Which brings to mind something else - where do the people who
&gt; are "not even a P-1" end up?

     The military uses telepaths on a loan-out or special intelligence
basis, rather than within the core units of soldiers and officers.

                                                                  jms
