<pre> Joel Hilke &lt;102354.1702@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is that not so?

     No, only once has that been done, running "Hunter, Prey" in this
last batch to set up the new ones.  The rest of the time, reruns are
set up so that the stations have new shows to run in the sweeps periods
(February, May, (sometimes July), and November).

                                                                  jms
