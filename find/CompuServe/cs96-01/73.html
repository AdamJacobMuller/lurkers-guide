<h3>Date: January 20, 1996 6:02:02 PM</h3>
<pre>&lt;A childrens show over here has just featured a set visit to B5, 
what episode was being made while they were there (A clapperboard 
has the director as John C. Flinn III and the date as 11/14/95)?&gt;

     That would be Ceremonies of Light and Dark.  What else was shown?

                                                                   jms
