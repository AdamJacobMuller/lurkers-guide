<H2> Babylon 5 Movie !?!?!?!?		</H2>
<h3>Date: January 16, 1996 6:30:03 PM</h3>
<pre>     There've been discussions about a DTV project, a one-off, but 
nothing's set yet.  The ratings are doing well; the reason some 
(not many) stations have time-shifted the show to later hours is 
that independent stations only have 2 hours per night of prime 
time, 8-10 p.m., doing news at 10.  More and more they're tied up 
with pre-set agreements with Fox, UPN and WB, so anything else has 
to get put into later slots.
