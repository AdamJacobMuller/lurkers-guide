<pre> Kathleen E. Ross &lt;102747.3373@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Can anyone confirm or deny this runor?
&gt; Does anyone know how this rumored demise will effect Bablon - 5
&gt; (and Kung-Fu: The Legend Continues)? Does anyone have knowledge of
&gt; an existing still?

      PTEN is being restructured; if it should cease to be, WB
domestic syndication will take over all shows like B5 and Kung Fu.

      I'll try to put up a white star gif soonish...there may be one
here now.

                                                                  jms
