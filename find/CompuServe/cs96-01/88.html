<pre> Chad Underkoffler &lt;102512.1310@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; 1) [Out of Story] Did you, as chief cook and bottle washer,
&gt; decide against persuing the G/T relationship too far because
&gt; Jerry and Andrea were married out here in the Real World(tm)? 2)
&gt; [In the Story] Did the unTalia "shunt" Talia v.1.0 away from
&gt; Garibaldi? If so, why?
&gt; Fear of discovery?
&gt; Optimum choice of targets?
&gt; 3) [In the Story] Did Talia v.1.0 just genuinely dislike Michael?
&gt; 4) Some combination thereof?
&gt; BTW, has the Orkin man paid a visit to n'grath?

     Basically, the answer to all of the questions is "no."

                                                                  jms
