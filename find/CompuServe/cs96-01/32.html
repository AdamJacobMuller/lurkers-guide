<pre>      &lt;Quoting Paul Owen to JMS&gt;:

      &gt;As we are waiting for Season 3 here in the UK I was
      &gt;just wondering why are the  Rangers here at all?? where
      &gt;is the Minbari military in all of this , ? Is this
      &gt;another  twist in an already superbly convoluted
      &gt;plot???.  Is this going to become clearer in S3

     This is one of the things that's better gone into in the
show.
