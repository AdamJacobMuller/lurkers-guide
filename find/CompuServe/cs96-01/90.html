<pre> Joel Hilke &lt;102354.1702@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Or do sitcoms go to reruns as often as B5 and the treks and I
&gt; just don't notice since, well, they are moronic sitcoms and B5
&gt; isn't? Oh well - what's the run-down on the reruns - season 3 I
&gt; assume?

     I don't know the rerun schedule yet; they tell me this stuff as
late as possible to keep me from going ballistic, I think....

                                                                  jms
