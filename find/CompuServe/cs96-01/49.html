<pre>     I'll say one thing about one of those eps, but I won't say which 
one; when people hear what it appears to be about, the immediate 
reaction is going to be "Oh, god, they're not doing THAT are they?" 
and there'll be a lot of sarcasm and head shaking...until the 
episode airs, and folks see that what it's about...is *not* what it's 
about...and I think it'll be a very popular episode thereafter.
