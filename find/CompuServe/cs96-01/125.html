<pre> Philip Hornsey &lt;74053.2101@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; How are we among syndicated dramas?
&gt; How happy is WB?

     Usually we're in the top ten of all syndicated dramas; WB is
making money on the show's advertising, which is their main concern, so
insofar as I have heard, they're happy.

                                                                  jms
