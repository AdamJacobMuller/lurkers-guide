<pre>      &lt;Quoting The Jawa/Jawa #2 to JMS&gt;:

      &gt;This is a catastrophe of immense proportions!!
      &gt;IVANOVA MADE A KIDIST REMARK IN "TKO"!
      &gt;The scene: father's memorial.
      &gt;The remark: "...pouting in that way that only 13
      &gt;     can..."
      &gt;I don't know what to do.
      &gt;Ivanova seemed so *decent!*
      &gt;Joe, Joe, how could you let that slip PAST??
      &gt;What should we do?

     Point One: the script was written by Larry DiTillio, not
me.

     Point Two: the comment is essentially correct; ain't
nobody can pout like a 13  year old.
