     "57th out of 75 shows."  Just to correct you: that figure is from
the Christmas period rerun, which was low for everybody, and second,
it's not out of 75 shows, that's usually just the top batch they list,
it's 57th that week out of 275 syndicated shows.  Usually we do in the
40s out of 275, which puts us in the top 20% of all syndicated shows.

                                                                  jms
