In "Gropos" Garabaldi tells Dodger of all the weird stuff that's been 
happening to him, and most of the references I recognized from events 
on the show, except when he mentions meeting a lady, "the kind a guy 
like me normally doesn't have a chance with" (paraphrasing from 
memory).  Who is he talking about?&gt;

     That would be Talia.
