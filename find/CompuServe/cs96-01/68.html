<pre>     Not only did "Messages From Earth" come out as well as I'd 
hoped or thought it would, it came out *better*.  It is, 
potentially, either one of the best or the best thing we've ever 
done in the whole series to date. There are some episodes that 
come close this season, like "Point of No Return," "A Late 
Delivery From Avalon," "Sic Transit Vir" (for absolutely different 
reasons), and parts of "Dust to Dust," but so far -- at least until 
the CGI for "Severed Dreams" is finished, which has at least a shot 
at knocking "Messages" out of the box -- "Messages" is as close to 
perfect as we've ever come.

     Like "The Coming of Shadows" there's a real sense of a *story* 
being told, and major events happening at breakneck speed.  It's 
just a joy to watch.
