<pre>&lt;&gt;&gt;And the triluminary mark is an implant, which reacts that way in 
the presence of shadows or their direct "employees."

In that case, why did it appear on Delenn's forehead during 
Sinclair's interrogation at the Battle of the Line?  And why was it 
on the Grey Council member's forehead at the end of "And the Sky 
Full of Stars"?&gt;

      It's also the insignia of the Grey Council, given its long 
tradition of safeguarding.  They use it at certain times and under 
certain conditions.
