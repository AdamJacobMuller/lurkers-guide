<pre>      &lt;Quoting Rebecca Eschliman to JMS&gt;:

      &gt;Whether Centauri, Narn, Minbari, Drazi, Vorlon, If  one
      &gt;stops to think about the fact that these civilizations
      &gt;have not developed  against a background of human
      &gt;interactions it is a lot more difficult to assign a 
      &gt;morality to their actions.  Therefore one has to
      &gt;examine one's own ethical beliefs  is contrast to
      &gt;whatever reactions we have to your other civilazations
      &gt;and one  hopes, to think about why we believe what we
      &gt;do.

      I think it's not enough just to *have* non-Earth
civilizations.  First you have to  explore them, and set them
up as real, individual forces. Second, it becomes  easy to
say, "Well, I don't have to think about this particular issue,
it's just an alien  thing.  Isn't it interesting that they
should feel this way?"  It's more effective in  some way to
make the *really* challenging issues ones that directly
involve  humans...it doesn't leave us as much wriggle room to
avoid considering the  issue.
