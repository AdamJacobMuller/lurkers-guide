     They're dead as doornails.

<pre>      {Regarding Majel Barrett Roddenberry going back into 
       acting}

      I'd just like to say that Majel did a great job for us
on B5, and we are hoping  we can come up with other opportuni-
ties for the character to return.  I know that  Majel is
interested in pursuing other acting gigs outside ST, and I
wish her all the  best.  I think other shows would do well to
utilize her abilities; everyone had a  great time working with
her, and she should be recognized for work other than  ST.

       Perhaps folks should let the producers of other shows
know that she's  available now, and interested, and that
they'd like to see her appear on other  shows from time to
time.  (Maybe someone could drop the folks at X-Files of 
Space a note in their forums....)
