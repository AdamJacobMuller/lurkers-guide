<pre> Nigel Nixon &lt;100666.2174@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Ou est la mauvaise Filles?

     All an extra does is walk across a room, that's all.  There are
no lines, no performances, just standing in a room or walking across. 
There aren't a lot of requirements for that, it has nothing to do with
the story, so I don't quite understand what's got you so exercised
about this.

                                                                  jms
