<H2>Q: Error in Pilot show?</H2>
<h3>Date: 24-Jan-96 12:49:10</h3>
<pre> John R. Finnan (Ireland) &lt;100012.3073@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Well?
&gt; Can you tell us what it was?
&gt; Or has it disappeared from memory?

      It's the overhead shot of the courtroom; we didn't have a second
establisher, so we used the one of Kyle even though Sinclair was on
the stand.

                                                                  jms
