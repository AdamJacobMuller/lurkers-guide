<pre> Kenneth Porter &lt;76161.3013@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; How can you have a surprise checkmate with two apparently
&gt; chess-knowledgeable onlookers? BTW, how many of the cast and crew
&gt; have played chess?

     Actually, I play chess, though not as much as I used to...and
believe me, there are *many* times I've been surprised and ambushed by
a move I absolutely did NOT see coming.  (I'm also a sucker for a
fool's mate.)

                                                                  jms
