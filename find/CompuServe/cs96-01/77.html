<pre> Barbara Pfieffer &lt;72302.2453@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Would Warners do that?
&gt; Or are you afraid they'll do the same thing they did to us (and
&gt; you) last year?

     I haven't yet been apprised of the air schedule past February, so
I'm as much in the dark as anyone else just now.  I'm hoping for the
best.

                                                                  jms
