<pre>	&lt;&lt;"Oh, god, they're not doing THAT are they?" and there'll be
a lot of sarcasm and head shaking...until the episode airs, and folks 
see that what it's about...is *not* what it's about...and I think 
it'll be a very popular episode thereafter&gt;

	So the episode we see will not be the episode we see, nor
will it be the episode seen by anyone else???&gt;

     Go to your room.
