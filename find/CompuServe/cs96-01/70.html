<H2> Quick Q about Mindwiping		</H2>
<h3>Date: January 19, 1996 1:44:15 PM</h3>
<pre>   &lt;I've seen messages where you explained what your position is on 
the Death Penalty versus Life Imprisonment. I was wondering, if the 
technology of Mindwiping was available, would you be in favour of 
it?&gt;

     I actually don't know how I'd stand on that...to render the 
argument correctly in the show, I've had to "convince" myself on 
both sides of the issue.  When it happens for real, I'll have an 
opinion.
