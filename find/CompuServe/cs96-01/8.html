<pre>      &lt;Quoting Daniel M. Upton to JMS&gt;:

      &gt;Speaking of Trek/B5 crossovers did you notice that the
      &gt;Star Fleet Admiral who is  apparently involved in a
      &gt;conspiracy to take over the Federation government 
      &gt;because it isn't taking the Founder/Gem Haddar threat
      &gt;seriously enough is  played by the same actor who does
      &gt;Gen. Hague?

      Yeah, I caught that, and the description in TV
Guide...y'know, this is really  starting to bug me....
