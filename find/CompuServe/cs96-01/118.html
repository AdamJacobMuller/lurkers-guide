<pre> Tony Scarpelli &lt;71535.306@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Can you please get your people to put the name of the episode at
&gt; the end? Can they, or we, other humans, forgive such a creature?

     Thanks.  The only problem with putting the title at the end of
the episode, in the closing credits, is that many stations chop off the
end credits altogether.  So it's best to have them in the beginning.

                                                                  jms
