<pre>      &lt;Quoting Susan Law to JMS&gt;:

      &gt;Saw your post on rastb5 a couple of days ago - enjoyed
      &gt;it.  Anyhow regarding B5  merchandise that you're
      &gt;considering - how about the Ranger pins -  any chance 
      &gt;of those being available?  I'd sure spring for one.  

     Not a bad idea; those would be expensive to make, though,
so I'm not sure if  it'd work.  We'll see....
