<pre> John Hardin &lt;74076.22@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I am very interested in the military in B5, what they are doing?
&gt; Does the Earth Alliance military simply follow the President, or
&gt; does the Admiralty have its own mind? Will the EA do anything that
&gt; the Senators and President says? What does the EA military feel
&gt; about the loss of its telepaths? What does the EA military think
&gt; about the station B5? You basically said the Manbire military is
&gt; under the control of the shadow (rather simple view I know) is
&gt; the earth military the same way?

     1.  I am very interested in the military in B5, what
     they are doing?

All kinds of things.  Some good, some not so.

     Does the Earth Alliance military simply follow the
     President, or does the Admiralty have its own mind?

Any military must respect the chain of command.  You can't have the
military setting its own agenda.  The president proposes, the military
disposes.

     Will the EA do anything that the Senators and President
     says?

Well, the EA military must obey the President as Commander in Chief. 
The EA government is always quibbling.  They're like that.

     What does the EA military feel about the loss of its
     telepaths?

The EA military hasn't lost any telepaths that I know of.  Don't know
what this refers to.

     What does the EA military think about the station B5?

"Cushy job.  And they're a bunch of loose cannons over there.  Maybe
we better see if we can help straighten things out."

     You basically said the Manbire military is under the
     control of the shadow (rather simple view I know) is
     the earth military the same way?

No, I never said that, and the Minbari are NOT under Shadow control.

     My next question is on getting your show on military
     T.V.  The network is called AFARTS, Armed Forces
     A(something) Radio and Television something something.

     Anyway, AFARTS does not show commercials. After not
     seeing stateside commercials for over 5 years, you
     actually start missing them, anyway, they don't do
     advertisements, and basically ask for the show.  DS9,
     Bay watch etc. either give it to AFARTS or gives it to
     them for next to nothing.

     I was wondering if you were even willing to enterin the
     ideal.  If so, we have to start a write in "beg
     campaign" to get worthless AFARTS (actually they are
     O.K., but it is a sailors right to complain) to talk to
     someone.  Last big thing was getting the Rush Limbaugh
     show, on the radio, that had to go to congress, before
     the FoB plants/sympatiers in the pentagon/Admiralty
     would allow it.

I'm up for it, we've talked to Warners about it, but it's their call,
not mine.

                                                                  jms
