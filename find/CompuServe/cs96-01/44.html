<pre>     His novel is about Babylon 5.  You were expecting talking mice?

     (To say more is to give it away; suffice to say that Stirling's 
book has some really nice stuff with Garibaldi, Londo and Ivanova in 
particular, though the other characters are treated nicely as well.)

                                                                 jms
