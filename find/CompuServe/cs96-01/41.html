      &lt;Quoting Michael Milutinovic to JMS&gt;:

      &gt;Are the Sheridan, Garibaldi and the others keeping an
      &gt;eye on Morden?

     They do when he's there, or at least they try to, but
he's not there a lot, and  when he is...well, see for your-
self....

      &gt;&lt;snip&gt;
      &gt;Lennier revealed to Sheridan et. al. at the start of
      &gt;series 2 the issue of  discovering Minbari souls in
      &gt;(some?) humans as the reason for surrendering at  the
      &gt;climax of the war.
      &gt;
      &gt;My question is:- does Sinclair know this too? Do the
      &gt;Minbari know how much he  knows, and if so do they mind
      &gt;now? If this all gets sorted out in the much  antici-
      &gt;pated series 3, you can just say "it's in series 3" if
      &gt;you like!

     Sinclair knows now.  And the triluminary mark is an
implant, which reacts that  way in the presence of shadows or
their direct "employees."
