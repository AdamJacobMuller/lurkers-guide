<pre>      &lt;Quoting Michael Guenther to JMS&gt;:

      &gt;I just saw Legacies last night and I have a question
      &gt;for you concerning the young  Telepath introduced in
      &gt;the story. Now that  Alison and Sinclair are on the
      &gt;Minbari  homeworld has Sinclair met her since then? 
      &gt;Will we see more of her?  I'm sure  a P10 would come in
      &gt;handy for the coming struggle...

     There are no current plans for that character, no.
