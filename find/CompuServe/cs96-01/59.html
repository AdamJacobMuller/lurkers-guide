<H2> "Star Lost" TV Series		</H2>

<pre>     "...never once did he (Harlan) disown that effort (`City 
on the Edge of Forever')...."

     The only thing wrong with that statement is that it 
isn't true.

     Harlan only kept his own name on City after Roddenberry 
pleaded with him to do so; further, it was Harlan's *original* 
script, not the rewrite, that earned the Writers Guild of 
America award that year...and, in fact, he has *always* 
maintained in print, and in every interview that he's given, 
that he is in no way responsible for the televised version.  
You are, basically, repeating a canard that Gene repeated at 
cons, that was not in any way, manner, shape or form the 
truth.

     If you want to get the documented facts in this case, not 
the mythos that's grown up around it, I suggest you get the 
Borderlands Press version of "City," which includes memos, all 
versions of the script and outline, and afterwords by Nimoy, 
Kelley, Koenig, Takai and others involved in the episode.
