<H2>B5 tapes in Aus</H2>
<h3>Date: 23-Jan-96 11:55:43</h3>
<pre> Elaine E Brown &lt;100353.3702@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Do you know how many will be released and at what intervals?

     I actually don't know the release situation vis a vis the
Australia tapes; what happens in international distribution is always a
surprise to me, and frankly this is the first time I've heard of it. 
I'll try to find out, though.  And thanks, for the words, and the news.

                                                                  jms
