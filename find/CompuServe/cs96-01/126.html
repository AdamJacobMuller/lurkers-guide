<H2>Where do baby narn come</H2>
<h3>Date: 31-Jan-96 15:34:37</h3>
<pre> John McAuley &lt;100260.412@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Where does she carry the baby?
&gt; Where does it come out of?
&gt; Is it a proper baby or is it a wriggly octopussy thing that turns
&gt; into a humanoid later? How big is it?
&gt; Do they live in water?
&gt; Do baby boy Centauri have to wear wigs?

     Ask your mother.
