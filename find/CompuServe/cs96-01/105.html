<H2>B5 Action Fig. - 'ish!</H2>
<h3>Date: 27-Jan-96 20:28:20</h3>
<pre> Antony Jackson &lt;100025.2004@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; What is this I hear that Henry Unger Associates have been
&gt; licenced to produce Babylon 5 statuettes? Can you tell me a bit
&gt; more about what they will be doing, planned release date etc.? 
&gt; I understand that the same firm also do action figures for other
&gt; licences, if they were to ask (and you are happy with their work
&gt; on the statuettes) would you allow them to produce action
&gt; figures?

     I haven't heard about this yet, so can't comment.  If it does go
ahead, I'll be involved in consulting on it, so I'll have a better
sense of this at that time.

                                                                  jms
