<pre>     We literally just signed the contracts; we now have to
get a space for the  fanclub operations, set up the www page
(which we hope will be up during the  next batch of episodes),
hire the people we've selected to run it, and then we can  put
the word out.  As with everything else, we always make sure
we're prepared  before going forward with anything.
