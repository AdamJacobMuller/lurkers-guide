<pre>      &lt;Quoting Sharon Foster to JMS&gt;:

      &gt;Forgive me if this has been asked a dozen times by now,
      &gt;but a friend of mine  wants to know if Harlan's story
      &gt;in next month's Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction, called 
      &gt;"Midnight in the Sunken Cathedral", is a Babylon 5
      &gt;story and if so, is it canonical.   He says it was the
      &gt;working title of an episode that never got made.

    No, it's not a B5 story; he liked the title, and used it
there instead.
