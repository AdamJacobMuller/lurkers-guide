<H2> ST Book from J Friedmann  </H2>
<h3>Date: January 01, 1996 3:03:27 AM</h3>
<pre>     At last count there were only a few copies of Ellison's
CITY ON THE EDGE OF  FOREVER limited-edition hardcover,
containing various versions of the script,  outlines, essays
by Nimoy and Takai and Koenig and Kelley and others.  You  can
order one by calling 1-800-528-3310.  They're $75 plus $5
shipping and  handling.  (And they're gorgeous, well-made
books, btw, well worth the money.)
