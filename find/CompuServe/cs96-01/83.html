<h3>Date: 23-Jan-96 11:55:46</h3>
<pre>       As y'all know, next week the latest batch of new episodes
begins to air.  The first one up, "Voices of Authority," is an absolute
hoot; if you've been looking to bring in other viewers, that's a good
one to start them with, because it sets up a lot of what's going to
happen in this episode, it has a lot of background, and it's a lot of
fun.

       The next two are somewhat more straightforward, stand-alones
(to some extent; there's some arc stuff there, however, which becomes
more important later).  Then the last two in this batch represent some
of the best work we've ever done, "Messages From Earth" and "Point of
No Return."  They follow directly on the footsteps of "Voices," so
those three together would be great for new viewers.

       Second, today is Michael O'Hare's first day of shooting here on
the B5 stages for the two-parter, featuring his return to the station
from Minbar, and propels him into the center of attention for most of
the two parts. Everyone's having a great time so far, he and Bruce have
been hanging out a lot, and the episode should be a real toad-strangler
when it's finished.

                                                                  jms
