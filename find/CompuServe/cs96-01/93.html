<pre> Gerald Himmelein &lt;100417.3703@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is that a Good or a Bad thing?
&gt; Will it affect the video tape gridlock in some way?

     No, it'll have no effect on the videos either way, and is
probably neither a good nor a bad thing; it should be a wash.

                                                                  jms
