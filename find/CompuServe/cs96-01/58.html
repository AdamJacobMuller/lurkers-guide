<H2> Opening credits season 3		</H2>
<h3>Date: January 14, 1996 4:53:11 PM</h3>
<pre>&lt;Is their any significance to the fact that only half the cast is 
turning their heads on the opening credits?  I believe it's 
Garibaldi, Zack, G'Kar, and Vir.  Does that indicate that their 
stories "turn" this year also or that the story turns around them?&gt;

     No, I don't think even I could ever manage to be that obscure.

                                                                jms
