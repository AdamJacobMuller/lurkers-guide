<pre>      &lt;Quoting GREG LASH to JMS&gt;:

      &gt;I understand that the trade hardcover edition of THE
      &gt;CITY ON THE  EDGE OF FOREVER has been cancelled. What's
      &gt;up with that?

     Borderlands Press will not be doing the trade paperback
because it did not  have the final rights to do so, and other
problems during the production of the  book -- the high number
of typos and errors made that delayed the book's  publication
-- led to the rights being taken elsewhere.
