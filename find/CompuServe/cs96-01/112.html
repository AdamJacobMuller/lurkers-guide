<pre> Gerald Himmelein &lt;100417.3703@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Bad news for John Ostrander, then?
&gt; Or will you make some room in your brain to fit that project in?

     No, I wouldn't be doing the Grimjack project until *after* I'd
finished this season's scripts in late February.

                                                                  jms
