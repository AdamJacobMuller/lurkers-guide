<pre> Philip Hornsey &lt;74053.2101@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Why was Lennier chosen to serve Delenn, what set him apart?
&gt; Was Knight One's comment about "Maybe we're still inside"
&gt; something we should worry about, or just the ravings of a damaged
&gt; mind? What ever happened to the Home Guard?
&gt; Why did Jack (Garabaldi's aid not Sebastian) say "I've never met
&gt; a Psi Cop before" to Bester when we know he was up to his neck in
&gt; the Conspiracy? Lastly, what is Bester's first name?

     Home Guard found other venues.  Bester's first name is Alfred. 
And Jack was speaking correctly; his contacts were not psi-corps in
nature.

                                                                  jms
