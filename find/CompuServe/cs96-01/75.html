<pre> Nigel Nixon &lt;100666.2174@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Ou est la mauvaise Filles?

     Basically, whether the show is a new one or an old one, it
doesn't much enter into it...as a syndicated show we take any PR we can
get.  We didn't go to them, they came to us and said they wanted to do
it.  We said yes. That was kind of the end-all and be-all of it.

                                                                  jms
