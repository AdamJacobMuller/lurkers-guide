<pre> Philip Hornsey &lt;74053.2101@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; When the soulhunter said "You would do such a thing?"
&gt; to Delenn when he peeked into her soul, was he referring to the
&gt; change she made in Chrysalis or *something else*? I know Neroon
&gt; detests Delenn, but is he likely more friendly to Ambassador
&gt; Sinclair? May I assume that you approved having G'Kar butcher a
&gt; zillion people (was 10 billion a misprint?) in the Prologue? If
&gt; so, should we have *any* sympathy *at all* for the Narn (I now
&gt; don't) and will you bring up something in the show to grey them
&gt; up?

     You'll hear the soul hunter's line again this season, in a
flashback, that may illuminate this; and there's more about Neroon as
well this year. As for G'Kar...people do things in war they can always
justify.

                                                                  jms
