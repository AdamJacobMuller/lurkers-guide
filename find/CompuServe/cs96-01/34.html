<pre>      &lt;Quoting Gerald Himmelein to JMS&gt;:

      &gt;{Well, we'll be waiting for her reappearance (or will
      &gt;she only appear in a  "throwaway line" like the
      &gt;resolution of the situation on Ragesh 3 in Season 1?).}

     No, if we go into what happened, and where she is, it
kinda behooves us to  show her.
