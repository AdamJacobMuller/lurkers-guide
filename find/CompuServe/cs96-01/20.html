<pre>      &lt;Quoting Lynn Dimock to ALL&gt;:

      &gt;I'm sorry, I know this is thread drift, but my team is
      &gt;getting its butt whopped at the  Fiesta Bowl and I am
      &gt;ready to scream. It's not so much the score as the way 
      &gt;three Florida guys have had to be hauled off the field
      &gt;so far (how many football  players do you hear of with
      &gt;dislocated *hips* for crying out loud), and the general
      &gt;attitude of the Nebraska players. And yes, if my guys
      &gt;were acting like that I'd still  be upset (though, to
      &gt;be honest, not as much).

     You are not ready for victory.
