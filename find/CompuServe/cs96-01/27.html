<pre>      &lt;Quoting Bert Johnson to JMS&gt;:

      &gt;I have been going throught the AVI files in my new B5
      &gt;screen saver and came  upon the Streib.  Are they named
      &gt;in recogntion of Whitley Streiber's aliens in his 
      &gt;books?  They look the same.

     It's a nod, yes; and the comics were/are meant to be
complementary, within  the B5 universe but not required to
follow the show.
