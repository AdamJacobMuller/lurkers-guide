<pre> Mike Biracree &lt;71776.3456@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is this true?

     I don't know how that would've gotten past me...I don't recall
seeing that in the draft...either I was tired when reading, or it was
added later.

                                                                  jms
