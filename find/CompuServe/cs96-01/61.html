<pre>     &lt;Mind you this does bring a question to mind:  Will there, 
assuming the series reaches the end of Year 5 on tv, and there are 
novels during this period...will there be novels in the B5 universe 
*after* the series has come to its end?  Is this something that you 
wouldn't mind, or is it sometning that you wouldn't want to see, 
because of the continuity headaches and the creation of new material 
that likely would fall outside the context and scope of the series 
and the "B5 Bible"?&gt;

      It's something I really haven't had time to consider at this 
point.
