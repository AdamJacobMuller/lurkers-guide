<pre>      &lt;Quoting Neville White to JMS&gt;:

      &gt;I hope you don't mind me asking, but I was wondering
      &gt;the other day whether  there was any come-back on the
      &gt;woman from Garibaldi's past that we saw in  "Survivors"
      &gt;back in series one... security for president Santiago,
      &gt;yet he got  assassinated at the end of series one...

     No, we haven't established what happened to her, but we
will in time.
