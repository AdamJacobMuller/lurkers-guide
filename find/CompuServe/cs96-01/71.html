<H2> Q: Laurie Anderson		</H2>
<h3>Date: January 19, 1996 11:05:05 PM</h3>
<pre>    &lt;I was listening to Laurie Anderson's CD ("The Ugly one with the 
Jewels") this evening, and a few references cropped up which made my 
wonder if you had the CD, or had heard it??
    Apart from the weird voice modulation (not too unlike Kosh) which 
she calls her "Voice of Authority", she also recounts a story where a 
little girl is told by her nutty/psychic/religious aunt that doomsday 
is coming and that the world will end "In Fire!". (These two words 
being given in the musical 'Voice'.) There may have been a few other 
oddities, but these stuck out.
    Isn't co-incidence a strange thing?&gt;

     Haven't heard the CD; yeah, some themes keep coming up in odd 
places.
