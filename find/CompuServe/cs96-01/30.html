<H2> B5: Promoting B5       </H2>

<pre>      &lt;Quoting Peter Sathis to ALL&gt;:

      &gt;Just curious, but I was wondering why none of the cast
      &gt;members have done the  talk show circuit? It couldn't
      &gt;hurt. I also heard that when Harlan was on Tom 
      &gt;Snyder's show he made no mention of B5 at all.

     Once again you make broad statements: "none of the cast
members have  done the talk show circuit."  Not correct. 
Bruce has done the Stephanie Miller  show, showed up on the
Tonight Show, the Mike and Maddie show (same there  for Jerry
Doyle, who's done other talk shows including several network
morning  shows, such as the the FX cable network show),
they've all done various national  radio shows, and other talk
shows.

     So for starters you're not correct; they're doing some,
and we're working on  doing more.  The problem is that most
talk shows want major, recognized stars  from hit network
shows, and syndication doesn't get a lot of attention there.
