<H2> Babylon 5 Movie !?!?!?!?		</H2>
<h3>Date: January 17, 1996 4:05:11 PM</h3>
<pre>      Well, any time you move to a later slot it's going to affect 
the numbers.  As for WB moving the show into later slots for 
purposes alleged in a fanzine...for starters, WB has *zero* control 
over where the stations run the show.  It's all determined locally.  
So for starters the story is bogus. Second, on the "expensive" 
line, our episodes cost just under $900,000 per, as opposed to $1.2 
to $1.6 million per episode (or more) on DS9 and Voyager. Work it out.

                                                                   jms
