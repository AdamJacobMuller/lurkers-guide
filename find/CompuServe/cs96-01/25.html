<pre>      &lt;Quoting Jeff Frank&gt;:

      &gt;Just to pick a nit that drives me up the fraggen wall: 
      &gt;The millennia doesn't end  on December 31, 1999, but on
      &gt;December 31, 2000.  There was no year 0 so the  end of
      &gt;the first thousand years occurred on December 31, 1000.

     Funny thing is, some mathematicians disagree with this
assessment; no,  there was no year 0, but there was a year 10
and 20 and 30 and so on (though  all, as you note, assigned in
retrospect).  So some of them have taken the  position that
the first century was simply short one year, rather than
rolling every  other century back one year.
