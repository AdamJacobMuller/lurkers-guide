<H2> "Survivors" question...  </H2>

<pre>      &lt;Quoting John M. Kahane to JMS&gt;:

      &gt;I have always thought that Lianna Kemmer  was an
      &gt;important person in the life of Michael Garibaldi, and
      &gt;"Survivors" left a few  threads hanging.  It'll be good
      &gt;to see or at least find out what happened to Lianna  in
      &gt;the aftermath of Santiago's death.  If nothing else, I
      &gt;don't think she was on  board Earthforce One when it
      &gt;blew, since she'd be doing the work on Io station 
      &gt;proper, right?

     That's correct; as with her arrival at B5, she would've
been handling the  advance work on Io prior to Santiago's
arrival.
