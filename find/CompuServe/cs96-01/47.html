<pre>      &lt;Quoting John M. Kahane to JMS&gt;:

      &gt;Isn't this the one that  has Shadow ship and stuff in
      &gt;it?  I don't know all that much about it, but is there 
      &gt;more that you can say about this episode and the Bester
      &gt;role?

     Could, yeah, but I'd rather let that episode reveal
itself...there's not much I can  say about it that wouldn't
spoil it for people.
