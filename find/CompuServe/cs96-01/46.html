<pre>      &lt;Quoting SysOp Dupa T. Parrot to JMS&gt;:

      &gt;In "The Fall Of Night", in the fighter jock's locker
      &gt;room we see Keffer wearing a  blue scarf with white
      &gt;stars. Meanwhile, "Mitch" is wearing what looks like a
      &gt;white  scarf with red stars.  Is the scarf a squadron
      &gt;thing or something else?

     I do believe they relate to squadrons, yes.
