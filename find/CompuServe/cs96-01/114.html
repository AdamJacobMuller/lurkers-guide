<pre> Mark D. Smith &lt;70254.107@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is this true?

     I haven't read the book since the galleys, and don't have a copy
of the finished book yet, so this will have to wait until it arrives. 
I don't recall the exact specifics of the paragraphs in question.

                                                                  jms
