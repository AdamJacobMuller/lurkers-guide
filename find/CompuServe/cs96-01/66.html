<h3>Date: January 18, 1996 1:08:17 AM</h3>
<pre>     You just have to brace yourself for the work, and burn through 
it by being somewhat monomanaical and obsessive.  It takes a toll, 
but in the end, it is or should be worth it, otherwise why do it?

     I've gotten used to handling work and deadlines, so it really 
doesn't bother me too much, unless I'm really under the gun.  Thus 
far, I've written something like 170 *produced* TV scripts, maybe 
a bit more, and by the end of this season will have written 49 B5 
scripts.  This season, in writing 22 episodes, not counting first 
drafts and revisions which would double the figure easily, I'll 
have written about 1,000 pages in less than 10 months. That's two 
full-sized novels.

     I try not to think about that too much....
