<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;75063.3305@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Question: Do you feel that anyone else in your story would
&gt; qualify as a True Seeker (for other reasons, or even the same
&gt; reasons)?

      There are elements of the true seeker in many of our characters;
Sinclair for one, G'Kar certainly (now that he's been enlightened a
bit), and Sheridan didn't start out that way, but in his own stumbling
way has slowly begin growing into that.

                                                                  jms
