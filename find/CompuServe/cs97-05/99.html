<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; it sounded good &lt;g&gt; Which ep would have been?

      Well...I don't usually comment on this, but...if I had known
*with absolute certainty* that there would be a season 5, then season 4
would have ended with 418, "Intersections in Real Time."  So you only
pull 4 episodes forward, really.  You'll understand when you see it.

                                                                  jms
