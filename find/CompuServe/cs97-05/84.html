<pre> Tom Knudsen &lt;72347.1626@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Did he REALLY have an epiphany and realize he belonged to the
&gt; religious caste? Or, did he just come to believe in Delenn and her
&gt; "rightness" to lead the Minbari so much that he was willing to
&gt; die and renounce his caste to prove her point for her and allow
&gt; her to survive?

      Whether it was true or not, he knew his actions would bring the
castes back together...so out of respect for the dead, best to leave
the issue unresolved, and accept his gesture for what it was.

                                                                  jms
