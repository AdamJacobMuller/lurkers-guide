      Thanks.  The Sheridan stuff was fun, in that I got to play
Sheridan as the one being manipulative for a change, smart for a
change...not just Londo or the usual suspects.  It made for a nifty
change of pace.

      And yeah, Mira brought a lot of truth to this episode...and will
bring even more in next week.

                                                                  jms
