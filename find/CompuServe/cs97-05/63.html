<pre> Craig M. Bobchin &lt;102354.3246@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; If, as you and all of us firmly believe, the Season five decision
&gt; won't be made till July, what plans have you put in place to
&gt; ensure that your story gets told? Will you show the last episode
&gt; (Farewell or Sleeping in Light) in S4 and will that allow you to
&gt; do Season 5 as you want or will it force some major re-writes
&gt; thereby causing you to change the arc a little?

       It's an easy answer.

       The final 4 would get aired in October.  If there's no season
5, then the fourth one aired is 422, "Sleeping in Light."

       If there is a season 5, 422 is yanked out of the mix and moved
down to occupy 522's slot, and we shoot 501 and get it done in time to
air in place of 422 in October.

                                                                  jms
