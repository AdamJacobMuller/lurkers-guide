<pre> Carl Cantarella &lt;105030.3700@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Curious question: How much more difficult is it tackling things
&gt; from syndication at the very onset as opposed to going the
&gt; network route?

      Carl...it's a crap shoot.  There ain't no logic to explain. 
It's a mug's game, and the rules and the money changes day to day, and
I can't figure it out on the best of days.

                                                                  jms
