<pre> Bob Koslosky &lt;102365.2062@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; At any rate, he did ask a question that I thought was relevant:
&gt; In the end, Delenn's White Star fleet completely overwhelms the
&gt; Drahk's - so why did she initially "retreat" in the first place?

      As she states in the episode, they were at that time
*surrounded* and if they turned to fire, would get destroyed. 
Firepower doesn't solve every problem; one good hand-held Lancet
missile can put down a full-sized cruiser if it hits right.  They were
in the MIDDLE of the Drakh, just as they said, and that's NOT a
defensible position.  They had to get away, outside that group, so they
could mount an offensive.  This they did.

      So re: Jenoff's comments...another example of a self-styled
critic who faults the show when the information is right there...the
problem is the perceiver, not the perceived.  I can't be held
responsible for critics not thinking through what's said right there on
camera.

                                                                  jms
