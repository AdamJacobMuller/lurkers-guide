<pre> Michael Nelson &lt;70403.1270@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Couldn't Lyta have gone to Sheridan or the Command Staff for help
&gt; instead of taking the Psi-Corp deal? Will Zack &amp; Lyta become an
&gt; item?

      I think Lyta had just emotionally gotten to the place where she
had to do something on her own rather than continuing to rely on the
kindness of strangers.

                                                                  jms
