<pre> Roseann M. Caputo &lt;103510.1542@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Wow, an exec admitted they were wrong?
&gt; Was there some sort of comet or eclipse or something???
&gt; End result, fans shaking their heads going, "Are you bloody
&gt; nuts?" PS: Joe, you're one of the few who might actually have an
&gt; interesting take on this, so here goes: If a person with multiple
&gt; personalities threatens to kill himself, is this a hostage
&gt; situation?

"It all makes me wonder if somedays you don't go running down the hall
screaming Ahhhhhh at the top of your lungs!"

      Done that.

                                                                  jms
