<pre> Darran Williams &lt;101656.2143@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Was it ever broadcast and considering it is 3 years old (only
&gt; Season 1 featured) are there any more B5 Behind-the-scenes
&gt; programs out there or planned?

       I think that's the one made for the US and broadcast here prior
to season 1 (with Walter Koenig, yes?).

                                                                  jms
