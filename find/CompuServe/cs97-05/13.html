<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;75063.3305@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; As I was watching the Daffy Duck cartoon, I wondered, "Given how
&gt; hard it is to fit all the good stuff into the forty some-odd
&gt; minutes of a given episode, why is Joe leaving this thing on for
&gt; so long?" Did you simply remember that cartoon, did you look for
&gt; it, or was it just coincidence? And what kind of drugs were you on
&gt; when you asked for those (not-so-)stock external CGI shots? If so,
&gt; why? Different actor for Lise?
&gt; Or did you want to get the *real* farewell, not the one with an
&gt; unstuck Garibaldi? Does this telepath virus happen to have any
&gt; connection to the spin off?

       Re: the cartoon...I'm a big WB cartoon fan, and knew that one
very well, and there were two places where it would've fit with the
story; the other one, which I almost used, was when you see two Daffy's
arguing with each other.

       Re: the CGI...we've been fairly conventional with the CGI in
recent seasons, we're trying to get a bit more adventurous.

       The Lise flashback material is all exactly as was filmed for
"Babylon Squared."  I think we used a few more pieces of the original
footage, but it was all stet.

       Re: Delenn...these episodes happen close to one another in
time, so you have to allow travel time for her to get to Minbar.

                                                                  jms
