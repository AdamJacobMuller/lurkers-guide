<pre> Deonaha M. Conlin &lt;102531.2627@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; LOTS more subversive??

      Good...'cause I think you'll like it.

      There is one drawback to some of this, though...I've heard that
some folks on far right/extremist radio stations have looked at some of
the stuff in the show lately and decided that it constitutes an
endorsement of the position that the government is fascist, and that
their pirate stations (voices of the resistance) are the way to go.  I
can only shake my head.

                                                                  jms
