<pre> Brian Kornfeld &lt;75703.1340@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is Lennier the true bridge between races?

      No, I wouldn't say Lennier is a bridge in any sense along those
lines.

      Delenn, you must understand, is a True Seeker, and among the
religious caste there isn't much more admirable than that...combined
with the fact that she *did* fulfill prophecy, she *was* the chosen of
Dukhat, she *did* help end the Shadow War...yeah, she's had some
problems here and there, but what important leader doesn't?  Any one of
those items would be a sufficient crown on a lifetime of
achievement...the cumulative effect is quite daunting and impressive.

                                                                  jms
