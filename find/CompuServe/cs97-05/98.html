<pre> Brian Kornfeld &lt;75703.1340@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; To clarify: I guess I meant to ask if Lennier is unusual for a
&gt; Minbari? Or, is his almost Zen-like attitude, coupled with a fine
&gt; sense of humor, and remarkable ability to "stretch" the truth,
&gt; mark him as a new generation of Minbari, bringing the best of
&gt; both races to his people?

      No, many Minbari share in those traits.

                                                                  jms
