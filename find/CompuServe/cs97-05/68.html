<pre> T.P. Chai &lt;104674.3064@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Joe, if there is a season 5 and 422 becomes 522, wouldn't that
&gt; leave season 4 with only 21 eps? is that OK with the contracts?

       No.  To repeat what I've said here several times, we would move
501 into 422's slot and make that the cliffhanger ending, then 502
becomes the first episode of season 5, and 422 is the last.  So each
season works out to 22 episodes.

                                                                  jms
