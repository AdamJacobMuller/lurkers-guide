<pre> Douglas Piligian &lt;70760.2440@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; If all broadcasts are being jammed to B5 except ISN, how could
&gt; everyone have seen the Rebo and Zooty episode that Londo was
&gt; talking about in RB&amp;L?

       Easy.  The incident Londo is mentioning happened prior to the
blackout. He never said it *just* happened, he said the *last* time
Rebo and Zooty did their routine, everybody was doing it.

                                                                  jms
