<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;75063.3305@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Are you still alive?
&gt; How did it go?
&gt; Did you remember to say, "Cut!"?

"I'm sincerely curious about how you found the experience of directing
your baby -- of being responsible for creating, writing, producing
*and* directing it."

      My main goal was not to embarrass myself overmuch.  I think I
came out okay.  I've now seen an editor's assembly of the material, and
it plays real nice.  Now I get to go in and make the director's cut,
which will to all intents and purposes also stand as the producer's
cut.

      The main thing is...this one is *exactly* the way I saw it in my
head. It has a somewhat different feel than prior episodes, though hard
to quantify. But I think it came out nicely.

                                                                  jms
