<pre> O. C. Alexander &lt;72623.3472@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Was it a conscious decision NOT to show Lise's husband when he
&gt; contacted Garibaldi? Is it perhaps that in a century in which
&gt; video communication is the rule, the outrageously rich and
&gt; powerful deliberately choose not to show themselves to
&gt; insignicant people when sending messages?

      As we'll learn shortly, he doesn't want his face seen around.

      But we'll see him soon enough.

      (And the voice belongs to Efram Zimbalist Jr.)
