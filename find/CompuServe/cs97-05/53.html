<pre> Jonathan Kass &lt;74130.443@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Was the result of the contest made public?

      Yeah, it was, and I know there was some press covering it...just
didn't get a lot of exposure.  It was a guy who came out and played a
Minbari.

                                                                  jms
