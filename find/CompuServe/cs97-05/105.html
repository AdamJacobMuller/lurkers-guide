<h3>Date: 28 May 1997 20:17:37 -0700</h3>
<pre> Kevin P. Kenney &lt;104102.352@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Should we expect the final word on re-editing the pilot to occur
&gt; with the renewal decision notice, or is there news on that front? 
&gt; Refa, Morden, Neroon: Have you always been this hard on secondary
&gt; characters, or is this a side effect of B5's epic structure?

      No new on the recut yet...and yeah, it's a hard show on the
recurring and secondary character.

      Ain't been much of a picnic for the big guys, either.

                                                                  jms
