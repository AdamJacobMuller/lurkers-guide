<pre> Phil Lenton &lt;100572.61@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is there a reason why Vir has been absent for so many episodes?
&gt; Was that a deliberate choice on your part, to have him be a sort
&gt; of "faceless" enemy and have his intructions carried by minions
&gt; (as in "Epiphanies") or is there something more sinister in it
&gt; and Clark is himself being manipualted?

      Yes, I wanted to keep Clark more a force than a person...and Vir
has just been off doing his usual Vir stuff...he's back this coming
week.

                                                                  jms
