<pre> Douglas Piligian &lt;70760.2440@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I don't think it's the stations so perhaps the problem comes from
&gt; your end?

       No, it's the new satellite uplink facility WB is using, which
is analog rather than digital, which was the case in the past.

                                                                  jms
