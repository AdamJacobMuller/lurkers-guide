<pre> Philip Hornsey &lt;74053.2101@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; This would be empire building that takes place *after* the final
&gt; scene of the final episode that you have said more than once you
&gt; have *clearly* in your mind? If so, would it be fair to
&gt; characterize a hypothetical Season Five as a 22 ep prelude to
&gt; "Crusade"?

       Negative; season 5 would take place in 2262, 19 years before
the "final scene" you mention.  And no, I wouldn't want season 5 to be
just a setup for the sequel; it was sketched out long before that
became any kind of possibility, and I have no interest in doing that
sort of thing.  We'd do one or two small things, but no more than that.

                                                                  jms
