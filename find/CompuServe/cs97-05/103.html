<H2>Length of TV movies?</H2>
<h3>Date: 28 May 1997 20:17:35 -0700</h3>
<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; If so, what will be the films' length?

      TNT is a commercial cable network, so there will be commercials.
As I recall, the running time to which I wrote the scripts was 94
minutes 10 seconds.

                                                                  jms
