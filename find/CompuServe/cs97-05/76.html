<pre> Douglas Piligian &lt;70760.2440@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; So have you already written that episode?

       No, 501 isn't written yet, won't be until we get the final
word.  We could certainly get it finished in time for the US airing in
422's spot, and as for getting it done in the UK, assuming a mid-July
start for season 4, means you'd run episodes through late October/early
November so again you're okay.
                                                                  jms
