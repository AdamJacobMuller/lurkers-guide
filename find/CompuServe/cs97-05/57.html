<pre> Rebecca Eschliman &lt;76072.2345@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Do you know if this "view-it-and-weep (or throw something --
&gt; viewer's choice)" ep is among the currently batch or is among the
&gt; final four being held over until next October?

      I've forgotten which we were discussing....

                                                                  jms
