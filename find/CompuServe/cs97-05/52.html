      Actually, one episode coming up in this batch is, according to
John Copeland, the single most subversive thing we've ever done on the
show.  It's a *mean* episode and completely, unabashedly underhanded in
its way of illuminating certain things.  While, oddly enough, ending in
a positive fashion, despite George Johnsen's comment at playback during
the audio mix, "Okay, what sadistic m-----f----- wrote this thing?"

                                                                  jms
