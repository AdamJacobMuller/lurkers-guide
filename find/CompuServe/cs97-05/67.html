<pre> T.P. Chai &lt;104674.3064@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; JMS, 1) was Delenn in secret communication with Neroon on Minbar?
&gt; or was it all worked out in advance?
&gt; 2) were the instructions for Lennier meant to be carried out if
&gt; she dies in the starfire pit?

      They were worked out in advance, and yes, the instructions were
for posthumous use.

                                                                  jms
