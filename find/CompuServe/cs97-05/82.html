<pre> SysOp Dupa T Parrot &lt;70040.104@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is "Rebo and Zooty" a tip o' the hat to anyone in particular?
&gt; Or are they merely inspired fictional characters?

      No, not intended as tributes to anyone, just a cool sounding
pair of names (but also annoying sounding).

                                                                  jms
