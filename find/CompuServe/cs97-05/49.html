<h3>Date: 15 May 1997 21:22:04 -0700</h3>
<pre> Tom Knudsen &lt;72347.1626@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Could you possibly give us a feel as you what you think the odds
&gt; are of the sequel happening, or do you not want to jinx it by
&gt; doing so?

      My opinion on the fate of that and S5 changes on a daily,
sometimes an hourly basis...best to say when I know more for sure.

                                                                  jms
