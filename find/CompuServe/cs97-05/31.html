      Funny thing...was returning from Marcon and on the plane was me,
Tracy Torme (Sliders) and Bryce Zabel (Dark Skies).  I noted as we took
off that if the plane went down, the SFTV universe would be ceded to
Piller and Carter by default.

                                                                  jms
