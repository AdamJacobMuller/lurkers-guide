<pre> Douglas Piligian &lt;70760.2440@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Any chance of getting WB to change back?
&gt; Do you have any say in this?
&gt; Perhaps Zathrus could be called in for technical support?

      Alas, I have no say in this, despite having tried to have a say
in it.

                                                                  jms
