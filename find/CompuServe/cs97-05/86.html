      What I love -- knowing that our EFX guys are now doing the EFX
for Voyager and to some extent DS9 -- is seeing a ST fan's letter in
the current SF Universe saying how much he hates B5's EFX and prefers
Voyager's because we use CGI which looks faker than ST's EFX...which
are, in fact, being done in large measure in EXACTLY the same way, with
the SAME EFX that we pioneered, by the SAME PEOPLE.

      You just want to go up to him and plink him in the nose...just
one finger, just a plink, that's all....

                                                                  jms
