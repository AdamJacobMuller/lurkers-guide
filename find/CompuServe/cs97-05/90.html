<pre> Meryl Yourish &lt;103470.2703@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I'm about to mourn the loss of the (sigh) greatest baritone voice
&gt; we have on B5, but I have a question for you: Does the loss of
&gt; Neroon indicate we may be seeing John Vickery return in his
&gt; Nightwatch role?

      No, not as that role, but we're definitely open to using him in
other roles, as with Wayne Alexander.

                                                                  jms
