<pre> Eric Baker &lt;76600.2605@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; So, is there a link?
&gt; Are comics readers predisposed towards TV writing, or is it just
&gt; another one of those causal fallacies?

       I think that comics fans grow into SF fans, and from SF fans
come SF writers and (now) SF producers.  Genre domino theory.

                                                                  jms
