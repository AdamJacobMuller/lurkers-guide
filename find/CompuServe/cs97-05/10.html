<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; What do you mean exactly?
&gt; Do you mean the new incarnation(post gritty Griffen version 4),
&gt; or something more recent?

      I think that the thing has gone downhill ever since they redid
them a few years ago.  They've kind of gone back to the roots of the
book, but now it seems to be getting a bit silly, and the names of the
characters have gotten changed, and it's gotten dopey.

      Ah, well...for me, Superman died with the Alan Moore two-parter
(now on sale as a graphic novel, "Whatever Happened to the Man of
Tomorrow?")  That, for my money, was the best thing DC did with the
character in decades.  I don't know who the new guy is....

                                                                  jms
