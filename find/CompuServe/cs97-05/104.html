<pre> Martin Toggweiler &lt;74041.2400@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Why couldn't Lyta's lie-detecting abilities be used to oversee
&gt; the negotiations between the station command and the smugglers
&gt; who are bringing in suppiles? Why should they care that Lyta
&gt; doesn't have the stamp of approval of an Earth organization that
&gt; was in cahoots with the Shadows? Or are there plentiful telepaths
&gt; of their own races available for hire on B5? Could Neroon have
&gt; walked out after saving Delenn? Was there something about the
&gt; Wheel that prevented the last person from exiting? If not, why did
&gt; Neroon feel that HE must die after having the revelation that his
&gt; heart is religious? Guilt over not seeing the "truth" sooner?

      Because telepaths only function in very limited ways due to
privacy laws.  You couldn't just use them broad-based as lie detectors
in the way you suggest, because it first requires getting the
*permission* of those involved, and you can be reasonably sure that
smugglers aren't going to want people poking around in their heads;
second, there was a large group there, and a midrange teep can usually
handle only one or at most two people with any degree of accuracy; it
goes down dramatically after that.

      I specifically set up rules for telepaths to avoid letting them
become the deus ex machina, the easy solution to any problem.

                                                                  jms
