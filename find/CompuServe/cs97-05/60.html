<H2>production schedule?</H2>
<h3>Date: 19 May 1997 14:29:23 -0700</h3>
<pre> Hugh Kennedy &lt;70042.710@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Do you film episodes as they appear to us, that is a discrete
&gt; entity or do you try to combine things so the filming and SFX for
&gt; several episodes are combined?

       Every once in a great while we'll nail a scene for one episode
while we're shooting another, by bringing in the director for that
episode for just half a day or so, but generally we tend to avoid it
because it creates complications with the guilds, and it takes a while
to get the waivers.

                                                                  jms
