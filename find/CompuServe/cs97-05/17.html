       Re: Lise...well, everybody can't be a fighter; we've had guys
and the occasional female character who isn't used to being shot at.  I
daresay I'm not terribly used to being shot at, and someone who's
mainly a civilian would probably react about that same way.  It's just
a matter of showing that diversity realistically rather than saying,
"Okay, let's have a helpless female now."  Having every female (or
male) hard-nosed and laughing off PPG bursts is as unrealistic as its
opposite.

                                                                  jms
