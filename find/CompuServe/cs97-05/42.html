       Stop sending this to me.

       Let me be clear: I have received letters on this situation from
just about every side, each con accusing the other of being somehow
inferior, or screwed up, and each asking me to "take sides" in this.

       I do not know the German situation enough to comment any
further. And I will not, let me repeat that, WILL NOT be pulled into
fan feuds or convention disagreements, unless I happen to have
*personal* experience with the situation.  I do not.

       This is the last reply I will make on this.

                                                                  jms
