<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Could you please elaborate a little for me?
&gt; Since I want to read a little more science fiction, could you
&gt; reccommend something of Harlan's that you think I might enjoy?

      Just about ANY of Harlan's books are worth reading, though
Strange Wine and Shatterday (available at most SF stores) are personal
favorites, and his latest Edgeworks volume just came out.

      Sci-Fi vs. SF...the former is flash-n-dazzle, monsters eating
people, ID4, lots of action and not much thought.  SF is Blade Runner,
the first Alien movie, The Day the Earth Stood Still, Seconds, Charley,
others. Science Fiction means it examines the impact of technology on
people, or in some way extrapolates to the future in new and
interesting or innovative ways.

                                                                  jms
