<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; How could anyone have *ever* even entertained the idea that all
&gt; the excitement was over when the Shadow War ended?

       Heck, for my money, what follows in the rest of this season is
more exciting and more intense than anything we did during the shadow
war... because it's a lot more personal.

                                                                  jms
