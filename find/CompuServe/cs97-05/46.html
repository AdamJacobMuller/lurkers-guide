<pre> Jonathan Kass &lt;74130.443@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Anyhow, quick question on the missing daughter - please don't
&gt; interpret this as criticism of the actress, but I gotta ask - was
&gt; that the person who won the walk-on last year (as I remember it,
&gt; there was a contest with Delenn where someone was going to win a
&gt; 4th season walk on, but I don't remember hearing much about who
&gt; won, or what episode they'd be seen in)??

       No, that had nothing to do with the contest.

                                                                  jms
