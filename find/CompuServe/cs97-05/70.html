<pre> Phyllis Schmulenson &lt;72447.224@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; the slightest bit interested in the content and development of
&gt; the art forms they are broadcasting -or would they be just as
&gt; happy with hours of Mickie Mouse cartoons every night if sponsers
&gt; would pay for it? Do they ever watch the shows or have any
&gt; concepts to contribute?

      They want the money from the commercials, and whatever sells
commercials is fine by them.

                                                                  jms
