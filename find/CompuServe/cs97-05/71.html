<pre> Deonaha M. Conlin &lt;102531.2627@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Speaking of which - was that the same fellow who played Dukat?
&gt; What happened to his backbone?

      Thanks, on all counts...and no, that was a different actor than
the one who played Dukhat.  Starting from this episode the intensity
builds and never lets up for the rest of the season.

                                                                  jms
