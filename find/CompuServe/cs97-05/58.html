<h3>Date: 18 May 1997 21:40:11 -0700</h3>
<pre> Rebecca Eschliman &lt;76072.2345@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; One oddball question: Are tears a normal Minbari physical
&gt; reaction, or is weeping (for Delenn) one of the changes mandated
&gt; by her chrysalitic experience?

"Are tears a normal Minbari physical reaction, or is weeping (for
Delenn) one of the changes mandated by her chrysalitic"

      We've seen Delenn cry before, when she and G'Kar were in her
quarters and she was explining why she did not get involved in the
Narn/Centauri war.

                                                                  jms
