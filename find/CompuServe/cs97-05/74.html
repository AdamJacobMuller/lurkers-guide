<pre> Jonathan Kass &lt;74130.443@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; FIRST A QUESTION I HOPE YOU CAN ANSWER - Was / Is there something
&gt; wrong with Walter Koenig? ANOTHER QUESTION - some of us
&gt; knuckleheads have been off arguing over who is / was Control -
&gt; was Control Talia? Was that established?
&gt; Or is there still another "traitor" in their midst?
&gt; Oh and did you hear / would you believe the voice-over teaser
&gt; right before the episode started in LA said "Delenn surrenders to
&gt; the Warrior Caste, and Sheridan declares war on Earth"????

       Thanks.  As for Walter...he made the decision to play Bester
with a deformed or useless hand, which he's compensating for as a teep.

                                                                  jms
