      The issue of waste of bandwith is not as big a deal to an
advanced technology (from today's standards); also, any really good
telepath could rip out those codes and keys in about 10 seconds. 
Further, they would've had a password to use (as in "the board," which
he used) to verify that he was all right and not being forced to make
the call.

                                                                  jms
