<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; How do you rate Star Wars in this?
&gt; Or the 6 million dollar man?

      Star Wars: space fantasy.  6 Million Dollar Man: began as
something close to SF, collapsed shortly thereafter into just plain
awfulness.  The idea of advanced prosthetics incorporated into a living
human is an interesting idea...but frittered away here.
