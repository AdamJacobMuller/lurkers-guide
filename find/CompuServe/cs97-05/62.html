<pre> T.P. Chai &lt;104674.3064@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Did you choose the name Bester because it sounds like B-st-ard?
&gt; My question is, were any of the members of the new Gray Council
&gt; on the old Council?

       Yeah, some of the new council would've been on the old one.

       And Bester was named for a well-known SF writer, now gone.

                                                                  jms
