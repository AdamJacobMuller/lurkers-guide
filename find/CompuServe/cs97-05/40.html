<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;75063.3305@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Was it a case of him having already been through that in his
&gt; head, or was it a case of them helping his thoughts along? Or was
&gt; it just a weird coincidence? Did I notice Ivanova's eyes flicking
&gt; back and forth like she was reading a teleprompter? But could it
&gt; be addictive? But this isn't quite the same Sheridan, is it?

      Yeah, we had Claudia use a teleprompter there to add to the
sense of having to read something...and enjoy the happy-go-lucky
Sheridan...it's the last you'll see of him for a long time....

                                                                  jms
