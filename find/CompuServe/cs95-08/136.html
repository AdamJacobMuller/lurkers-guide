<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: August 02, 1995 12:43:22 PM</h3>
<pre>&lt;  The Long,Twilight Struggle just aired in Britain yesterday and I 
loved it.  After stretching out our souls and hammering them with a 
mallet in 'Confessions and Lamentations' then delivering a steel-shod 
kick to the heart in 'Divided Loyalties', 'Long, Twilight Struggle' almost 
finished me off.&gt;

     Thanks; the reaction to "Twilight" has been terrific, and I think it 
bodes well for us in the coming year.
