<H2> BIG BANG				</H2>
<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: August 16, 1995 11:53:12 PM</h3>
<pre>     Except that Michael O'Hare has already been dragged into this.  
And Tom's latest message does it again.  On the one hand, he says Michael 
is a good man...and then, by implication, by alleging that Michael agreed 
to do the Big Bang without receiving the second $5,000, implies that Michael 
lied to and defrauded the fans at Comic Con.  That fundraiser was done 
because he did not receive the balance of his payment.  According to Tom, 
there *was* no balance of payment.  So clearly, someone here is fabricating.  
By his message, Tom is implying that Michael lied to me, and to the convention 
goers who came to his support.  Or that we both lied about it.

     We didn't.
