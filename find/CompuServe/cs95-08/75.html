<pre>     Tom:

     So good of you to emerge from seclusion to post this via Linda.  I 
wish your message touched the facts at two contiguous places, but one 
cannot have everything.  I do hope this won't be another post-and-run 
situation, because there's much to clarify here.

     So you're saying that because Michael O'Hare initially said he 
wouldn't be coming, you fined him the $5,000 remaining on his fee, and he 
agreed to this.  Aside from the loathesome mentality behind this excuse, 
please explain to me why it was that on the Sunday of Chicago Comic Con, 
Michael had been told, by you, that you would be present by 12 noon, with 
that very same $5,000 owed as his balance...and never showed up.  If he had 
agreed to this, then why was he still awaiting this payment, and why were 
you saying you would have it for him?

     Simple answer: because Michael O'Hare agreed to no such thing.  This 
is a cover story to excuse non-payment of Michael's fee.  Further, you 
told some users on this very system that Michael had been paid the balance 
of his fees, in phone conversations, even offered to send a photocoy of the 
canceled check (which of course never happened).  You really should work 
more on getting your story straight.

     We have begun documenting, in writing, some of the destructive and 
hurtfulthings you have put out on the rumor mills about Michael, myself 
and others...so your assertion that you "would never hurt" anyone doesn't 
carry much weight at this end of the modem.

     I have had a good conversation just today with Deborah Smolinski at 
Visions, and we are working closely with them on this situation.  Certainly 
they should notbe faulted for falling for rumors started by others.  The 
purpose of the convention is not, and never has been, the issue.  As for 
your statement that "I have never spoken to Bob Mcgloughlin since the Big 
Bang show in June," Deborah said about 90 minutes ago that you and he had 
spoken just recently about this situation.  Who am I to believe?

     "JMS wants CMC and myself out of the science fiction convention 
business."  No, I simply will not allow the offenses and incomeptence on 
record to stand without comment.  Even after the Planet Hollywood debacle, 
in which I sent you a several-page letter explaining what would be required 
to fix the apparent problems, there was the spirit of cooperation until such 
time as you began selling unlicensed B5 jackets, patches, and posters for a 
non-existent charitable cause that used our name.  At that time, I told you 
that Babylonian Productions was withdrawing all support from this convention, 
and I would caution my cast in this regard, though leaving them to make their 
own decisions.  Some of them went out of concerns for the fans who had 
purchased non-refundable airline tickets and would be screwed otherwise.

     And as long as you're here, some additional points.

     Mark Hamill has been stiffed by you to the tune of $21,000.  The check 
for his speaking fee has, he tells us, bounced.  Another check made out to 
cover first class airfare and accommodations has also bounced.  Why hasn't 
Mark been paid?  Why do you write checks that can't be covered?

     I have received messages from many people...the photographer you hired 
to shoot the convention, travel agents, security people...who say that they 
have not been paid by you.  Why have they not been paid?  They come to me 
because you promoted this as a B5 convention, so I have inherited the 
problems you created by default.

     Why did you have someone working on designs on the fraudulent Project 
Starfury months after you had been told to cease and desist from such 
endeavors, with this individual putting in $5,000 worth of work that has 
now been wasted?

     Why were you telling people -- and we have now written documentation 
to that effect -- that I had been "tossed out of the Writers Guild" when 
such is not true?

     Many users here and on other systems have repeatedly asked you for 
refunds on their tickets.  Why has this not been forthcoming?

     In your newsletters, and your talks, including your May 28th meeting 
with fans in Schaumburg, IL, you stated that one of the major features of 
the convention would be the transformation of the Odeum theater into 
"Outpost Odeum," with massive role-playing aspects, props, and a scripted 
game which would include appearances by paid actors performing with the 
"Outpost Odeum" game.  Many went for this reason.  Yet no such event 
was presented.  You promised, in detail, a Sandman reenactment from Logan's 
Run; what happened to *that*?

     Would you care to comment on the assault on a dealer by staff, when he 
attempted to document poor conditions in the dealer's room, which led to 
hospitalization and surgery for severe injury to his eye?

     An individual began selling video tapes of our actors appearances at 
Big Bang.  He was told, by you, that you had contractual freedom to make and 
distribute these tapes, when, in fact, the contracts stated clearly that 
no such video or audio sales of the performance could be done unless a 
seperate agreement were entered into and signed by the actors.  Why 
was this person misled?

     For months now, many people here and on the other nets have been 
posting their dissatisfaction that what was promised by Big Bang was not 
delievered upon.  Since you clearly have access to the nets, as shown by 
your posting, why have you not previously addressed the concerns raised by 
so many people who attended your convention?

     Finally, let me repeat once more: my concern, ever since the Planet 
Hollywood event, was that the Big Bang convention was being poorly and 
incompetently run, and would hurt fans, and I wondered at the capacity of 
CMC to deliver on its promises.  The reactions from virtually every person
attending the convention bears out my concerns.  Cast members returned saying 
uniformly that it was the worst-run convention they had ever seen, and some 
had been attending conventions for over 20 years.  It was a disaster, and has 
left a pile of debris that you have yet to clean up, and which comes to 
*my* attention because they can't find *you*...with phone numbers that get 
disconnected, calls that don't get returned...and always you try and 
blame others.

     Everything I have said about BB has come true; your statements, 
however, are another question altogether.

                                                                 jms
