<pre>&lt;One thing I wondered about - when Lanz made that little speech about 
'peace in our time' I sat bolt upright, because it sounded akin to 
what Chamberlain said when he got back from Munich in 1938, having 
just signed a non-aggression treaty with Germany.&gt;

     Yes, it was a definite nod to Chamberlain, and a bit of foreshadowing 
for ominous things to come.
