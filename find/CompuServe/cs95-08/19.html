<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: August 06, 1995 12:52:17 AM</h3>
<pre>     Let me address the small points first, then go into the major 
thesis.

     What keeps B5 from becoming a "cult" series if it runs only its 
five years?  I dunno...lots of shows run only 5 years or less.  The 
majority of them, in fact.  I'd also point out that in the moderately-
hard SF area -- space stuff, star travel and the like -- no show has EVER 
gone five years except Star Trek.  Even Lost in Space went only 3 years 
(September 1965 to September 1968).  Prior to the new incarnations of ST, 
the original series ALSO didn't make it past 3 years.

     So if you really *want* to look at the only non-Star Trek spacefaring 
SF series to go (hopefully) five years in, oh, the entire HISTORY of 
American television and minimize that by calling it a "cult" series, well, 
that's certainly your right.  I don't agree with it, but one wouldn't expect 
me to.

     Twin Peaks, which only went about 2, max 3 seasons, is a short enough 
run to be justifiably called a "cult" show.  Five seasons is a credible 
series in *anyone's* book.  Right now, at just shy of year two, we're still 
a cult series.  By year five we would not be; we'd be in the same ranks as 
any successful TV series, and success is defined as 90-100 episodes in the 
can, enough to syndicate thereafter.  So right from the git-go, the term 
being used, "cult series," doesn't apply, I think.  It's no more a cult 
series than any mainstream series that goes 5 seasons.  (Hill Street Blues 
just *barely* made it to six years.)

     Blake's 7 is a UK series, and to American audiences, that usually 
becomes "cult" by definition.  And, again, B7 ran only 4 years, from January 
1978 - December 1981.  Dr. Who, though gifted with a 20+ year run, is also not 
much known in the US, and thus comes under a "cult" show heading by that 
default.  (Because part of the definition of cult show is not a numerical 
issue, as you seem to advance, but a philosophical issue, the extent to which 
the society at large knows about the show, or elements of that show.)

     But to continue using your terminology for a moment...Space 1999, which 
you cite, ran only from 1975-1977, three years again, which once more does 
not allow for any real momentum to be built up in making the general populace 
aware of it.  Quantum Leap made 5 years, but since we're talking space-SF at 
the moment, and it'sreally more of an anthology series with recurring 
characters, that goes into a separate category for now.

     If this show goes the full five years -- and it will -- it will become 
the only non-Star Trek space series to do so in the history of American TV. 
That is a *huge* accomplishment.  Will it become widely known and accepted by 
the American consciousness, mainstreamed like ST, so that Jay Leno can comment 
on Klingons and everybody in the audience knows what he's talking about?  
Who knows?  Maybe, maybe not.  Doesn't really matter to me one way or another.  
The show will be there.  A painting is no less a 
painting for the number of people who pass in front of it.  It is what it is.

     I could probably help matters a bit by going more for merchandising, put 
in some scantily-clad women, doing a lot of stunts...but I've said from the 
start, I'm not here to try and make a franchise, I'm here to tell a story.  
Some folks will like it, some won't.  Them's the breaks.

     So the thesis of your panel, in some measure, seems to be, If B5 does 
not become as well known as ST, is it ultimately successful or important in 
American culture?  To me, this is inherently flawed reasoning.  ST is only the 
measure of ST, and nothing else.  I'd even argue that except for the original 
series, there really isn't any one thing called Star Trek.  There was the 3 
season show that Gene did in the late 60s; there was the first movie Gene did 
in the late 1970s; the other movies that were done by other people, like Nick 
Meyer and Harve Bennet; the TNG series that was created by Gene and David 
Gerrold; the DS9 that was created by Berman/Pillar; and the ST:V created by 
Piller, Berman and Taylor.

     They are all, in many ways, very different creations, that share only one 
thing: the brand name.  If you renamed B5, STAR TREK: BABYLON 5, the ratings 
would go up instantly, and it would become more of a household name than it is.  
It would be no different a show, but it would have that brand name behind it.

     "What keeps Trek from falling into the "cult" classification is the 
ongoing production."  Negative.  To play one side of the coin for a moment, 
the second most of the population knows or recognizes the word "Klingon," it has 
stopped being a cult show, *on a philosophical level*.  And that happened long 
before TNG ever went into production.  That happened over the 20 years the 
original three-season ST was in syndication.

     To play the other side of it...I hate to break it to you, but media SF is 
STILL considered a "cult" area, by critics, by networks, by the press, by most of 
the population.  A very small portion of viewers watch SF, including ST.  It may 
seem to you otherwise, because as SF fans we're nominally in the fishbowl, but it's 
true.  In syndication, you need far fewer ratings points to survive.  Overall, 
neither TNG nor DS9 got anywhere near decent network ratings, though there were a 
few times in TNG's history -- the pilot and a couple others -- where it approached 
that.  Put onto a network series list, they would both be where ST:V is right now...
in the cellar.

     So, overall, I think the entire thesis of the panel is flawed, and proceeds 
from the trap of accepted cliche, misinformation and fuzzy thinking that has little 
to do with the realities of TV and culture.

     Now to the main point of *my* thesis here.

     I'm frankly tired as hell of "ST vs. B5" or "ST/B5" panels, however they're 
couched.  They are separate shows, they have nothing to do with one another, 
they're as different as night and day, and the only reason to put them into the 
same panel is to start a fracas or take a philosophical position by defined 
contrariness.  And, fundamentally, it continues to put ST at the center of the 
universe.  We're going on our third season now, and things look good for seasons 
thereafter.  We've carved out our own identity. why can't we be taken or discussed 
on our own?  Why does there always have to be this nutty feud?

     Are you going to be doing ST/Quantum Leap panels?  Will there be any X-Files
/Star Trek panels?  No, because they're nothing like Star Trek, AND NEITHER ARE WE.  
Yet everywhere we go, ST follows us around like Marley's Ghost, rattling its chains 
and dominating the conversation.

     "Can Babylon 5 replace Trek as THE icon of SF?...without a continued run."
First off, THE icon to whom?  To core ST viewers?  Of course not.  To core B5 
viewers?  In many cases, it already has.  You equate numbers of episodes to 
quality of episodes.  Many SF writers have written MORE novels than Robert Heinlein...
but how many have written them BETTER?  And which is more an icon of SF?  Who is 
this person who decides what a media or print SF *ICON* is?

     The Oxford American Dictionary defines "icon" as, "a painting or mosaic of 
a sacred person, *itself* regarded as sacred."  If that's the Pointy Hat under 
discussion, I'd rather pass, all things considered.  I don't WANT this show to 
become an ICON.  I want to tell this story, about these people.  You can't sit 
there worrying if it's going to become a Huge Eternal Monster, or some revered 
icon, or anything that comes after the fact. That way lies madness.  You can 
only concentrate on telling the story, and making the program, as best you can.  If the audience finds you, and likes it, you get to stay on the air and finish 
your story; if not, you don't.  That simple.

     Nothing personal in this, btw, this isn't a flame, and I'm not annoyed,
I'm just trying to answer the question honestly.  And yes, the info you 
provided re: BB was most helpful.
