<pre>     "Joe, you do not disappoint."

     I'm trying *awful* hard not to.  Doing this show right is terribly 
important to all of us involved in it.  I really want it to be the kind 
of show I've always wanted to watch as a fan.  And I'm very, very pleased 
that the writing is generally satisfactory.  Sometimes, when 
behind the keyboard, one has grave doubts if it's good enough....
