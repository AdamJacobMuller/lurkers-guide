<pre>     No, the Sheridan arc is completely different from the Sinclair stuff. 
If it were just a continuation, then there'd be no need for the change.  
The whole REASON was to do stuff we couldn't do otherwise.

     Book 3 will be out later this month.  No plans on hardcover.  DC keeps 
saying book 11 is the last, but I've been told by WB that the deal to extend 
the comic to #24 at least has been agreed to, so I don't know what the heck 
is going on.

                                                               jms
