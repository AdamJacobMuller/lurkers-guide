<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: August 22, 1995 11:12:00 PM</h3>
<pre>	&lt;Jawa #2 demands--no I mean, DEMANDS--to know who else 
will be scriptwriting in Season 3.
	(Throw a name this way--she's vicious!)&gt;
	
     So you're saying that if I don't give you any other names, 
Jawa 2 will do terrible, mean, unspeakably rotten things to you.

     ...

    So, like, what part of this is a problem?
