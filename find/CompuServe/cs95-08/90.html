<pre>&lt;How like the early airways beacon system.  One of the features you 
can still find is that every beacon is within sight of a flyer over 
another one.  When flying was new, pilots could literally fly from 
one beacon to the next all the way accross the continent.  Were you 
consciously using this as a model?&gt;

     It's a model I considered, yes.
