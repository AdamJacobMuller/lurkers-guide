<pre>     BTW, on the subject of marketing/merchandise...I've now seen the final 
prints on the Fleer trading cards, and they're *beautiful*...also, the text 
on the cards does a nice job of synopsizing the episodes and in a way, the 
series overall, making them great and useful "cheat sheets" for those new to 
the show.
