<pre>     I tied him &lt;the main characer in CTI&gt; to a specific person because 
in writing, you *always* try to go for specifics, because generalities don't 
really work.  It's the difference, in prose, between, "The room smelled good," 
and "The room smelled of cinnamon and fresh coffee."  Also, the specific 
connotations to who and what Jack was were essential and integral to the 
storyline.
