<pre>&lt;Joe.

I've got a couple of pictures taken from the show (via a TV card), 
would there be any problems uploading them to the forum (I think I 
have to include "Copyright 1995 Warner Bros")?&gt;


     I don't know for sure, I'd say probably there's no problem, 
but the notice would have to be (c) 1995 PT&lt;E&gt;N Consortium.

                                                       jms
