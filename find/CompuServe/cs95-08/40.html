<H2> Harlan Ellison/TREK Book		</H2>
<h3>Section: Star Trek<br>Date: August 09, 1995 11:10:05 PM</h3>
<pre>     The limited edition is numbered and signed by Harlan.

     Under the terms of the Writers Guild Basic Agreement, to which all 
the major studios are signatory, the actual physical manuscript remains
the property of the writer, *not* the studio, under the Separation of 
Rights clause.  So it's 100% kosher for Harlan to reproduce the material.
