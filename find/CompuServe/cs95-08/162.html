<pre>     There are a number of metaphors in the show that operate on many 
different levels; it can't be a one-to-one corrolary to WW II, because 
that limits and makes predictable your story.

     In musical terms, it's almost a tonal piece, taking elements to 
which we respond, almost subconsciously, and then rearranging them into 
something that is, one hopes, a new construct.  You can find here echoes of 
Vietnam, of Kennedy, of Chamberlain, of WW II, of Korea, of the Mideast; 
in a way, it's a thematic piece that touches how we have come to think of 
war, and conflict, across the development of the 20th century, and the 
role of the individual in that regard.

     We have learned to think of war as something now on a huge scale, 
an entity in itself.  Once upon a time, before the gatling gun and the 
automatic rifle, combat was something individual, even in larger wars, 
one person against the enemy...and that person was honored, one person 
could turn the tide against the enemy.  In a world in which weapons of 
mass destruction exist, where then is the individual?  Where then the 
bravery, the struggle, the triumph...and the failure?  Where, 
fundamentally, is the responsibility?

     All of that is intertwined with the storyline, and to communicate that 
I'm not averse to taking elements of history that resonate with that theme 
and reworking them, knowing that on a cellular level, we *recognize* that 
aspect, we've seen it...but now in a new context, we can see it differently, 
discuss its implications, *learn* from it.

     This is one of the things I rarely talk about, because it's the kind of 
thing that is best left simply implied, or implicit, in the work, and because 
if you have to draw attention to something in the work, somehow I think it 
lessens it, because it works best unspoken.  And because I guess it sounds 
kinda presumptuous, and high-falutin' and self-indulgent.  But it's one the 
things that matters to me in the context of the story.
