<H2> Harlan Ellison/TREK Book		</H2>
<h3>Section: Star Trek<br>Date: August 12, 1995 9:47:11 PM</h3>
<pre>     CITY was only published once before, in an anthology of SF play scripts, 
something like 20 or so years ago, and has not been seen since, nor is the 
original available.

     Two things I forgot to mention: the limited edition is a numbered edition 
SIGNED by Harlan, and the longest afterword is by David Gerrold, who I 
inadvertantly left off the list of contributers.

                                                                jms
