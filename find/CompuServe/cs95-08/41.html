<pre>     Thanks, yes, Mira is a great lady, in the classic sense in which that 
word is used.

     As for the book, it puts forth a lot of documentary evidence, and the 
opinions of others outside Harlan (Nimoy, Takai, Koenig, Fontana and others) 
so it's much broader in tone than that.

                                                             jms
