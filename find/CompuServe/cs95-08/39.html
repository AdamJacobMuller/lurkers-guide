<H2> Pirate Warning from jms		</H2>
<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: August 08, 1995 7:21:25 PM</h3>
<pre>     For some time, I've been cautioning people dealing in pirated 
material; videotapes, Links, PPGs, the whole gamut.  The usual 
reaction from those involved is, basically, screw off, on the grounds 
that there's plenty of ST pirated stuff out there, and nobody does 
anything about it.  Well, for starters, that's because there's a lot 
of grey about the copyright during the period during which ST wasn't 
being produced, and the copyright wasn't being enforced.  Second...
we're not ST.  A mistake many pirates continue to make, to their 
detriment.

     To the pirates out there, be warned: Warner Bros. is prosecuting 
these cases to the full extent of the law.  Case in point: I saw 
bootleg copies of B5 episodes for sale at the Chicago ComicCon, 
confiscated them, and told the person selling them, David Scott, 
*not* to do this anymore, because if he did, we would come down on him
..hard.  His reaction was basically a shrug.

     So this same person showed up at San Diego Comic Con, selling the 
same B5 tapes.  WB was notified.  And the FBI showed up and seized the 
material. And that of the other shows he was selling.  He tried to make 
light of it at the time, nobody follows through on this stuff, after 
all.  Wrong again.  He has been prosecuted by Time Warner Entertainment,
with charges filed in United States District Court (case number 92-1602 
H POR), and there has already been a judgment rendered to the tune of 
*thousands* of dollars.

     To the pirates out there: be warned.  We're not kidding around.  We 
will take you down, hard.  Especially those selling the poor-quality 
videotapes, and those selling supposed "real props" from the series, 
which are simply cheap knockoffs with expensive price tags to separate 
fans from their money.

     (And to the OTHER dealer in Chicago, who was selling fake PPGs and 
other items, from whom I confiscated the illegal goods, and has since 
been mouthing off to other dealers that in lawfully confiscating this 
material I "shoplifted" -- and I confiscated this stuff in front of 
several witnesses, and put the dealer on notice as to what I was doing -- 
by all means, continue running your mouth; you assiduously didn't have an 
address anywhere available, and your behavior will simply make it that 
much easier for us to find you.)

     One of the reasons that I'm very careful on what we do and don't 
license is that I want them to be done *right* when they're done; as a 
fan, I've grown to despair over cheap knockoffs whose exorbitant price tags 
only feed the sharks that made them.  I won't have inferior quality products 
out there, licensed or otherwise.  We take great pains to make everything 
involved with this show of the highest quality, and will not allow anyone 
outside to hinder that effort.

                                                               jms
