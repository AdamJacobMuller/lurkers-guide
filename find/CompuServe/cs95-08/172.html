<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: August 15, 1995 3:02:06 PM</h3>
<pre>&lt;I just want to say thank-you for all the hours of enertainment that B5
has brought to my friends and I over the last couple of years - the
quality of the storylines, acting and special effects has converted us 
fromStar Trek nuts to Babylon maniacs !!&gt;

     I'm very glad to hear that, thanks.  It's a great note to go out on.

                                                               jms

</PRE>
