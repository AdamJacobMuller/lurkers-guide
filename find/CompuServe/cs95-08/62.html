<pre>     Creation Entertainment's main office is in Glendale, California, that's 
an 818 area code. They're listed in the phone book, and in directory 
information.  If you have problems with someone running a convention, you can 
contact their main office there, and speak with Adam Malin, who with his partner 
runs CE.
