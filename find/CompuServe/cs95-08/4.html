<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: August 01, 1995 11:34:07 PM</h3>
<pre>     As it happens, we've found out, a LOT of toy stores have gotten the 
B5 micromachines, but very few actually put them out on the racks, not 
knowing anything about the show (our curse continues).  In general, 
if people go into their local medium/large sized toy stores, 
and ask them to check in the back, they appear.

                                                                  jms
