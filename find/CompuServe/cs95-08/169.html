<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: August 15, 1995 2:47:17 PM</h3>
<pre>     Since "The Fall of Night" has now aired in the UK, and word is getting 
out, herewith a post I left on GEnie about Kosh's now-revealed identity.  
I thought it came out fairly well, so I'm repeating it here.

*****

      Okay.  Here it is.  I'm gonna do it.  I'm gonna reveal Kosh.

      I'm not kidding.  Bail now if you're looking in and don't want to 
know.




     No backsies.





     I mean it.




     Last chance.

     Okay, this is it.

     "If he leaves his encounter suit, he will be recognized."  
     "By who?" 
     "Everyone."

     "The First Ones taught the younger races, explored beyond the rim, 
built civilizations...."

     Kosh is what you're pointing at when you say "That's Kosh."

     "Yes, the Vorlons have been to Earth, the Vorlons have been everywhere. 
The Vorlons *are*."

     They *are*.

     "For centuries, the Vorlons have helped the younger races, guiding us, 
and --"   "And manipulating us?"  "It is, as you say, a matter...
of perspective."

     They *are*...a matter of perspective.

     Each race who sees them, sees something out of their own past, their 
own legends, religions, faiths.  A being of light, if you will, but a Drazi 
sees the Drazi version of that, Droshalla; the Minbari see the Minbari 
version of that, Valeria; humans see a human version of that.

     It is the mirror in which we see our beliefs reflected, but is it 
the progenitor of those beliefs...or an implanted image that overlays that 
vision on top of the true form of the Vorlon?  Is it revelation, or is it 
manipulation?

     The Vorlons are a cypher.  The Vorlons are a matter of perspective. 
The Vorlons are guides...or users, emissaries or puppeteers, who wish 
to be seen a certain way, so that we will react properly.

     Is this good, or is this bad?

     And the truth is, even though you have seen a Vorlon, have you seen 
THE Vorlon, the one behind the image that dances somewhere between your 
optic nerve and your brain?

     Or to quote a message I left long ago, paraphrased from memory, 
"The hand Sinclair sees is not the hand Sinclair sees, and the hand Sinclair 
sees is not the same hand someone else in the room sees, and is not even the 
hand that that person sees."

     The Vorlons Are.

                                                                 jms
