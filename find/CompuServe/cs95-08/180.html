<pre>&lt;Sebastian believed he had a destiny, so there must have been a reason 
why he thought he was superior to other people.

He threatened to stop Delenn's heart. Either he was using the frazzler, 
or the Vorlons changed him, or he could do that before the Vorlons got him.

Ironheart claimed he could do something similar, and he was part of an 
experiment to create telekinetics using drugs. Sebastian would have had 
easier access to more powerful drugs than we do now.  Ironheart also 
mentioned that most TKs were insane.

If there is a link between Psy-Corps and the shadows, and if the Psy-Corps 
are investigating telekinesis in humans, does that have have any bearing 
on why the Vorlons took Sebastian?&gt;

     Well...one out of four ain't bad.

     Thanks.
