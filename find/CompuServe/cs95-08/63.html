<pre>     Yeah, that seems to be the tendency; each time we've introduced 
someone, it's gotten hammered...nobody liked Ivanova in the beginning, 
they said she was nothing but an ice maiden...they made fun of Vir, 
said he was nothing more than comic relief, ridiculous, had no business 
being assigned to Londo...there were grave doubts about Londo and the 
hair...Sinclair got hammered in the beginning...Sheridan got hammered 
in the beginning...and each time people assumed that what the character 
seemed to be at the start was all the person would ever be.  Even when 
it was shown that other characters grew into something other, still it 
was hard for a lot of folks to assume that this new character would do 
the same, and become interesting over time.
