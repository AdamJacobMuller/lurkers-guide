<pre>     Actually, the "snitch" was the C&amp;C tech, NOT the pilot, they just 
have a somewhat similar appearance.

     We've established that klaxons go off elsewhere in the station 
during an attack to warn civilians, but they aren't going off in C&amp;C 
because they make it impossible to concentrate, as per military tradition 
(see "And Now For a Word" to confirm this).

     There wasn't time to call Draal, and they can't begin relying on him 
for every problem; they have to be able to hold their own.  You would only 
bring in Draal on something really major.

                                                                jms
