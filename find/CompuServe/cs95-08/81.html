<H2> BIG BANG				</H2>
<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: August 18, 1995 1:39:00 PM</h3>
<pre>     Thank you.  Over the years, I've worked extremely hard to develop 
a rep based on trust, and loyalty.  That this has sometimes gotten me 
into trouble goes almost without saying.  It's one of the things that 
matters most to me, because I've been in positions when I've been 
screwed, and vowed never to do it to anyone when I was on the opposite 
side of the desk.

     Here, for me, is the most telling thing.  Talk to anyone who's ever 
visited the B5 set and production office.  The one sound you hear the 
most often, in either place, is laughter, people *enjoying* their work.  
That is probably one of the things I'm most proud of.

     Whenever you hea a producer say, "Oh, we're one big family," you know 
nine times out of ten they're lying.  And, in fact, we're not like a family; 
more like a bunch of guys who get together ten months out of the year to 
have fun, make a show, play around and hang out with each other.  Everybody 
has lunch together behind the stage, whole huge groups go off on vacation 
together, after hours lots of them hang out, have dinner...we look after our 
own.  We are one of the very few studios -- and this includes the majors -- 
that provides health insurance for our employees whose premiums are 100% 
employer paid.  During the time after the big quake, we pulled carpenters 
off sets to help several people save their homes from water damage and other 
problems until real construction could be done; when the fires hit, we had 
teams ready to drive into fire zones to evacuate our DP when it looked like 
his house might go up.  We take care of our own.

     And as much as is ever possible, we try and look out for our viewers as 
well.

                                                                  jms
