<pre>&lt;Cool. Is that why Sheridan chose it, because of the Flying Tigers 
thing? If so that could tell us a little more about the character. 
So, uh, is that a screamin' eagle I see on Ivanova's helmet?&gt; 

     Yes, Sheridan chose that traditional marking.  And it's a 
traditional Russian eagle on Ivanova's helmet.
