<pre>     Yeah, Chris tends to get the lion's share of the credit for 
being online, though I've been here since 1984/85, but that's okay; 
it's the principle that matters.

     I'm glad it's helped to demystify TV, because that's been one 
of my goals from the very start.  You can't hope to influence or 
control something until you understand it.
