     That was very brave of you to admit that.  Remember, 
acknowledging your problem is the first step in dealing with it.

     I think there was a typo, though, since there was a question 
mark at the end, and it's clearly such an obviously intended direct 
statement, given our prior experience.  I figured you'd want me to 
point that out.
