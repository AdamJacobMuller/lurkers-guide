<pre>     It wasn't intended that Delenn should touch Draal; it sorta 
happened on the set, and no one really noticed, and it wasn't worth 
going back and reshooting the whole thing.  My sense is that if it's 
like a virtual reality situation, she would "feel" it even though 
it's not there, if the image was impinging correctly on the brain.

     But in either event, the image is not and should not be considered 
to be solid.

     As for Londo's shot...the director called "cut" I think a bit too 
soon, we used every frame we had to extend that shot (and, in fact, we 
even went so far as to freeze the final frame and extend the shot by a 
smidge, if you look at it carefully).  Nonetheless, I think it works 
pretty spiffily.

     As for the mass drivers, the amount of energy required to move 
something that big would generate huge amounts of heat, possibly making 
them even white-hot, hence the glow.

     Anyway, thanks for the comments; I do think it's possibly either 
the best, or one of the best shows to that point.
