<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: August 09, 1995 11:10:01 PM</h3>
<pre>&lt;Having just seen some episodes of series one again I can only say: Please, 
please, please, *more* of Vir, Lennier and Ivanova!! Bill Mumy and Claudia 
Christian in particular had much better parts, and enriched the program because 
of it, in series one.&gt;

     We have interesting things planned for all three this coming season, 
rest assured.
