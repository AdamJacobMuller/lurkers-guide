<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: August 13, 1995 6:20:03 PM</h3>
<pre>     Not going to happen.  We get a broadcast schedule from PTEN that 
tells us when new episodes/reruns will air, and we book our delivery 
schedule accordingly; this allows us maximum time to finish tweaking 
the episodes by taking advantage of the rerun periods.  The only way 
C4 can run them straight through without interruption would be to start 
running them in late February or thereabouts.
