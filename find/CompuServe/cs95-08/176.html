<pre>&lt;Keffer jettisoned his recording as soon as the Shadow ship started scanning
him. But the ISN broadcast showed the Shadow ship turning and firing,
supposedly after the recording had been jettisoned. Was the jettisoned
recording fitted with something that enabled to continue to record up to 
the point where Keffer's ship got wasted?&gt;

      Yeah, I kinda figured that recorders like this would be outfitted with a 
receiver for the ship's gun camera.  This would be vital to locate ships that
got lost, and track as long as possible what happened after the log was
ejected, and before the recorder moved out of range.

                                                                   jms
