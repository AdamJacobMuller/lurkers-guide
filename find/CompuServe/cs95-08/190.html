<pre>&lt;First, the important stuff&lt;g&gt;-Did Ann Bruice get married?  I 
noticed an additional name on her credit.

All the spoilers I read didn't make much of this exchange:

Delenn:...unless the Vorlons were prepared to stand against them.
Sheridan: Are they?
Delenn: I do not think so.

That scared the h*ll out of me.  Does this mean the Vorlons won't 
help against the shadows? If so, we're in deep trouble.

The SFX was great, including the shuttle effects.  Can't wait for 
season three.&gt;

     Yes, Anne got married.  As for the Vorlons line..."prepared" 
should be taken in the same sense as "ready"...so they may not yet be 
ready.

     Definite agreement on the shuttle sequence, works nicely.

                                                                jms
