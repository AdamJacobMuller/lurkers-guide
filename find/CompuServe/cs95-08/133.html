<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: August 01, 1995 3:56:17 PM</h3>
<pre>&lt;I know Andreas is going to get much well-deserved praise for his 
performance this week, but I'd like also to extend my appreciation 
to your CGI crew - I don't think I have _ever_ seen a space battle 
portrayed so well that I actually felt like it was real, that a 
camera had somehow managed to record the events portrayed, as the 
one between the Narn and Shadows.&gt;

     Thanks.  Yeah, that scene is one of my favorites; a lot of work 
went into it, and I think it shows.
