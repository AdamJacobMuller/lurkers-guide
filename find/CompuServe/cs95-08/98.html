<pre>&lt;I presume that if you ever show city landscapes on Earth that we 
will see old and new combined?  I mean if Europe is full of 300-500 
year old buildings that are still functional there is no reason why 
we can't assume that 20th century man can actually build something 
that will last as long. . . . for instance, the Statue of Liberty or 
the Capitol or Buckingham Palace, etc. etc.  Do you think these will 
be still be here in 4-5 centuries?&gt;

     Yes, I definitely think they'll be here still; and in some 
cases when we've shown BGs of Geneva, through windows, we've tried 
to keep that.
