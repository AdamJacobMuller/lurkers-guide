<pre>     You really do have to be totally and completely monomanaical to do this 
job if you're going to do it right.  So B5 is my life.  If I'm not writing 
or directly working on it, I'm watching dailies or thinking about where to 
take the show.  I have a pad beside my bed and frequently I wake up in the 
middle of the night with a scrap of dialogue or a plot solution, so 
I scribble it down and leave it where my feet land so I'll remember it's there.  
I don't get a hell of a lot of sleep during the week, and try to crash on 
weekends.

     To the rest you cite...there isn't time for much of anything else. I've 
seen a grand total of 1 or 2 movies at theaters in the last eight months; I 
haven't gone to a single party for longer still; except for twice weekly 
dinners with Harlan, we don't see anyone for dinner, I haven't had a chance to 
read a novel since the start of the year, I barely follow the news anymore...
it's literally a round-the-clock job.  But it's okay, because this is what 
I've been working toward since 1987.

                                                                 jms
