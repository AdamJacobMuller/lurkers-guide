<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: August 23, 1995 9:34:18 PM</h3>
<pre>&lt;I was just glancing through a couple of recent articles on B5 and 
discovered an odd sight: your name had changed. We're used to either 
J. Michael Straczynski, JMS, or Joe, but not odd combinations of the 
above. Example? Saying how "Joseph Straczynski's Babylon 5" 
may not come trippingly off the tongue.. well, they might be wright. 
Then elsewhere in the same article they use your full triple-barreled 
name: Joseph Michael Straczynski. Did someone forget to proofread 
something?&gt; 

     This is doing terrible things to my sense of identity....
