<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: August 30, 1995 1:41:29 AM</h3>
<pre>&lt;The facial resemblance between the aliens at Roswell &lt;shown in the recent
tv special&gt; and B5's Minbari was rather striking.&gt;

     Do you really think there's that much resemblance?  I don't much see it, 
myself, but this too is in the eye of the beholder.
