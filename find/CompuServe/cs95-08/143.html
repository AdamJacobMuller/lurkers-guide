<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: August 08, 1995 3:57:26 PM</h3>
<pre>     Why bring up Sebastian's past?  Because it's integral to who he is 
now, and what he's doing, and why he's doing it.  Also, there's something 
very important here about greying up the Vorlons a little; of all the people 
they could've chosen for this job, why THIS kind of person?  It makes them a 
trifle more morally ambiguous, which is necessary.

                                                                 jms
