<pre>     Agreed.  The use of different tactics and weapons at different distances 
gives a sense that there is a *strategy* behind what's going on, that it's not 
just two ships coming with city blocks of one another and clobbering each other.  
Strategy implies intelligence, and to see intelligence in the shadow vessels 
is scary indeed.....
