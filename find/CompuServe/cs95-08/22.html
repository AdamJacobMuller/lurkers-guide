<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: August 07, 1995 2:39:03 AM</h3>
<pre>&lt;I would like to further point out the following: CompuServe is a 
fair sampling of science fiction fandom hooked up electronically to 
online services, and while this branch of fandom is still a minority,
I would say it is fairly smaller but still representative cross-
section of fandom.

And on CompuServe's SF &amp; Fantasy Media Forum, Babylon Five has been 
the single *highest* trafficked message section since the Forum's 
inception in October 1994.  (I don't have the figures before the split 
off hand.)

Star Trek has been, for the past six months, number three.&gt;

     Well, hell, if that's the case, then I'm owed some *MAJOR* perks 
around here.  That official food taster never DID arrive, you know....

                                                                 jms
