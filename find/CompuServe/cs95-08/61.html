<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: August 14, 1995 1:40:13 AM</h3>
<pre>     They believe in a variety of afterlives; the god you worship, of the 
centauri pantheon, holds dominion over a given "heaven" or afterworld.  
If you appease the god sufficiently during life, it will accept you into 
that afterworld, in preparation for the day when all heavens are united; 
if not, you will have to be reborn and choose another until one accepts you.
