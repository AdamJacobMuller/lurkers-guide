<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: August 24, 1995 2:51:00 AM</h3>
<pre>     Joe Straczynski looks like a very small engine pulling a huge 
caboose.
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     Joseph Straczynski is too hard to say, even for me.
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     J.M. Straczynski just looks dorky and cumbersome.
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     J. Michael Straczynski, however, gives you a chance to sneak up 
on thelast name...a little squib, one letter, nice and inoffensive, 
then a longername, and then the big one.  It looks balanced on-screen.  
It's fairly easyto say.

     It's also a good "gatekeeper" of sorts; if the phone rings and it's
someone who asks for Michael, I know instantly it's nobody I know
personally.
