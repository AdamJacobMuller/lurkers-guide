<H2> the NEW sf standard		</H2>
<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: August 07, 1995 2:39:19 AM</h3>
<pre>     Understood.  No healing needed; it wasn't directed at you as much 
as the topic.

     I do understand your point; but I still don't think it's valid.  
If by cult you mean, as you say, "anyone who is a fan of something that 
is no more," not being produced, then EVERY TV series ever produced, 
that is now no longer being produced, becomes a "cult" show.  Again, that 
broadens the definition to the point where it's essentially meaningless.  
Specificity In Language Is Our Friend.

     The other point that I forgot to bring up in an already overlong reply 
was this: you ask, can B5 "become the mainstream reference to SF?"  For 
starters, it shouldn't, because then, for the mainstream SF = B5, and I don't 
think that's correct.  The whole point of the exercise is to broaden out and 
encourage MORE SF on the air.  What is the mainstream reference for cop shows?  
Is it CANNON?  HILL ST. BLUES?  NYPD BLUE?  DRAGNET?  There are so many of them, 
there isn't one clear point of reference.  That is the goal with SF, to get 
people to understand that there isn't any one thing that is a reference point 
to SF.

     What would it be in literature?  Heinlein?  Asimov?  Clark?  Ellison? 
Ashton-Smith?  Russell?  Simak?  Bradbury?  Anybody who says that Writer X is 
THE reference point in SF would be laughed out of the room.  The only reason 
that ST has kind of "been" that by default is that there hasn't been much 
ELSE in 30 years that's been even moderately successful.  Once that changes, 
you'll get to the *proper* definition of SF, as advanced by (I believe)
Asimov, who said, "SF is whatever I point to when I say, 'That's SF.'"

     (Which, by the way, is one of Paramount's greatest fears.  Until now, 
they've had a lock on the genre, and ST has thus been special, and they're 
worried that if there are lots of space genre shows around, that ST won't
be *special* anymore, and will have to compete on its own merits.)

     The other thing to consider in all this is the cultural aspect.  Will 
there ever be another Beatles?  No.  Because as well as their artistic 
contributions, the Beatles occupy a very special place in music history; 
they were nominally the first really big breakthrough for what we now 
consider modern rock.  They were the biggest.  They changed the field of
rock forever, redefined it, gave it tools that did not exist before, gave 
it a measure of legitimacy it did not have before.  Many other bands since 
have sold more records, but none will ever occupy that primary, pivotal 
position in our culture.  There cannot be another Beatles, and you cannot 
define another group in that light, despite every six months somebody
coming out and saying that X is "the new Beatles."

     Ditto Star Trek.  It is very much a product of its time, and it fills 
that same kind of pivotal role in SF television.  It changed SF TV back in 
the 1960s, no mistake.  It occupies a unique niche in American television 
that cannot be replicated.  Which is why I've always run from reporters who 
ask if this is the next Star Trek, if I'm "the next Roddenberry," and the
like, because there can't be either, any more than somebody is the next 
Beatles.

     The fundamental problem is that after ST went off the air, nobody
picked up the ball they'd created and ran with it.  They chipped at the 
stereotype of SF, and broke some of it, but nobody followed through with
another show.  DRAGNET changed forever cop shows; prior to then, they were 
always considered low-ratings shows, of interest only to those who like 
police procedurals.  For all its stiffness, DRAGNET showedcops with real 
lives, drinking problems, debts, marriages, dinners, dating...and in 
very short order, other shows followed suit.  Had that not happened, cop 
shows that came 20 years later would've been compared with Dragnet, since 
that would be the only reference point.  But it *did* happen with Dragnet
..and it *didn't* happen with Star Trek.

     The larger the possibilities, the less likely ANYthing is to be a
"reference point."  And that, to me, is the goal.

                                                                    jms
