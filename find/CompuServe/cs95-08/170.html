<pre>&lt;My impression of Kosh was one of relative weakness. I increasingly get the 
feeling that Kosh is indecisive and weak. Kosh allowed himself to be poisoned 
by a Minbari and, we assume, be attacked by Morden. He needed Sebastian to 
determine the motives of Delenn and Sheridan and a Vicar to probe Talia, and
here he needed Delenn to convince him to take action. He seems to use everyone
else but seldom does anything himself. Here he demonstrated the ability to fly
and somehow misdirect those watching. There might have been several ways a 
metaphysically-enlightened being could have resolved the situation without 
revealing himself. I assume that, for example Ironheart, could have done 
something with a simple thought.

I suppose I do find Kosh slighty "rightous" for my taste.&gt;

     Thanks.  And finding Kosh slightly righteous is pretty much the desired 
intent.  So you're clicking on all the right cylinders.
