<H2> Pirate Warning from jms		</H2>
<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: August 09, 1995 11:09:22 PM</h3>
<pre>     There were no negotiations.  He showed me a prototype jacket (little
did I know there were a whole bunch already made up, though he told me 
there were only two), and an associate of his showed me a prototype PPG, 
again saying no others were out there.  I said they were promising, but they 
would first have to contact WB and make a deal before anything could be done 
or said.  They never did...and began selling the jackets anyway.

     And I've now seen the exact same PPGs now at various conventions, and 
we're in the process of tracking them down.

                                                              jms
