<pre>     Look for Jerry Doyle on the Mike and Maty Show on ABC on Wednesday, 
and on Entertainment Tonight on Friday.

     Articles forthcoming in Cinescape (out now), and Cinefantastique 
(first a regular sized one, then a cover story).

     And for those who've asked...one of my better Murder She Wrote 
episodes, "The Committee," airs Thursday on USA.
