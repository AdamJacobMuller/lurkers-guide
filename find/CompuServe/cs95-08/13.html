<pre>     Because it gives you at least a shot, if the show is a huge 
success, of eventually going in and having the right to examine 
their books and at some far distant point, if you're willing 
to throw away your career but there's some serious money to be 
had, of going after them.  (Did you know that the majority of actors 
from the original ST, outside the so-called Big Three, have over 
30 years received only about $16,000 from ST in merchandise, profit, and 
other areas?)

     I believe it was Fess Parker who finally sued over profits 
from his series, which after 25 years of syndication, was still 
supposedly "in the red."  It took several years of litigation to 
get the money he was owed from his "net."
