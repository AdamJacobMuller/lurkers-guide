<pre>     Yes, the camera was still mounted on the Starfury, but cameras even 
today are constantly transmitting to other locations; TV cameras don't 
just transmit on a cable to the box they're attached to, they are uplinked 
to other places.  Similarly, the recording device continued to receive 
transmission fro the Starfury until such time as it either went out of 
range or, in this case, the transmitter was destroyed.
