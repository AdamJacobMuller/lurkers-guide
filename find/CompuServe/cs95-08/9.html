<pre>     You always have to be careful when a studio says it hasn't turned 
a profit on the show.  They say this for the primary reason that certain 
people involved with series and movies -- stars, creators, executive 
producers -- get a percentage of the net profit.  Conseuqently, it 
is studio and network policy to make absolutely sure that, whatever the 
real facts might be, none of their products *ever* show a profit *on paper*.  
You always charge something more against the income, and make sure you zero 
out the profits to avoid sharing it with anybody else.

     It's the oldest gag in the book, and in any public statement, that's 
the party line.

                                                                jms
