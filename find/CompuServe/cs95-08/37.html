<pre>&lt;I know this is a rather shallow question, but after watching "In the 
Shadow of Za'ha'dum" again this past weekend, I was wondering how many times 
(i.e. 'takes') Andrea got to smack Bruce in the Medlab scene?&gt;

     Only twice.  Mainly 'cause she tended to whack him real hard.

                                                                 jms
