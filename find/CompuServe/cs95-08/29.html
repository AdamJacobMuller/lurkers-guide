<H2> B5 CD in LA			</H2>
<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: August 07, 1995 2:46:27 AM</h3>
<pre>     BTW, for those here in the Valley in LA, the Tower Records store on 
Ventura near Van Nuys has about 10 of the B5 soundtrack CDs just sitting 
there in the rack, waiting for pickup by those who've been looking for them.

                                                                       jms
