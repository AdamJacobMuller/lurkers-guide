<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: August 18, 1995 7:14:17 PM</h3>
<pre>&lt;Back when you were over here for the Babcom '95 con, you showed us a 
tape including some goodies from forthcoming episodes. The only one 
which we haven't seen in the Last Four [tm] appeared to show Vir falling 
from a great height, which caused considerable anguish and discussion 
amongst Vir-fans.&gt;

     That was from a scene we cut from an episode.
