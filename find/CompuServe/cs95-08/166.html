<pre>&lt;&gt;Kosh is what you see when you look at him.

Does that mean that Kosh would appear different to a Hindu, a Buddist 
and the  members of all the other human religous belief systems?

Will there ever be widescreen videos of B5, and, if not, 
when are the laserdiscs due to be released.&gt;

     Yes, there would be some amount of variation among humans, though not 
in terms of beliefs that may have come along post-Vorlon influence.  This 
sort of thing has been implanted almost at a genetic level, and they do 
have a hand, or a mind, in activating it when seen.  The more people who see 
them in different ways, the longer they must maintain that, the greater the 
strain on them.

     And someday, some happy, distant day, we do hope to have widescreen 
laser disks, but that day is not yet in sight.
