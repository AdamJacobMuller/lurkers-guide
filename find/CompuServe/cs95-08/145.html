<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: August 09, 1995 12:57:08 PM</h3>
<pre>	&lt;Well, you could always say the West End fell into the ocean 
and what used to be the East End is now the West End.&lt;G&gt;

      Or one could say it's West of Babylon 5.&gt;

      No, no, it's hopeless...I'll have to turn in my writer's card.
