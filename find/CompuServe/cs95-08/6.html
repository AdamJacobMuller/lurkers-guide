<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: August 02, 1995 12:44:05 PM</h3>
<pre>     We've done a couple of steady-cam/CGI composite shots, but not 
that much; in "And Now For a Word," you'll sometimes see a floating
recorder in C&amp;C moving around...that was a steady-cam in use, and we 
composited in the CGI.  It is, however, time-consuming, so we only do 
that sort of thing as required.
