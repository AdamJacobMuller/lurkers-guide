<H2> Janeway in Murder.....		</H2>
<h3>Section: Star Trek<br>Date: August 22, 1995 3:05:27 PM</h3>
<pre>&lt;Did anyone else see a recently-aired episode of Murder, She 
Wrote in which Kate Capshaw starred?

She played the role of a wife to a rich old man who is murdered.  
I did not watch the whole episode, but she did have incredibly 
long hair.  Her character was very scared....she was 
always hanging onto Angela Lansbury (a.k.a Jessica Fletcher) 
and crying.

Quite a difference from the stern Janeway that we know.&gt;

     To show what a small world it is, check out the names of 
producers on that episode.
