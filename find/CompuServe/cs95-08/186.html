<pre>&lt;&gt;&gt; Control was the construct.  The alternate personality was dormant at 
the time Ironheart was there.

I have been thinking about this. It seems to me that one would not just 
*construct* a personality, you would have to have a starting point. 
Was the new personality formed from Talia to begin with? Is the new 
personalities name Isabella?&gt;

     I'd rather let this aspect slide for the moment.

                                                                  jms
