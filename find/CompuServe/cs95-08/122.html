<pre>&lt;will there ever be a book availabel (perhaps a CD) which explains 
WHAT thebackground of B5 is?

Like a description of all the Alien Races etc. Their Culutre, 
technology andso on.&gt;

     The hope is to do all that in a cd rom, which is currently being 
considered and discussed with several possible designers.

                                                              jms
