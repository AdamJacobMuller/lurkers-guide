<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: August 16, 1995 11:53:30 PM</h3>
<pre>     C4 can't repeat the show in widescreen, because it hasn't been 
delivered in that fashion, it'd require going back to the original 
wide negatives; but they are negotiating to show season 3 that way 
(Germany and France have already signed on for that).
