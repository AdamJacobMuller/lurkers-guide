<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: August 18, 1995 1:39:25 PM</h3>
<pre>&lt;I have some questions as well.  It seems that Ironheart should have 
picked up on the hidden personality inside Talia's psyche.

 It seems that Talia was basicly a good person.  Which of her personalities 
was the construct, Talia or Control?&gt;

     Control was the construct.  The alternate personality was dormant at the 
time Ironheart was there.

                                                                jms
