<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: August 01, 1995 12:42:08 PM</h3>
<pre>     There is a growing diversification in the names and personnel 
to whom letters are being sent via the B5 mail drop (which is not 
the main studio address).  Consequently, it is important to be 
absolutely sure to include the words C/O BABYLON 5 on any mail you 
send cast or crew at this address: 14431 Ventura Boulevard, Suite 260,
Sherman Oaks, CA 91423.  Otherwise it may end up being returned.
