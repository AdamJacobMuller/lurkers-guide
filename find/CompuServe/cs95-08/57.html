<pre>     It would be difficult, but do-able.  It would've run like this:
I hire a writer/producer as show runner on the every day aspects of 
running the series; all scripts go through me after he's done his work 
on them for any final thoughts from me (outlines also); the show runner 
handles casting of guest stars, but I'd be involved in the casting of 
regular/recurring cast. We'd work together where time allowed.  But for 
the moment, it's a moot issue in any event.

                                                             jms
