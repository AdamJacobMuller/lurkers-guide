<H2> Pirate Warning from jms		</H2>

<pre>     Depends on how you define knockoffs.  If she walked into a store and 
found xeroxed copies of her book for sale, that's absolute, blatant copyright 
infringement, and can be confiscated.  This is a similar situation.  But you 
don't just "fill your bag with the offending items and depart."  You go 
directly to the person running it, show them the item, and tell them exactly 
what you are doing, why you are doing it, what law they have broken, and that 
you are confiscating this illegal material.

     If they make a fuss over it, then what you do is to go find the nearest 
security person or police officer, put them into contact with the WB Legal 
Affairs office, and they will fax a note authorizing the police to not only 
confiscate the material, but to seize any *related* material, AND to press both 
civil and criminal charges against the person.  If that means bringing the 
FBI in, so be it.  They have a whole division specifically to protect tv and 
film product against copyright infringement, particularly video pirates.

     So it's in the best interests of the person at the dealer's table to 
cooperate.  I'm fully authorized to do this, and they don't have a legal leg to 
stand on, and they know it.  So it's best to just warn them, and take it, and 
hope they stop.  They get one chance to do it right.  After that....

     If they choose to turn cranky, well, that's their perogative, and I won't 
carry anything out...I'll just have their butt arrested, charged, and fined.

                                                                       jms
