<pre>&lt;As regards the knife, I am sure that this was not shown on our version. 
Perhaps C4 has been using its own knife, they have done so in the past.

For some reason the British censors have a real problem with knives. Rape, 
torture, nudity, language, you name it seems to get past the censors but 
you never see anybody even accidentally cutting himself.&gt;

     You're right, btw; I was informed in another message here that they did 
snip that piece of G'Kar's action.  Suffice to say I had *no* idea, and now
that I *do* have an idea...I'm simply wog-boggled.
