<pre>&lt;BTW way Joe -- does Garabaldi have his own, personalized Starfury?  
I just wondered, since (although he hasn't gone off base often) 
the markings on it match his helmet.....after his "Daffy Duck" thing, 
all I could think of was maybe his code name was "Tony the Tiger"&gt;
 
    Yes, he does; I think it is tiger-striped, in fact.
