<pre>"By the way, your dedication and commitment to your audience is the 
coolest thing I have ever seen come from the makers of a series, 
sci-fi or otherwise. You have no idea how much we appreciate it!"

     Thanks.  I guess, really, it's just having been a fan, and still 
being a fan in many ways, I just figure fans should be treated the way 
I would've liked to have been treated by folks in TeeVee.  It's really as 
much my pleasure as anyone else's.
