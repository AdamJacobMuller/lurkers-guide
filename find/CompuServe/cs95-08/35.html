<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: August 08, 1995 12:44:05 AM</h3>
<pre>     I use a good old-fashioned standard QWERTY keyboard.  As it happens, 
one reason I'm as fast as I am (100-120 wpm) is that knowing I was going to 
become a writer, I took 3 years of typing in high school, and by the time 
I finished I was *blazing*.

                                                               jms
