<H2> Babylon 5 Party success!		</H2>
<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: August 29, 1995 3:21:29 PM</h3>
<pre>     We're talking here William Messner Loebs, right?  So I'm confused, 
then; I've seen his credit endlessly...I guess I'm having prolonged brain 
fart, because I could swear it was on Flash (but you're right on the Mark 
Waid part...senility is definitely creeping in).

     Whether or not GG is making a mess in Comics Forum is not the issue 
for me; he's *there*, and as such the forum members are vulnerable to being 
quoted out of context, without their permission, in his mean-spirited little 
rag, and I refuse to make that process any easier for him by being there.

     You should definitely have Rob Davis call Laura Hitchcock at DC, if he 
is interested; we're doing 13 more issues -- one-shots and 4-issue miniseries 
-- so there's room to play.

                                                        jms
