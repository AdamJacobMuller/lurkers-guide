<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: August 27, 1995 12:32:05 AM</h3>
<pre>&lt;I have only one burning question - that scene with Delenn and Sheridan 
in the garden, where they're discussing the gaps in her vocabulary... was 
that by any chance inspired by the long-running thread here about that 
portion of Mira's anatomy? &lt;g&gt;&gt;

     No, the scene just came out of looking to have some fun with 
language.
