<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: August 06, 1995 3:17:15 PM</h3>
<pre>     That really honks me off; here Michael comes to be the GoH at the con, 
and some folks object to having his work on B5 shown there because it isn't 
ST.  Whatta buncha meroons....

     Re: showing letterbox...no, because we have not yet gone back and re- 
telecine'd the footage back to its original aspect ratio.  We strike edit 
and master prints from the negative that are regular aspect ratio.  To 
later make the widescreen versions we'll have to strike all new prints in 
the original format.

                                                                jms
