<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: August 12, 1995 9:26:25 PM</h3>
<pre>     Well, it was understood at the start that if the other show *did* 
get going, I couldn't and wouldn't be involved with it in the same fashion 
as B5; I'd have to get a different person to be show-runner, and just keep 
an arms-length involvement with the production.
