<pre>&lt;I was right!!!
Kosh is an angelic/christian image.
It was made clear that he is an angel, but not which one, if that 
can be revealed within this show.....&gt;

     Actually, no, not really; Kosh is what you see when you look at 
him. And if a Drazi looks at him, the Drazi sees something different 
than a Minbari; yes, a being of light, BUT....

     Is that what they actually ARE, or how they have programmed us 
to react when we see them?  As Sheridan said, have we been *manipulated* 
to seeing them a certain way, seeing a certain image?  We may not be
seeing what they ARE, but what they WANT us to see.

     It goes a heck of a lot deeper than what it seems.
