<pre>&lt;_The Fall of Night_ has just finished, and all I can say is that 
this has got to be the most 'OH MY GOD' episode ever!  I don't 
know how you are going to top this one...&gt;

     Thanks.  That last sequence is the single biggest effects 
sequence done for TV, insofar as I know.  There are 34 composite 
shots in a matter of just a few minutes.  Our guys nearly went blind 
doing it, but it's cool.  The whole feel, I think, is quite nice.
