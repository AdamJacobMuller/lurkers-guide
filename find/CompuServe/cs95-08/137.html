<pre>Not really, re: stealth ships, but there is something in us all that responds 
nervously when something large and dark and menacing flies overhead, particularly 
close-up.  Maybe it's second-cousin to the instinct that makes baby ducks run 
for cover when the shadow of a hawk falls over them.  Either way, it's 
compelling, and that sense is what I wanted in that shot.
