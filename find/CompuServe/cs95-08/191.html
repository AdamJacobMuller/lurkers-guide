<pre>&lt;I just caught TLTS and I just wanted to thank you for staging a space 
battle between two opposing fleets instead of just two ships.  And for 
having the ships engage at a distance too great for them to all fit on 
the TV screen at the same time.  You have once again raised the bar on 
TV SF.&gt;

     Thanks.  One of the things I wanted to try was to find a way to stage 
long-range combat. One of the things everyone says is that even though real 
aerial combat tends to be at great distance -- and space combat would be 
conducted over thousands of kilometers, you probably wouldn't be able to even 
SEE your opponent at that range, just pick up the enemy ships on your scanners 
-- you can't do that for TV because you need to have both in frame, 
hammering each other short-range, to make it work for viewers.

     But I've always liked a challenge, so I thought I'd see if I could make 
it work.  The two sides are, as noted, thousands of kilometers apart, and take 
most of that sequences just to catch up with each other.  And frankly, I think 
it's probably one of the most dynamic battle sequences we've ever done, so you 
can expect more in the future, now that I've kind of got the hang of how to 
do this.

                                                                   jms
