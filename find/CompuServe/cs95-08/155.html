<pre>     Your analysis is *exactly* correct.

     Also, check Sebastian's reaction when he asks Delenn what if she's wrong, 
"have you ever considered that?  HAVE YOU?"

     She responds, softly, "....yes."

     Look at his face when she says this.  It rattles him.  It's not the answer 
he expected, but more important, it's not the answer he wanted, needed to hear.
He needed to hear her say that she had never had the slightest *scintilla* of
doubt, that as he had been, she was a True Believer, a fanatic, incapable of
doubt of mistake...and thus doomed to failure.  He can't even meet her gaze; he
turns, looks away, and suggests an "intermission" that is more for his benefit
than hers.

     There's an awful lot going on in this show, a great deal of it sub rosa,
under the surface, implied in gestures or hesitations or looks, some implied,
some stated outright.  He *hates* the memory of Jack; it's not his name, the
one thing that is his...remember, he is caught up with "who ARE you?" and his
answer to that is lost in the persona created by history...his true name, is
what's totally forgotten to history.
