<pre>      What happened is...basically...Joe is a moron.

      I did my research.  I called up the info on the encyclopedia, got all 
the dates right, and my eyes saw East End and for whatever stupid, idiotic 
reason, my fingers typed West instead of East, and nobody, NObody, caught it 
until now.  I'd loop it, but alas the line is on his face, and it'd look real 
stupid, and the delivery is *so* perfect as it is; if we looped it, 
we'd destroy it.

      So I content myself with the notion that it's west...of B5.

      Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go shoot myself.

                                                                  jms
