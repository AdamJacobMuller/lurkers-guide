<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Got a question for ya: Where the heck is Proxima 3?
&gt; And is it a planet?
&gt; A moon?
&gt; How long has it been an Earth colony?
&gt; What's the population?

      Thanks...those scenes really worked for me as well.

      Proxima 3 is in the Proxima Centauri system, next door to
Proxima 2, but no one goes there because the tourist season is way too
short.

                                                                  jms
