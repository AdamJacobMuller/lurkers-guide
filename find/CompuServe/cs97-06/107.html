      The schedule of new episodes is designed to accommodate sweeps
periods.

      As for the coming reruns, the theory there is to back up from
419 to the number of weeks preceding it so that the reruns ramp up to,
and run right into, 419 (first new ep back) so that folks who dived in
late will be able to catch up.

                                                                  jms
