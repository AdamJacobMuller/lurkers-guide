<pre> John M. Graham &lt;74166.3727@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; If you are going to tear down the sets, what are you going to
&gt; film Season 5 on (Suits willing)?

      By "tear down" I simply mean move off the stages so we can move
the other sets in; we don't destroy them, just fold-n-hold.

                                                                  jms
