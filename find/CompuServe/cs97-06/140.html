<pre> Tom Knudsen &lt;72347.1626@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Why is this important?

      I'll pass that along.

      On the technical nit...you're right.  Another fan brought this
up, and she couldn't believe she screwed it up, because she'd *done*
the research on this.  So she went back and checked her research, and
she'd basically transposed the two, being tired and on deadline.  She
plans to correct it in the next edition.

                                                                  jms
