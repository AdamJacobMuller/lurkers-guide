      Each narration is from that character's point of view, it's not
an auctorial intrusion.  And each is specific *to that time*.  It's not
a policy statment.  It's a means of tracking the show at various points
over the five year arc.  If it's JUST about keeping peace...then you
don't have an arc.

      The show is about change.

                                                                  jms
