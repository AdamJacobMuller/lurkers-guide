       See, Burhaan, this is what makes me nuts.

       When we have shows like "Rumors" or "Epiphanies" lots of people
post message saying, "What's wrong with the show, it was going great
and now it's slowed down."  Then we have a show like "Fire" or
"Surrender" and then lots of people start posting messages saying
"What's wrong with the show, it's going too fast."

       It's like having a driver sitting behind you in the car
alternately saying "Speed up!  Slow down!  Faster!  Slower!"

       Yes, some threads have been isolated from year 5 a bit, but all
in the accelleration has not been overmuch; year 4 would've ended at
418 in the original notes, so you're only looking at 4 episodes
difference.

       This is the latter part of the story no matter how you look at
it; so you have to start speeding things up a bit in places because
that's what the latter half of a novel is *for*.  Let's all remember
basic literature 101: introduction, rising action, complication, climax
and denouement.  It gets tenser and faster the deeper you get into it.

       Why this is striking people as unexpected is utterly beyond me.

                                                                  jms
