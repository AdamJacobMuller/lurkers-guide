<pre> Debra dwnSo &lt;104412.1664@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Do they know something I don't know?

      Your friends are all wrong.

      One episode, "Sleeping in Light," takes place 20 years down the
road. The B5 series itself is contiguous, so S5 would be in 2262.

                                                                  jms
