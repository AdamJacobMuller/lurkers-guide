      Exactly.  The banal face of evil.  You look at most of the guys
who ran Treblinka, or Bergen-Belsen, and they're largely ordinary
looking guys, who could be accountants or repair men or car salesmen. 
They're *us*...and this was designed to remind us of that.  The evil,
mustache-twirling villain is too easy, and too far from the truth of
it.

                                                                  jms
