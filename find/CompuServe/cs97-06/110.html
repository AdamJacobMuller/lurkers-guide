<pre> O. C. Alexander &lt;72623.3472@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Was this line inspired by some of the recent Neanderthal finds?
&gt; Or was this part of your orignial conception for the story?
&gt; Did Edgars really believe the Earthgov propaganda that Sheridan
&gt; was operating under the malignant influence of aliens? Is Bester
&gt; really done with Garibaldi? Was this a deliberate historical
&gt; reference? Any further developments in the works here?
&gt; By the way, I think that Marcus' plaint, "Susan!?"

Wade had a great line about the clash of homo sapiens and Neanderthals
in Carthage.  Was this line inspired by some of the recent Neanderthal
finds? Or was this part of your orignial conception for the story?

      Not recent stuff, just a general knowledge of this area.

Did Edgars really believe the Earthgov propaganda that Sheridan was
operating under the malignant influence of aliens?

      Nope.

Is Bester really done with Garibaldi?

      For the moment.

One of the captains of the Earth vessels is named Leo Frank.  Was this
a deliberate historical reference?

      Not intentionally.

Franklin and Number One seem to have cooled their relationship.   Any
further developments in the works here?

      Any more personal stuff got set aside when Franklin showed up a)
with another female, and b) she was a teep.  When #1 calms down, they
might take another shot at it.

Lastly, there is a bit of irony in the fact that the stage for
Sheridan's capture is set when he steps aboard his old ship, the
Agamemnon.  Agamemnon was the supreme commander of the Greek forces at
Troy, who survived that long war, but who was betrayed and murdered by
his wife when he returned home. He blindly and arrogantly stepped into
a trap, as Sheridan also seemed to do.

      Yeah...that's one of many reasons why I picked that
image/reference. It plays on a LOT of levels in the story.

                                                                  jms
