<pre> Kevin P. Kenney &lt;104102.352@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Might this be a thread for year 5?
&gt; Or the sequel?
&gt; Or is it not cinematographic enough (episodes of people staring
&gt; at each other), and thus scheduled to occur between the two
&gt; series (possibly to be used in a later movie)? Or should I just
&gt; wait for October? Also, is your talk scheduled yet at next month's
&gt; San Diego Comic Con yet?

      I don't introduce threads I don't plan to play out.

                                                                  jms
