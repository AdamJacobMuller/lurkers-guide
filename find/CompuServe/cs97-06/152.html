<H2>Updates from jms</H2>
<h3>Date: 27 Jun 1997 01:40:16 -0700</h3>
<pre>      A number of items, from fairly important to not at all.

      If you are anywhere in the Atlanta area, I suggest -- fairly
strongly -- that you exert every effort to be present at the B5
Presentation on Sunday afternoon (I think it's 1 or 2 p.m.) featuring
B5 producer George Johnsen. He will have the usual assortment of
bloopers, clips from the two movies now in production, and other
stuff...and the "other stuff" is something folks should be around for.

      You may possibly also want to tune in to Entertainment Tonight
tomorrow (Friday) night.

      And definitely buy a copy of the TV Guide issue that hits the
stands Monday on the West Coast, and Saturday on the East Coast.  In
fact, I suggest you buy two.

      All of this will make sense in the fullness of time.

      Also...on a wholly different note...we're continuing our updates
on the B5 Fan Club.  The new edition of the newsletter is in its final
stages, and will likely hit the printers next week.  We're going to be
releasing some new items from thestation.com, including the new set of
B5 trading cards from Fleer at a very competitive price, with another
bunch of them for sale with the box autographed by some guy named
jms...and next week we should be putting up our first in a series of
B5-special ball caps, this one the exact same cap, made by the same
people, used in "Knives": Sheridan's Agamemnon cap, which has 
a silhouette of the Aggy and its ship construction ID number below. 
It's *very* spiffy.  More caps will be forthcoming.  (The cards are now
available via thestation.com, and the caps will be available there next
week.)

      We're also totally redesigning the membership kits for those
joining in the next few months, and are planning a massive facelift for
thestation.com as well.  We'll be announcing more improvements over the
next 4-5 weeks.

      Keep watching the skies....

                                                                  jms
