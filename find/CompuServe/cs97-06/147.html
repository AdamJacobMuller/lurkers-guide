<pre> Cherns Major &lt;75026.3723@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I thought that this was very insightful and fairly subtle social
&gt; commentary, but now I wonder: was this theme also directly
&gt; related to the "nature red in tooth and claw" philosophy we later
&gt; found espoused by a certain other, shadowy, crowd? Or, maybe, just
&gt; showing that certain ideas pop up all over? Oh, yeah: one more
&gt; question: is the character Captain Jack a reference to the Billy
&gt; Joel song of the same name? Later, after seeing _Intersections in
&gt; Real Time_: did I see, in a scene near the end involving a
&gt; gurney, a tip of the hat to a scene, also towards the end, in a
&gt; Frankenheimer film, recently released to video, that you've
&gt; mentioned admiring?

      I think those are pretty much no's across the board.

                                                                  jms
