"Speaking of cuts, I asked this question of all and sundry, but people
don't seem to know... Will B5 be released on LaserDisc or DVD ever?
Even if there are no current plans for such, what do you think of the
idea / chances?"

      I have every confidence it'll happen in the fullness of time.

                                                                  jms
