<pre> Douglas Piligian &lt;70760.2440@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; What can you tell us about the filming so far?
&gt; How has that impacted the overall production?

      Actually, we don't really have that much more money.  Each
episode costs a tick under $1 million; for purposes of discussion,
let's round that up to 1. So you're now talking 2 million for 2 hours. 
Now you've got another million to spend.  *But* ALL the prices go up by
union scale and whatever else can be negotiated.  Actors fees go up,
writers fees go up, directors fees go up, crew fees go up...so at the
end of the day, you find you have a *little* more to spend, but not
really that much.

      As for how everyone's handling it...really no different than the
series. Actors learn their lines, directors do their shots, the
atmosphere on set really isn't much different.  The only substantive
difference is that, because we know we won't be airing these until
January and March/April, at soonest, we have more time in post and can
therefore do more EFX.

      George calculated that there are as many EFX in "Thirdspace" as
in the entire first season of B5.

                                                                  jms
