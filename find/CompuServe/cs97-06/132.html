<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Why was this episode titled "Intersections in Real Time"?

      Each act took place in real time, no time jumps...the
conversation happened as it happened.  Since you had act breaks in
between them, those became intersections...in real time.

                                                                  jms
