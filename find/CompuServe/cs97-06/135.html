<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Has B5 been renewed for a fifth season?
&gt; And why do I see people on B5 wearing glasses and using paper and
&gt; pen? What ever happen to corrective (lens) surgery and a paperless
&gt; society?

      Nothing has been decided yet, formally, on season 5.  As for
wearing glasses in the future...not everybody's going to want to get
corrective eye surgery.  I could get it right now...but I don't let
*anybody* touch my eyes for any reason, it's probably the one phobia I
have.  (Every year when my optometrist has to do the standard glaucoma
test, requiring touching my eye with a blue dot thingie, he dreads it,
because he knows one of us is going to go through the wall...probably
him.)  As for a paperless society...every time somebody says we're
coming into a paperless society, as Ivanova once said, I get 10 more
forms to fill out.

                                                                  jms
