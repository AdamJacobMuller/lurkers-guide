<pre> T.P. Chai &lt;104674.3064@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Was that your intention?
&gt; Also, what's to stop Clarke asking Psi Corp to alter Sheridan's
&gt; mind, somehow reprogramme him, to confess?

      Because they don't want him reprogrammed; as William says,
another teep could see that he'd been altered.  They want him
*sincerely broken*.  Not just rewired.

      And yeah, I wanted this to function almost as a play in
structure.  In fact, when we shot it, we did it in full-act chunks. 
The actors would come in in the morning, rehearse it as they would a
play, then we'd shoot it the way we'd shoot a play, straight through.

                                                                  jms
