How far along are you into filming "Thirdspace"?

      Day 12.

Will it continue throughout the month of June?

      Another couple of days.

And when will filming of "In the Beginning" start.

      The very next day, wrapping on June 30th.

And approximately when will these movies air on TNT?

      January 1998 for the prequel, the second movie either 18 or 36
weeks thereafter.

One more question...Will these movies chronicle the path of all the
characters(past &amp; present)to B5?

      Two hours ain't enough time to fit them all in.

                                                                  jms
