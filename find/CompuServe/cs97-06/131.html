      Thanks...our cast invariably comes in knowing full scenes, and
can hit them without breaking or blowing a line.  So we have a tendency
at times to just let the master play out, keeping the intensity, which
can sometimes be broken by too much cross-editing.  (Note that the
Zathras/Ivanova scene a few episodes back is *entirely* one shot, four
minutes.)

                                                                  jms
