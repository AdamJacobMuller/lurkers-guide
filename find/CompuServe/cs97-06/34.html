<H2>'Drop Dead' Date?</H2>
<h3>Date: 05 Jun 1997 23:26:13 -0700</h3>
<pre> Kevin P. Kenney &lt;104102.352@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Now that we're close to it, what's the last day that the renewal
&gt; news must get to you by, to continue the actors' options? Is it
&gt; after the two movies wrap?

      Because Warners is working on several options to keep the show
on the air in the absence of PTEN, and a crowded syndication market,
they've asked for, and received, a 30 day extension on the drop dead
day from the cast.  So now they have until July 15th to make it work.

                                                                  jms
