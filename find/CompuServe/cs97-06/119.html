<H2>Cliffhangers -- Why?</H2>
<h3>Date: 19 Jun 1997 21:21:33 -0700</h3>
<pre> Rebecca Eschliman &lt;76072.2345@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; So what is the payoff for the author?
&gt; What benefit outweighs the breaking of the
&gt; storytelling/storyviewing dynamic?

      It's basically a means to get the audience, which has been away
for a long time, to come back to resolve a hanging point and jump-start
them into the episodes.  If it ends cleanly, apparently a lot of folks
in any series will just forget to tune in the following season.

                                                                  jms
