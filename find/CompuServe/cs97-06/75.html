<pre> Tom Knudsen &lt;72347.1626@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; The letter that Sinclair/Valen sent to Delenn from the
&gt; past......did she get it just before the events of WWE, or did
&gt; she have it for some time before that?

      No, she got the letter at the time of WWE.  Remember, though,
that she was at the Battle of the Line when Sinclair was scanned and
found to contain a Minbari soul...so that would be the basic start of
it.

                                                                  jms
