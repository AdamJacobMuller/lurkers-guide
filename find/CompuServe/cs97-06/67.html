      As a writer, the influences would really tend to be early ones,
so I'd cite Eric Frank Russell, HP Lovecraft, Bradbury, Ellison,
Tolkein, Clarke and "Doc" Smith as being at the top of the roster.  In
terms of television, it'd be Serling, Matheson, Corwin, again Bradbury
and Ellison, and Charles Beaumont.

                                                                  jms
