<pre> Tom Knudsen &lt;72347.1626@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Just how far back DID Delenn know that Jeff Sinclair was Valen??

       You'll find out in the TV movie.

       And there's some measure of difference between what she *knew*
and what she *suspected*.

                                                                  jms
