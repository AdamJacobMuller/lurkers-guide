      Yeah, the Londo/G'Kar stuff was nifty...and yes, he's struggling
toward redemption as best he can, making a real effort, which is
important, because if he's going to end up with a Keeper on him
eventually, as we've seen, best to feel for him, which you can't if
he's a bad guy.

      Set 'em up, knock 'em down....
