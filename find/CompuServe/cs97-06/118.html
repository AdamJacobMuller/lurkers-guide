<pre> T.P. Chai &lt;104674.3064@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Joe, now that it's been established in the novel that Vorlons
&gt; have names, is it correct to say that Kosh 2 actually have
&gt; another name but he wouldn't let people know? also, is the other
&gt; Vorlon on Minbar the same one that was in WWE?

      Yes, he had another name or designation (Naranek is actually a
title, not a name, hence why they both had it) and was primarily being
a pain in the butt.

                                                                  jms
