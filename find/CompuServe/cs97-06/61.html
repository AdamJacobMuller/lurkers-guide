<pre> Rebecca Eschliman &lt;76072.2345@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Stephen's assurance of "You're safe; no-one's gonna hurt you," is
&gt; ironic -- who knows how further damaged they will be after what
&gt; Sheridan has planned for them?

      Thanks...again, excellent points.

      One thing on the line Wade speaks...the actor consistently got
the line wrong.  It read, "Everything is illusion, Mr. Garibaldi;
constructs of light, language, metaphor," rather than concepts.

      There is a subtle but distinct difference.  But the points you
raise obtain in any event.

                                                                  jms
