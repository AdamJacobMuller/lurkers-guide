<h3>Date: 30 Jun 1997 04:02:54 -0700</h3>
<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;75063.3305@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Do you happen to know off-hand if TNT will continue the same
&gt; pattern of new/repeat/new/repeat that WB/PTEN used? I haven't, in
&gt; the past, watched TNT enough to know, but do they follow the same
&gt; ratings sweeps practices as other networks?

      They want to show it straight through, no repeats.

                                                                  jms
