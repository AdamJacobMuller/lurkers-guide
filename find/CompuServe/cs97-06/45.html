      No, it isn't really a problem...the worst that could happen is
that the show might have to go on in January rather than November, but
that's only a small gap.  The stations haven't locked down their
January schedules yet, and there's always fallout from what goes out in
November, so there are still many possibilities.

                                                                  jms
