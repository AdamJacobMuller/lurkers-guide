<pre> T.P. Chai &lt;104674.3064@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; In the scene of William's death, the part where it begins "Where
&gt; is the shuttle craft? Please tell me again how much you were
&gt; involved with the story line; did you just say "let's do a story
&gt; with Sinclair on Minbar" and Kathryn came up with all the
&gt; threads?

      I gave Kathryn a bare-bones stucture on the Marcus thing -- the
death of his brother, his trip first to B5 and then to Minbar -- but
she took on the rest on her own.  The process was pretty much as I
describe it in the intro, asking what X meant, how A related to B, and
then her pulling all the threads together in a story that filled in all
the blanks.  The credit is entirely hers on this.  I consulted and
read, but she did all the creative work on this.

                                                                  jms
