<pre> Carl Cantarella &lt;105030.3700@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Care to give me a clue?

      It's a means of making time for them to work out the limitations
of the PTEN contract, and the new syndicated market, which has been
going through massive changes in the last year or two; basically the
market has collapsed or been driven out (depending on the market you're
in) by all the new networks and program glut.  Virtually every
syndicated show has dropped from last year to this year; the only ones
that have improved over last year are B5 (7%) and Xena (18%).  Just
about everything else has dropped bigtime.

                                                                  jms
