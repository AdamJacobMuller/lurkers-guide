<pre> Douglas Piligian &lt;70760.2440@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Do guest stars just look at roles like these as "another day in
&gt; the office"? Do the guests ever comment about that, do they even
&gt; notice any difference?

      Usually guest stars show up with "another job" in their
head...but by the time they leave we've converted 'em, and we often get
notes from them saying how great the experience was, and wanting to
come back.  Sometimes they become part of the extended family, and just
come by to hang out.

                                                                  jms
