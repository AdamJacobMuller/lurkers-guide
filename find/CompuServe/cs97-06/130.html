<pre> Shawn D. Ratner &lt;73753.175@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Also, at the end of the episodes will we see a preview of the
&gt; next episode like we do now? After TNT runs Bablon 5, would you
&gt; ever consider doing a Babylon 5 motion picture?

      Of all the questions, the only one I know offhand is the last
one, and yeah, I'd love to do a B5 feature, and have discussed this
with WB for down the road a piece.

                                                                  jms
