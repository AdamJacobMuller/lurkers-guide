<pre> Kristi Ferebee &lt;75361.1615@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is this where technology is heading?
&gt; Are we going to abolish animal testing only to have corporations
&gt; start doing human testing? *Is this little lab of horrors the
&gt; truth that Edgars is going to show Garibaldi when he brings
&gt; Sheridan in? Why would they have wanted him to hate telepaths?
&gt; Or is he a plant in Edgars' organization, with the PsiCorps
&gt; watching through his brain or something? *Exactly what _is_
&gt; Sheridan planning to do with the telepaths on B5? One thing:
&gt; Wouldn't Franklin be obligated to tell Lyta what she's reviving
&gt; her "comrades" for? *Whatever this top-secret telepath project of
&gt; SHeridan's is, does Delenn approve? "_Think_ _Like_ _Them_?!"
&gt; "Yes," "_No!_") Will Delenn even find out before Garibaldi takes
&gt; Sheridan to Mars? True, Clark would begin to put on the pretense
&gt; of a trial, but who's gonna stop him from hiring a loyal
&gt; brainwashed Earther to become a crazed assassin? * On the
&gt; commercial: But who's really in control? PsiCorps, Shadowfriends,
&gt; Clark, or an unknown enemy? Garibaldi?
&gt; Bester on the trailers?

       Actually, Garibaldi's said he doesn't trust telepaths ever
since the pilot movie.  It's a question of degrees at this point.

                                                                  jms
