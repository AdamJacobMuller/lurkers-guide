<pre> colin heaps &lt;100622.3610@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Now, assuming to big "IF's" - IF season 5 is a go and IF Claudia
&gt; agrees to stay for S5, will her talent be explored in any depth,
&gt; or is it just a character trait, she has it but no-one will know
&gt; to what level it goes?

      That element of her personality will come in to play eventually;
there ain't much waste on this show.

                                                                  jms
