       No, I wasn't in the military, just having missed the Vietnam
draft. The points you mention are all the ones I wanted to get into
with that episode, and the ones a lot of folks have overlooked in
suggesting that it should have been an episode about slicing-and-dicing
the enemy (the enemy in this case being our own species).  The show, at
root, is about ethics, among other things, and the ethical choices will
continue to get more difficult the deeper you go.  There is a very fine
line that Sheridan's walking in all this.

                                                                  jms
