<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; This makes me think of a question -- and I'm not trying to be
&gt; nosy here, just curious -- when you pull double-duty on an
&gt; episode, like when you write the episode as well as produce, and
&gt; in one case even direct, are you paid for each job?

      There is a script fee that one receives as a writer, and if you
are also a producer there is a separate negotiated fee.  The former is
set by the WGA, and can be improved by negotiation; the latter is
strictly a matter of negotiation.

                                                                  jms
