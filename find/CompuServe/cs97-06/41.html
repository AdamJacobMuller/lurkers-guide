<pre> T.P. Chai &lt;104674.3064@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; the B5 logo, and put it on a T shirt and wear it myself, then
&gt; it's OK, as long as don't mass produce and sell it? what about
&gt; using actual screen shots from the TV on a Tshirt?

       That sounds about right.

                                                                  jms
