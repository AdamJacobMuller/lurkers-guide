<pre> Anne Stallcup &lt;102436.203@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; And when is Ivanova going to learn to quit saying things like
&gt; "We'll be OK as long as nothing goes wrong."?

      Thanks...and I've always been a big believer in the notion that
we can purchase redemption if we are willing to go to the wall, not for
ourselves, but for someone else...so there's a chance for all of
them....

                                                                  jms
