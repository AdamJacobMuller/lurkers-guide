<pre> Bob Koslosky &lt;102365.2062@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; And Sheridan goes on to say that it's going to get harder??
&gt; What gives?

"It seems to me that the White Stars (particularly in the numbers I
perceived in this Ep)  should have been able to deal with the Earth
ships like lamb to a slaughter."

      Yeah, if all you want is to slaughter fellow humans and
officers; if you want to try to minimize the body count of your fellow
officers, who you want to eventually side with you, it's more
difficult, you have to keep the kid gloves on...which endangers you in
the long run.

                                                                  jms
