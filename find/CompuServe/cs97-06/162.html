<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; As soon as you can comment, would you please tell us who at TNT
&gt; we should send our thank you's to?

      Thanks should probably be conveyed to Brad Siegel, president of
TNT, who fought hard to get the show, initially beating the Sci-Fi
Channel out in a bidding war for the reruns, and who believes very
strongly in what we're doing for the future.

                                                                  jms
