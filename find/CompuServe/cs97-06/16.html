<pre> Catherine Becic &lt;73414.2603@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; How could G'Kar, who has gone through great revelations, not see
&gt; the validity to Londo's proposition?

       Thanks...if G'Kar came around too easily or quickly, it would
ring false; it had to go through some time and reflection.  But even
though one could certainly agree with his anger over what's happened,
G'Kar has to try and overcome that and even transcend it.

                                                                  jms
