<pre> Phil Lenton &lt;100572.61@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is is true that Jerry Doyle does not appear in the TNT TV movies?

      We weren't able to work out a deal with Jerry for the two
movies, but he will be in the fifth season, and a third TV movie which
TNT has indicated they'd like us to do.

                                                                  jms
