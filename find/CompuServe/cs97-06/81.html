<pre> Kirk R. Darling &lt;73063.3115@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Do you think it was a matter of the programming that kept him
&gt; from stopping the fight?

      Also, Wade specificially says Lise wasn't there when they got
back, so that eliminates her from the scenario.

      BTW...there's apparently going to be a positive review of 418,
"Intersections in Real Time" in the Monday USA Today.  I haven't seen
it yet, though, so don't know what spoilers it may contain.

                                                                  jms
