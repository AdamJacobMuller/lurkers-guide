<pre> T.P. Chai &lt;104674.3064@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I have a question; the things that Lyta told Stephen, was that
&gt; what Bester was threatening her as her "past", back in
&gt; Epiphanies?

       No, Franklin's comment to Lyta didn't involve her past, though
we will find out more about that in a bit.

                                                                  jms
