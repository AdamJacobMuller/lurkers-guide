      Thanks.  Gradually, we're learning and acquiring more tools to
use in the storytelling process...refining what we have, and every so
often, we try to use them in new ways.  It's an experiment, and a risk,
but one worth taking when it gets a reaction like this.  Thanks.

                                                                  jms
