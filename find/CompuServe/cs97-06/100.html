<pre> Richard M. Perry &lt;76461.2737@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; (they even gave a picture of him) The question posed was, "What
&gt; makes someone a fan of science fiction?"

      Actually, I'd more or less forgotten having done the article,
and then when I remembered having done it after your comment, took me a
while to remember what the heck I'd said.  (This is why I'm a terrible
liar, and thus stick almost exclusively to the truth...I ain't smart
enough to be a very good liar.)

      Anyway...thanks.

      The question was one that I get a lot, and I finally decided to
redefine the question and attack it from my own perspective.  I'm glad
it came out reasonably coherent.

      And as for being a fan...yeah, that about covers it.  This is a
show for fans, by fans.  Which is why it works.

                                                                  jms
