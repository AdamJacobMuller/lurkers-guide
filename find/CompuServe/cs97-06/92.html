<pre> Douglas Piligian &lt;70760.2440@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; In the first act after the opening credits when Sheridan is on
&gt; the bridge of the White Star, did we see the "automatic repair
&gt; systems" at work on the wall next to where he was standing, or
&gt; was that just some sort of display?

      Yes, those were the autorepair systems at work.

                                                                  jms
