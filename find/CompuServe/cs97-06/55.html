<pre> Douglas Piligian &lt;70760.2440@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Will Chris be doing anything special for the movies, new score,
&gt; themes, etc? Any chance there will be a new CD with music from the
&gt; movies?

      He'll be scoring the movies, but nothing's set yet for a
soundtrack for either of them (commercially).

                                                                  jms
