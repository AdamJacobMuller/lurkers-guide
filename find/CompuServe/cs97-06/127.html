<pre> Philip Friel &lt;100647.753@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Do Warner Bros pay any attention to the opinions of overseas
&gt; viewers, or are only the opinions of viewers in the US taken into
&gt; consideration? In other words, would it be a waste of time writing
&gt; to them, or would it do some good? Also, what is preferable, an
&gt; email, or a written letter? If your answer is in the affirmative,
&gt; could you please give me the email or snailmail address (and
&gt; name) that it would be most useful to send the letter to?

       Thanks, and I think you're right about the long-term success of
the show.

       As for WB, strangely they almost exclusively consider the
American market when making their decisions; they still view European
markets as an after-market.

                                                                  jms
