<pre> Douglas Piligian &lt;70760.2440@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Did you know the writer?
&gt; Will TNT be doing similar types of hype as we get closer to
&gt; January, 1998?

      No, didn't know the writer prior to the article.

      TNT has a big campaign planned for the January launch...for the
first time, really, B5 is getting the full-fledged PR campaign it (in
my opinion) has deserved for a long time.

      TNT has been nothing other than terrific.

                                                                  jms
