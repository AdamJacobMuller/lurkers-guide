<pre> Douglas Piligian &lt;70760.2440@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Was he familiar with the show prior to getting the guest role?
&gt; If not what, if any, information do you provide to a guest about
&gt; the story to date? Zimbalist?

      Nope, just figured he'd be great for the job, and cast him
without audition.  He didn't know anything about the show before that.

                                                                  jms
