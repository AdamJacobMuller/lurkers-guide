         Thanks.  One thing I've been doing with the latter part of
season 4 is to experiment a little more, try different things.  I feel
that we need to push visually to try new things, the sort of visual
techniques you don't see much in SF-TV, which for the most part is
fairly prosaic as these things go. And to push the writing, to try some
things that may succeed, or may fail, but you learn something either
way.  In its way, next week's ep is just as experimental, but in a very
different direction.

      Mike Vejar definitely did a great job with this episode.

                                                                  jms
