<pre> Roseann M. Caputo &lt;103510.1542@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Have you read "The Sandman" and if so, what do you think?

       I loved "The Sandman," though I haven't read it lately (haven't
read much of anything lately).  Gaiman's a tremendous talent, and I
will always go out of my way to find his stuff.

                                                                  jms
