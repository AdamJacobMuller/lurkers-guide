      What Delenn says, if we all go back to the episode in question,
that a Minbari appeared to her, when she was a child lost in the city
and wandered into the temple; a vision, telling her that "I will not
allow harm to come to my little ones here in my great house."  (Note:
"my little ones" being a coy bit of foreshadowing to her being a child
of Valen, but never mind that for now.)

      Obviously there were many drawings and pictures and records of
Valen, but most were destroyed in the Great War.  And those that
survived have been, over a thousand years, idealized and distorted by
whichever caste is currently claiming him as theirs.  (Valen refused to
belong to any one caste.)

      Which, btw, is also what Delenn referred to in season one, when
she was lost and in fear of death, and she looked to Sinclair with
reverence and said, "I knew you would come for me."

                                                                  jms
