"I thought the fight was a bit too long for much the same reason as
you. All I can suggest is that John's metabolism isn't "normal" any
more, and perhaps this had an effect. (And maybe the bullyboys were
doing less damage than we think, simply to prolong the "fun".)"

       1) It was for dramatic/stylistic effect.  Not everything done
with some style has to have a scientific explanation.

       2) Having been mugged myself, time expands and slows down.

       3) It's the TV cliche that fights are over in a second.  Ask
anyone who's ever been in a real knock-down fight.  It goes on a heck
of a lot longer than we showed here.  When I got mugged it went on for
10 minutes.

       One of the ironies in other messages on this (not this one here
specifically) is that some have noted the fast-paced editing, which is
supposedly associated with music video/short attention span
material...and then turn around and say it wasn't over fast enough.

                                                                  jms
