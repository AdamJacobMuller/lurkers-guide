       Actually, no, you're right, ther isn't that much direct,
personal violence in the show.  My feeling is that if you do that a
lot, it loses any potential for impact.  You only pull out that card
when you really need it, to best effect...don't waste it.  It's like
harsh language, after you've heard someone going on using all the more
remarkable Anglo-Saxon words for a while, it loses all impact.

                                                                  jms
