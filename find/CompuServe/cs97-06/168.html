<pre> Batman &lt;104635.1044@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Makes sense?
&gt; Other than it's about damn time those pin-heads at TV Guide woke
&gt; up and realized there's more to Sc-Fi TV than Star Trek? Is this a
&gt; hint that there will possibly be two different covers???? How
&gt; about the B5 ball cap worn by Sheridan during batting practice
&gt; (or is this what you were talkng about)????? Was that KNIVES?
&gt; The one where he gets "possessed"????
&gt; How about T-Shirts, or long-sleeve T's printed up to look like
&gt; the "Army Of Light" Uniforms? Or how about T-Shirts with the B5
&gt; Sword logo on them? And when may we expect the line of action
&gt; figures?????

      Yes, the ball cap is the same one he wore at batting practice. 
(Wore it today, in fact, meeting Neil Gaiman and Harlan for dinner.)

                                                                  jms
