<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;75063.3305@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I mean, he has nothing else really to live for at the moment,
&gt; does he? I really wonder what the rest of our heroes were doing
&gt; during the several days (judging by his beard growth) that
&gt; Sheridan was in captivity? Could he be a vision as well?
&gt; As Delenn was a reminder of John's hopes and dreams, might the
&gt; Drazi be a reminder of his dreads and nightmares? Was there a
&gt; conscious decision on your part to cast Wayne for a role in an
&gt; episode that had such an obvious common theme with his first role
&gt; in the series? Won't everyone be royally pissed when you reveal in
&gt; 419 that John was really in a CyberNet all along?

      The Drazi was really there...has to be, or the ep loses some of
its teeth.

      And yeah, we kinda liked the symmetry of Wayne being in this ep.

                                                                  jms
