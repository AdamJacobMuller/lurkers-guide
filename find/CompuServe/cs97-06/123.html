<pre> T.P. Chai &lt;104674.3064@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; But don't all teeps, official ones anyway, work "for" Clark?
&gt; so why does it matter?
&gt; also do they still have the technology that reprogrammed Talia,
&gt; or did that go away with the Shadows?

       It matters because there are plenty of alien teeps out there as
well as human ones, and you can always get a rogue in there.

                                                                  jms
