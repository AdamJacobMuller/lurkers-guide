<pre> colin heaps &lt;100622.3610@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Was this instigated by you, or did they approach you with the
&gt; idea? Given that you commented that you have never heard of this
&gt; happening before - how did it make you feel when you found out? 
&gt; surprised / relieved? Her constant moan being that she forgets the
&gt; timeline of certain parts of the story because there is so much
&gt; to it, "was that Season 2 or 3 - eh?? one?

      Thanks for all the kind words, from you and your wife.

      Yes, my philosophy, from what you've said and others have said,
seems close to Pal's, in that if you leave creative people alone, and
give them the creative freedom to go nuts, they'll do more for you than
if you bash them down all the time.  It's a simple notion but for some
reason unfathomable to many suits.

      As for the extension, that was something WB asked for, it didn't
originate from our side.

      And I'm very happy that the show has gotten the reception it
has; makes it all kinda worthwhile.

                                                                  jms
