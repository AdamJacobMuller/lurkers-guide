<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; My instantaneous thought was " Bester!??"
&gt; Then the camera cut to Kirk and McCoy, and I thought, " What the
&gt; heck are they doing on Minbair?

      I *think* that's a good thing....

      What's been great about B5 has been the chance to give many
talented actors like Walter and others a chance to show the many other
hues and colors they are capable of delivering, but which were rarely
seen because the material didn't allow them the opportunity.  I know
Walter's loved it, and it's been great for us as well.

                                                                  jms
