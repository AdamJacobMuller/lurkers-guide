<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Joe, Which of the paperback books is true to the story?

       The Drennan book, just hitting the stands now, is 100% canon;
the Cavelos book, out for a bit now, is about 90% canon.  (Those are
books 7 and 9.)

                                                                  jms
