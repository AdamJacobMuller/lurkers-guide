       You're wrong.  The costumer has never even *seen* the Prisoner,
as far as I know, and the suit he wore was one of our standard earth
suits which we've used before on the show, just tailored it to fit his
form.  And the set design is just your basic black room with chairs,
nothing more.  I also doubt muchly that Flinn has ever seen The
Prisoner...which was a very well and brightly lit show, whereas this
played to darkness.

                                                                  jms
