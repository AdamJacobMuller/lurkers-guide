<pre> John Bovenmyer &lt;73567.1341@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Now we've got 3 cliffhangers: 1) What happens to Sheridan?
&gt; 2) How long do we have to wait to find out?
&gt; 3) Do we get season five or will Joe wrap this in just 3 more
&gt; episodes, at least one of which is already in the can?! Are
&gt; _Between the Darkness and the Light_ and _Endgame_ being deferred
&gt; to maintain wriggle room still for season 5, are they done, or
&gt; did you film enough so you could edit them down to work with
&gt; either 4 or 5 season runs after the cast was done shooting?

      Best to wait and see what's in mind for those later episodes.

                                                                  jms
