""The Face of the Enemy" might represent the flipside of young
Delenn's claim in "Atonement" that the most dangerous enemy is the one
you know nothing about.  Now the face of the enemy is the one you know
all too well, one which you take for granted until it's revealed that
the face is actually a mask."

      Yep.  It's one thing facing implacable, vast enemies...it's
quite another when you friend betrays you.  That's personal.
