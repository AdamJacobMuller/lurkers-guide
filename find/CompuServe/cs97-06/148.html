<H2>B5 Legacy?</H2>
<h3>Date: 25 Jun 1997 21:39:13 -0700</h3>
<pre> Rebecca Eschliman &lt;76072.2345@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Of what would you feel most proud as a legacy of B5 to the
&gt; television culture?

      I'd say the introduction of an epic or saga-like structure to
the TV format.  A novel for TV, using all the literary devices of
fiction, over the course of years.  I think, in the long run, that's
what B5 will be most noted for.

                                                                  jms
