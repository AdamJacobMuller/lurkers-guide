"Is the cast under contract for season five, should it happen?.  Now
that you've wrapped the final episode, is there any danger of losing
Bruce, Claudia, Jerry, Mira, etc to other committments while you wait
to see if season is a go?"

      No, the contracts have nothing to do with that episode, we still
have options on all our cast members.

"You mentioned that you were already shooting Thirdspace, the first B5
movie. Wasn't "In The Beginning" the Minbari war story going to be
first?"

      The prequel is aired first, but produced second, because B5
didn't exist during the prequel time period, so rather than tear and
and rebuild sets, we're doing Thirdspace first.

                                                                  jms
