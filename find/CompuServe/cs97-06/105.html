<pre> Bruce "Firestorm" S. &lt;72571.1722@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; What made you change your mind on the sequel now that you're
&gt; pushing for a sequel about the Rangers?

"As I recall, previously, you said that you wouldn't do any Babylon 5
sequels and that you would go to other projects like writing novels &amp;
etc.  What made you change your mind on the sequel now that you're
pushing for a sequel about the Rangers?"

      Nope.  I said that the B5 story per se ended in 5 years.  I have
also said, *from the very start*, as the old timers here, and at
conventions, will testify, that there was always a side-story that
could go off and be a different novel set in the same universe.  So
you'll understand why I can't really defend a statement that I never
made.

                                                                  jms
