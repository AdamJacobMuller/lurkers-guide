<pre> Rebecca Eschliman &lt;76072.2345@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; G'Kar seems to know that it's Mollari at his door -- why else
&gt; would he wait so long to call, "Enter?" But how did he know -- was
&gt; it an official request by Londo? Both characters' natural
&gt; inclination is to the bombastic, but both operated in a quite
&gt; muted fashion -- does this indicate honesty?

"G'Kar seems to know that it's Mollari at his door -- why else would
he wait so long to call, "Enter?"  But how did he know -- was it an
official request by Londo?"

      If you recall, when Garibaldi visited Vir, Vir mentioned that
Londo was arranging a meeting with G'Kar, so it was definitely set up
in advance.
