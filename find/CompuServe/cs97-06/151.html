<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Is that just my imagination?
&gt; Just how much do we know about Delenn's background?
&gt; Does John know more?
&gt; Are they out there somewhere, and I just missed them?
&gt; Is there a bio of her in the lurkers guide?

       Your perception is basically correct; I kept Delenn's
background more vague to add to her mystery, and made Sheridan's more
specific and grounded to tie him more to Earth and more accessible.

                                                                  jms
