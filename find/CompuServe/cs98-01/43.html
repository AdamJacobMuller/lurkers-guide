<pre> Michael L. Wonch &lt;73373.3533@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I can't remember his real world name(sin of sins, I know), but
&gt; when Seridan replaced Sinclair, was that planned from the
&gt; beginning? I mean, did the actor leave the show, for some reason?

      No, that's something that developed over time.

                                                                  jms
