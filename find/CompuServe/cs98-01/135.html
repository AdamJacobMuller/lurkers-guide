<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Has it, ultimately, been worth the struggle for you?

      Has it been worth it for me?  Yeah, I think it has...it's been
tough, but worthwhile.  What matters is if, in the long run, viewers
will think it was worth it.  Me, I was gonna be here anyway, and the
story was gonna tell itself in my brain anyway, so I may as well have
gone along with it....

                                                                  jms
