<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Is there any truth to this story?
&gt; Will you be at the London premieres?
&gt; Should I start planning trips to London in July and October?

      No one's said anything to me about it thus far...the first I
heard of it was in that article.

                                                                  jms
