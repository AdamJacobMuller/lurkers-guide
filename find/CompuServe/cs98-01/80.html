<pre> Michael Beemer &lt;71551.1670@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; BTW, I presume the original contracts with all the actors
&gt; specified residuals for the first "X" broadcasts, and that since
&gt; TNT will actually be broadcasting the episodes beyond that limit
&gt; (where PTEN probably wouldn't), that all involved are seeing
&gt; money they'd otherwise hope for but not expect? Am I right in that
&gt; (convoluted as it may be &lt;g&gt;)?

      This is all standard stuff with the various guilds.

                                                                  jms
