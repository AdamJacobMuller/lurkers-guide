      That's Sinclair's reading.

"My only criticism is that the end of it is a bit too Sheridan heavy,
and it would have been nice to have a Garibaldi line somewhere,
although I can't think of one offhand which would have fit."

      Neither could I...which is why it ain't there.

                                                                  jms
