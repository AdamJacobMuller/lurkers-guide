<H2>Kosh (Spoilers to ITF)</H2>
<h3>Date: 01 Jan 1998 23:32:14 -0700</h3>
<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Will we ever learn more about Kosh I and why he was more
&gt; sympathetic to the Second Ones than Kosh II, or is the Vorlons'
&gt; place in the saga over?

      That's a good question, and one of the things I'd like to do
(but which I can't see any way to do in the series) is the whole story
of who Kosh was, how he got to be who and what he was, why he felt the
way he did toward humans (part of it was knowing Valen)...maybe this
will have to go into one of the novels.

                                                                  jms
