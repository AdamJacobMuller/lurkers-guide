"I nearly cried when the President asked the military to "hold the
line" so that a pitiful few hundred could escape. In that single
moment, you feel that even if the Minbari had done it, those few
refugees would have sired a people who, eventually, would have made it.
Just at that moment, you see the echo to the ball of light flying into
the encounter suit a million years hence."

      It's a very moving scene, even for me.  There's something in
particular about a female president making that request, and giving
those orders, that is especially strong.  I don't know why that should
be, but somehow it is. We as a people tend to forget our own strength,
and as Londo says, our stubborn nobility.  We only seem to remember it
when we stand on the edge of the abyss, when it's almost too late to do
anything about it.

"I always have felt this show is about him."

      Yeah, in many ways, it is.

                                                                  jms
