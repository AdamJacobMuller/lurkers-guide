"It's a very clever ploy, but it had the danger of turning off those
of us who didn't realize that there was an underlying plan."

      Yeah, it was a risky thing to do...but I figured that if we did
it right, that would turn around eventually.  You just have to hold
true to your plan and not get discouraged and wait until the rest of
the world catches up to you.

"In retrospect, it's *all* right there, but initially, I had to many
prejudices to allow myself to see it.  I expected an attempt to copy
Star Trek by someone who didn't understand SF, and I was going to see
that, no matter what."

      Don't worry about it...this happened to a *lot* of people.
