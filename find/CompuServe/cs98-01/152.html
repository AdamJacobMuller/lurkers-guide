<pre> SysOp_Dupa_T_Parrot &lt;70040.104@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; You once said that season 5 would be all "Wham" episodes; is that
&gt; still your plan? So does this mean that B5 will invade the Super
&gt; Bowl?

      Thanks...haven't actually seen the cheeseheads one, though I had
to rewrite the copy (and the other one with the football player)
because they didn't quite get the show or the character.  Don't know if
they stuck with my changes or not.

                                                                  jms
