<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;75063.3305@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; When the episode opened with Sheridan and Delenn in their
&gt; quarters, I asked, "Is this going to be the way every episode of
&gt; season five starts?" But can Delenn let it go so easily?
&gt; Londo knows about John's twenty years?
&gt; Just how common is this knowledge?
&gt; Boy, when you say that the first episode is just to get the new
&gt; viewers up to speed, and then you take off in the second, you
&gt; ain't kiddin', are ya?

      Rangers never bluff.
