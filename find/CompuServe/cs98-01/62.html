<pre> Mark Fountain &lt;74023.221@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Did you consider putting the scene of the hunter confronting the
&gt; Minbari at the battle of the line into the movie? Was that a once
&gt; considered story line that didn't make the cut?

"Did you consider putting the scene of the hunter confronting the
Minbari at the battle of the line into the movie?"

      Yeah, for some time, in fact...but the logistics involved in
staging a full-scale assault, dozens of soul hunters, the fight itself,
would've taken up about 10-15 minutes minimum, which would have had to
come out elsewhere, and I can't find 15 minutes in that movie that's
expendable.  One can only do so much in the amout of space, and time,
and money, one has.

"One is a picture of what appears to be a soul hunter craft crashed
into a jungle scene beside a Mayan looking temple.  At the time I just
assumed that eventually an episode would bring that to light, but
nothing ever has."

      No, that's an image Ron did on his own, had nothing to do with
the show.

                                                                  jms
