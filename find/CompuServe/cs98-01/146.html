<pre> Michael Rubinstein &lt;74012.147@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Faith manages, right?
&gt; Isn't the Psi Corps still formally a branch of EarthGov?
&gt; If so, then wasn't Captain Lochley duty-bound to report Byron's
&gt; people to the Psi Cops as soon as she found out that they were
&gt; rogues? Or is she really not working for Earth anymore?
&gt; If that is the case, then why the EarthForce uniform?
&gt; If the interests of B5 and of Earth should ever diverge, then
&gt; whose interests is Captain Lochley *supposed* to serve?

      You're correct; we always start out slow each
season...especially in this case, knowing that we're going to get a lot
of new viewers, I structured the show so it would bring folks up to
date asap on who everybody is, and where things stand.  Believe me,
there's plenty of tragedy and pathos lurking right around the corner. 
It picks up at the end of the season, after some very rough things for
the characters, because I can't end it all on a downer, but at the same
time, it has to have meat to it.

"Isn't the Psi Corps still formally a branch of EarthGov? If so, then
wasn't Captain Lochley duty-bound to report Byron's people to the Psi
Cops as soon as she found out that they were rogues?"

      You'll find that question answered soon enough.
