      Thing is, I think we're taking the term "spoilers" and taking it
to a new level of definition that simply isn't valid.  A spoiler means
getting information on an episode that hasn't aired yet in one's area,
it doesn't refer to things that a) have happened long ago, or b) one
may not have seen the first time it aired.  I just don't think it's a
valid approach on the face of it.

                                                                  jms
