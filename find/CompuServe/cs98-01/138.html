<pre> Evan Zucker &lt;73067.1455@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; What do other people think?

      I always find remarks like yours amusing...since the Star Trek
shows are currently using the same systems, CGI, and in many cases, the
same animators who worked on the first 3 years of B5 via the same
company that we helped to set in place, Foundation Imaging.

      The difference is not in the perceived, but in the perceiver.

                                                                  jms
