<H2>Season 5 - Final 10?</H2>

<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Any truth to this report?
&gt; Am I reading too much into this, or are we going to get a "bonus
&gt; episode" somewhere along the line in S5?

      No, this season you get 22 episodes, no extras in the series.

      Re: the schedule...it was brought to our attention that the NBA
coverage would lead to episodes being shunted around and pre-empted for
a number of weeks.  Obviously this concerned us, and would concern
viewers, so we discussed it with TNT, and they came back to us with the
notion that we would continue new episodes until hitting #100, break
for the NBA games, then come back (starting with another possible
half-hour special) afterward at the same time to finish the season.

      It was either this, or get shuffled around the schedule due to
the NBA, and the former is infinitely preferable.

                                                                  jms
