<pre> Scott J. Epstein &lt;71514.2733@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Could Delenn have interceded and prevented the Rangers from
&gt; accepting Lennier? Obviously, she absolutley *would* not, but
&gt; could she have?

      Thanks...and yes, she could have...but it would have devastated
him and undermined the Ranger structure.

                                                                  jms
