<pre> Ray Pelzer &lt;70475.1263@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; will we be seeing Vir's wife this final season?
&gt; any chances of Harlan sitting down with DM, since he's already
&gt; been on Politically Incorrect so often?

      No, no plans for Vir's wife this season.  He has enough troubles
to deal with....

                                                                  jms
