<pre> Gardner L. Harris &lt;76657.3333@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Joe, was there a specific reason that the original DeLenn facial
&gt; prosthetics were not more closely duplicated for the prequel?

      It made more sense to put it in line with the series, since
there's 22 of the first season, and only 1 of the pilot.

                                                                  jms
