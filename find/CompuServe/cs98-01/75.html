      TNT did some market research prior to the launch of B5, and the
two questions they wanted answered were, what does a new viewer need to
tune in to B5, and what do the current viewers need to bring them in to
watch again?

      The research told them all the things they had to include, and
do, and say, to get the new viewers...and then when they got to what
the current viewers need:

      "They just need to know when it's on."

      I think that's when they began to sense something rather massive
lurking just beneath the radar nets....

                                                                  jms
