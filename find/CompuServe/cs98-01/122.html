<H2>Season 5 Intro</H2>

      Except, of course, that the Clark aspect is mentioned several
times over the course of season 5.

      Basically, it seems to me a tad over the top to expect that the
new season 5 episodes should not contain information that's a spoiler
for 1-4; you may as well not MAKE the show on that basis.  If you're
going to tune in to S5 after not seeing 1-4, you're going to learn
things you didn't know; that can't be helped, and I can't see the
wisdom in hobbling the show for all the rest of the years to come to
protect a few newbies in the current season who, if they're THAT
concerned about being spoiled, shouldn't be watching.

      This seems to me at times a bit like the v-chip discussion...do
we have to protect everybody all the time and let them never assume any
kind of responsibility for their own actions?  Seems that deprives them
of free will and free choice, all in the name of "protecting" them.

                                                                  jms
