      Oh, she has a sense of humor...but we don't see it here in this
episode any more than when Ivanova first came in, because both are in
new situations and that requires a certain degree of seriousness. 
We'll see some of her humor along the way...it's also different from
Ivanova's, more a sly kind of humor, the sort that slips past you and
ricochets around the corner half an hour later to nail you between the
eyes.

                                                                  jms
