<H2>TNT Won't Show All...?</H2>

&gt; Sure, they push it like crazy, but they tend to start it slightly
&gt; off the top of the hour, run inane little tie-in clips that
&gt; insult the show (transporters for the Rough Cut crew?

      This came out of discussions with TNT when it came out that we
would have to be pre-empted and shuffled around for the NBA playoffs. 
It made more sense to let them go through unobstructed, then come back
afterward in the same slot rather than forcing fans to go hunting
again.  It's not a big.
