<pre> Terry Berkes &lt;75050.2767@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; In the scene with Franklin and the very upset Ivanova, when she
&gt; uses the word "boffed" (like Marcus), was this intended as just a
&gt; cute scene or a hint that the transfer would have had lasting
&gt; effects?

"In the scene with Franklin and the very upset Ivanova, when she uses

      No, nothing more was intended than what was seen.

                                                                  jms
