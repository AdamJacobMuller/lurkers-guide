<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Is it going to remain like this?
&gt; wouldn't Franklin feel weird, being the only one still with the
&gt; "Delenn" uniform?

      It's a mix-and-match world this season, showing the disparate
parts of the B5 world after the various worlds as they have kind of
blown apart, as they gradually come back together again.

                                                                  jms
