<pre> Craig M. Bobchin &lt;102354.3246@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Should those be open all the way through, or should the be closed
&gt; off partially through the tunnel? Or does it not make a bit of
&gt; difference?

      Shouldn't really make any difference...you can close 'em if you
want, but it's okay either way.

      Revell did a good job and they were very patient...we kept
coming back to them with corrections, and even when they didn't have to
do them, as the deadline came up, they made the changes anyway.  I
can't speak highly enough of them.

      If you want to own a starfury, folks, now's your chance.

                                                                  jms
