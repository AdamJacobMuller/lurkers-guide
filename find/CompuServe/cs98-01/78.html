<H2>Did I _really_ see...?</H2>
<h3>Date: 11 Jan 1998 19:14:10 -0700</h3>
<pre> Kevin Wood &lt;100337.272@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is this just a figment of my overactive imagination, and a desire
&gt; to get more B5, or is there something more to it? PPS - is it true
&gt; that the BtVS crew whipped the B5 crew at paintball?

      Optic Nerve, the ones who do B5 prosthetics, also do them for
Buffy, so there some understandable similarities from time to time
(like when they used a good chunk of n'grath for one shot).

"PPS - is it true that the BtVS crew whipped the B5 crew at
paintball?"

      Nope.  We beat them.

                                                                  jms
