<pre> Ray Pelzer &lt;70475.1263@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; So, does this mean the shadow-helpers didn't actually do the
&gt; destruction? Perhaps the Centauri did it trying to drive them out?

      That Kosh, always a mumbler.

"Londo said "...look what _we_ did to _ourselves_...." when he looked
out the window.  So, does this mean the shadow-helpers didn't actually
do the destruction?  Perhaps the Centauri did it trying to drive them
out?"

      You'll get the answer to that one soon enough.

                                                                  jms
