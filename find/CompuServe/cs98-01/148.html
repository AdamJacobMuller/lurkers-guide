      Thanks...it's easy to mistake the actor for the character in
situations like this.

      It's a vastly different character from Ivanova also, not meant
to fit in the same place, do the same things, or be the same person. 
They're both strong characters, but different in their approach. 
Ivanova tended to be a shouter, and on the impatient side...Lochley is
a thinker, and more inclined to the blade than the ball-bat.  But both
are equally lethal.

      Lochley, I think, also has the maturity of character you need to
rise to the rank of captain in the military, and the voice of moral
authority, which both Sinclair and Sheridan had, in comparable
positions.

                                                                  jms
