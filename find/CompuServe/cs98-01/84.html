&gt; And when B5 finishes its run (sob) we are on the lookout for the
&gt; JMS touch in other projects -- maybe you'll be involved in

      I dunno...film really isn't my venue.  In TV, the writer is in
charge; film is conceded as a director's medium.  I'm too cranky to
turn it over to a director, and too busy writing to direct...so I guess
that leaves me to TV.

                                                                  jms
