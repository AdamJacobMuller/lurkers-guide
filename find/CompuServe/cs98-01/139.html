<H2>ITB: Minb. ship trashed?</H2>
<h3>Date: 24 Jan 1998 23:54:10 -0700</h3>
<pre> Daniel Barer &lt;74033.167@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Does this mean that Sheridan's was not the only ship that
&gt; destroyed a Minbari battleship during the war? Was his the only
&gt; ship to do so and survive? Or did the Minbari ship actually
&gt; survive, albeit with a big hole in the middle? What do you think?

"In the "2 years" montage in "In The Beginning", we see an Earth
Alliance ship ram a Minbari cruiser amidships, blowing a hole through
its middle. Does this mean that Sheridan's was not the only ship that
destroyed a Minbari battleship during the war?"

      Sheridan was the only one to score a *victory* against a Minbari
war cruiser.  Meaning he survived.  Ramming one, and dying in the
process, ain't a victory...at best it's a draw.

                                                                  jms
