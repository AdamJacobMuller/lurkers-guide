<pre> Tom Knudsen &lt;72347.1626@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Can you say if you broke and cable network records?

      No, didn't break records, but we didn't have to and didn't
expect to.

      We just had to succeed.

      We did.

                                                                  jms
