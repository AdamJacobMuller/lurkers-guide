      Yeah, Bruce is definitely an SF fan.  He tends to show up every
so often at a couple of SF bookstores here in LA, startling the hell
out of everybody, picking up the latest stuff.  And he and Jerry have
built up a great working relationship with NASA, having gone out to the
Cape to watch several launches and help promote the space program on
their own time.

                                                                  jms
