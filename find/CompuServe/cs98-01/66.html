<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Omission?
&gt; Something that is on the cutting room floor?

      No, there wasn't time to do it in the movie...it would've taken
about 10-15 minutes to set it up and pay it off properly, and I
couldn't find 15 expendable minutes in ItB.  There's a brief window
after the body's death where the soul hunters can still move in, so
there was time...we showed their ships moving in in Atonement, and to
do so again here would get in the way and really confuse new viewers.

                                                                  jms
