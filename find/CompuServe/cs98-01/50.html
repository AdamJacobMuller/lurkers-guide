<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Is this trip still on, and if so, do you have any info about it?

      I'm having to buckle down and finish writing S5 and getting the
third movie written, so I'm stuck out here.

      It's a curious thought...I just turned in 519, which means with
just these last 3 scripts, I'm done writing the Babylon 5 series.  (The
third movie is outside the series in terms of one-hour episodes.) 
After ten years, I'm 3 scripts away from being done with this thing.

                                                                  jms
