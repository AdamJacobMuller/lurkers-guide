<pre> Carl Cantarella &lt;105030.3700@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Would you ever consider doing something like this with the Valen
&gt; character somewhere down the line for television, such as in
&gt; "Crusade"?

      I think there may be some way to tell the story of Valen down
the road in one form or another.

                                                                  jms
