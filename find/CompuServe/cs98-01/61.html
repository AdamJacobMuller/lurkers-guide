<pre> Brian Prothero &lt;76711.663@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Any chance on rebroadcasting the re-edited pilot given the
&gt; suprisingly high ratings? Also, will the re-edited version of "The
&gt; Gathering" ever be released on video (VHS, DVD or Laserdisc)?

      I think the rebroadcast will happen in a couple of months on TG;
the rest is in the works but nothing's happening in the short run.

                                                                  jms
