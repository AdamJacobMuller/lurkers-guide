<H2>Sheridan, the Messiah?</H2>
<h3>Date: 21 Jan 1998 14:12:13 -0700</h3>
<pre> WhiteWitch &lt;104047.2451@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Was this intentional?
&gt; Or have I been watching King of Kings, Ben Hur, and that lot way
&gt; too much?

      There's certainly a messianic streak running through the
character, though he himself might challenge that notion.

                                                                  jms
