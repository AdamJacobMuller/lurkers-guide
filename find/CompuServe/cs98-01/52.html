<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; When were the Ivanova promos that run at the end of the season 1
&gt; shows filmed? Before or after the contract difficulties?
&gt; If after, does this mean we really might see some guest roles for
&gt; Christian? If before, do you have to get additional permission (?)
&gt; or pay actors for these promo spots in addition to their
&gt; contract?

      Those promos were shot during the end of the fourth season.

                                                                  jms
