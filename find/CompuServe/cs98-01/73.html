"There was one notable flashback scene that did not make it into the
movie, in which Sinclair rushes Delenn and pulls her hood off.  Also we
never saw Sinclair surrounded by the Grey Council and blasted by the
staff.  Given how "In the Beginning" progressed I'm not sure how those
scenes could have fit in."

      This happened shortly after the events shown.
