<pre> Robert A. Matern &lt;70012.3660@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Who owns the rights to that PTEN intro music now that PTEN is
&gt; defunct???

      No, that belongs to PTEN, which is now defunct...it announced
the distributer.  TNT is the new distributer, so it's gone...as you
wouldn't see the NBC logo if ABC started carrying the former's show.

                                                                  jms
