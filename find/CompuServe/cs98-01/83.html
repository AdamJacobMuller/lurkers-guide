<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Shouldn't the exterior portion of the station counter-rotate in
&gt; relation to the interior portion? Or did I miss something and the
&gt; inner section is divided into two halves that spin in opposite
&gt; directions? Or should I not eat spicy food late at night just
&gt; prior to going to sleep??

      There is a counter-rotating flywheel configuration...it only
looks like it's stationary because it's maintaining that relative speed
against the rotation of the lower section.

                                                                  jms
