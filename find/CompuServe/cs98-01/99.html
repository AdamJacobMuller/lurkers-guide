<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;75063.3305@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; What do you think about the possibility that Babylon 5, a program
&gt; that dared the throw away the industry formulas and cliches, is
&gt; becoming a new industry formula and cliche? But how do you feel
&gt; about the possibility of so many others emulating your style, not
&gt; because they want to be creative, but because they want to jump
&gt; on the bandwagon of what is looking to be a successful concept
&gt; and application?

      I don't feel we've yet achieved sufficient visibility on the
Hollywood radar screens for that to be much of a problem at the moment,
and at this point I only have time for problems of the moment....
