<pre> Craig M. Bobchin &lt;102354.3246@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Did you know at the outset of Season 2 that Franklin, G'kar and
&gt; Sheridan had met before? If so how come no mention was ever made
&gt; of that fact?

      Yeah, in my notes on Sheridan I had him meeting Sheridan before,
but never did much with it at the time...we never see the first time
Sheridan and Franklin meet in the second season, and when we do they're
hanging out pretty casually, as people who've met each other before
might.  Bear in mind, also, that there's about 11 years between the two
incidents, and at best they were casual acquaintances on one mission.

                                                                  jms
