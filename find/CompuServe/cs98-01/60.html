<pre> Tom Knudsen &lt;72347.1626@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Since Kosh and Ulkesh seem to have the authority to dictate
&gt; Vorlon policy from what you've said, can we assume that they were
&gt; near the top of the Vorlon heirarchy (whatever THAT may be)?

      It's not a hierarchy as you or I would understand it...and the
weird thing is, though I kinda know how it functions, I'll be damned if
I can figure out how to explain it in words.

                                                                  jms
