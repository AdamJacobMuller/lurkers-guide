<pre> Steve Ringley &lt;73727.1202@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; If the Minbari kill him before he fulfills his destiny as it
&gt; were, doesn't everything change?

      Yes, it would change history, if it happened...but since it did
not happen, history was unchanged.

                                                                  jms
