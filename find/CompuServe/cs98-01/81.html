<pre> Carl Cantarella &lt;105030.3700@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Am I wrong to ask you about this, or do you see it at all
&gt; similarly?

      No, he spoke to me about his approach to the role in WWE, and he
said that he wanted to play it distant, that in a way, Sinclair had
already gone beyond, was more mystical and reserved.  Hence the
difference.

                                                                  jms
