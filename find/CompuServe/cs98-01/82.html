<pre> Kevin Wood &lt;100337.272@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; MOI, how do you handle things like this?
&gt; Do you copyright the appearance of certain races, or what?

      The way it usually works is this...most such companies do
recycle stuff, it's a given.  They are just under the obligation to
change 50% minimum between what's done for a different show and the new
item.

                                                                  jms
