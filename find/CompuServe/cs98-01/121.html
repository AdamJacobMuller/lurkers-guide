      Thanks...yeah, Tracy's doing a bang-up job for us, and fits
right in. So much for the few who worried we'd bring in a "babe" with a
softer, more submissive attitude, which I heard endlessly in some
corners.  Amazing how often people are willing to dismiss stuff out of
hand.  She's gonna be great.

                                                                  jms
