<pre> Akua Lezli Hope &lt;71220.1665@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; The resounding of familiar visual themes: the asassin reminded us
&gt; of the shadow-agent, especially in killing the "Queens" (was that
&gt; their name? having to deliver it himself?
&gt; Of course he was hungry, hadn't he gone without sleep and
&gt; sustenance to create the unsaid words? Will we ever get to read
&gt; the oath of office, or was this a sublimely clever device to
&gt; spare JMS from creating one?

"Why couldn't the young telepath just broadcast his discovery to the
others, vs. having to deliver it himself?"

      Line of sight.
