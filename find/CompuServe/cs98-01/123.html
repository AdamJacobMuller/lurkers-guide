<pre> Scott J. Epstein &lt;71514.2733@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; BTW, I loved that Lorien's question, "Do you have anything worth
&gt; living for?"

      If they don't want any reference to what happened in S4, why are
they watching S5?  That line is no more specific than any other
discussion about the fall of Clark in S5 episodes.

      This is a silly conversation.

                                                                  jms
