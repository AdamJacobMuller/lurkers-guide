"Congratulations on a superb movie."

      Thanks, it's a good one.

"Far better than many of the "blockbuster" films that appeared  in the
theaters this past year.  Hmm, I wonder what you could do with $200
million for one movie?"

      I don't know offhand, but for that kind of money you should
expect at least a 50% cardiac arrest scenario....
