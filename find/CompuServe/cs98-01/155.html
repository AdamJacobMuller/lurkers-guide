<H2>Cards/Comic Due Soon</H2>
<h3>Date: 25 Jan 1998 18:48:11 -0700</h3>
<pre>      Just a general FYI...the Fleer S4 card set has just come in, and
should be appearing soon at stores.  They're gorgeous cards, with not
only the pictures on one side, but also on the same side, a line of
dialogue associated with that character that can only be seen if you
tilt the card; plus some nice (but not excessive in number) chase
cards...real nice.

      And the first issue of the DC comic Valen miniseries just got
into my hands; should be hitting stores the coming week or so.

                                                                  jms
