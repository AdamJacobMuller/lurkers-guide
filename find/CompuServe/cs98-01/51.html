<pre> Rebecca Eschliman &lt;76072.2345@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Are the Soul Hunters (as a civilization) actually *wrong* in
&gt; "preserving" souls? So, is Lorien's "preservation" of Sheridan
&gt; really that different?

      That's the question I wanted to ask in writing TSH...is it a
Good Thing, or is it a Bad Thing, to retain these essences?  So yeah,
that was always a part of it...and as for the resemblance, that's a
valid point also, since when I met with the costume and prosthetics
divisions, I mentioned that I wanted a soul-hunter sort of feel.

                                                                  jms
