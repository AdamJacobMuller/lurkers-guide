<H2>Kosh (Spoilers to ITF)</H2>
<h3>Date: 06 Jan 1998 21:23:09 -0700</h3>
<pre> Philip Hornsey &lt;74053.2101@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; 1) Is Naranek a title and if so what does it mean?
&gt; 2) Is Kosh a title and if so what does *it* mean?
&gt; 3) Why are all Vorlon Kosh?
&gt; 4) What was the relationship between Kosh 1 and Kosh 2 (they
&gt; always seem to be together, as on B4, in Dukhat's quarters,
&gt; backing each other up on B5), and if they were close, it that why
&gt; Kosh 2 was such a hardass in the aftermath of Kosh 1's death? Am I
&gt; close?

      Zha is the usual reference for the future, whose meaning changes
depending on whether it's a suffix or a prefix, and what it's up
against. Isil-zha usually means change, changing the future, coming of
a new age; entil-zha is the one who creates or guides the forces
creating the future; and z'ha'dum (with the broken zha) is the death of
the future, or the dark future.

      And yes, Kosh and Ulkesh were contemporaries, though Ulkesh was
the more military of the two, very isolationist, while Kosh was the
curious one, interested in the younger races, and more willing to
extend himself (with sometimes unfortunate results).  Kosh always
worried what Ulkesh would do without his moderating presence...and
ultimately had to be the one to take him down to allow the younger
races to step forward.

                                                                  jms
