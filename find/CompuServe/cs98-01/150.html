<pre> Koslosky &lt;102365.2062@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; He asked - if a telepath walked into a bathroom and someone was
&gt; "hidden" behind a shower curtain, could that telepath do anything
&gt; to that person?

      Depends on the strength of the telepath.

                                                                  jms
