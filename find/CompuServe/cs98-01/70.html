<H2>Centauri... REPUBLIC??</H2>
<h3>Date: 11 Jan 1998 00:34:06 -0700</h3>
<pre> Pat Frank &lt;102016.1015@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Why chose the word "republic" if it isn't one?

      Why call the United States a democracy when it's a republic?

      You must understand that there is always some difference between
what a country calls itself, and what it actually is...further, though
the Centauri Republic may have been more of a republic than it is now,
it almost certainly wouldn't change thousands of years of history books
just to accommodate a slight shift in direction.  No matter what form
its government takes, it will always call itself the Centauri Republic,
because that's their whole identity, their history.  We lie to
ourselves all the time...that's what most governments are built on.

                                                                  jms
