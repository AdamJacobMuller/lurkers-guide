<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Londo's "What do you want?"
&gt; Is it possible he would've been firmer with the Captain about the
&gt; orders to avoid contact they had received, and that the entire
&gt; incident and thus the war might've been avoided? At what age do
&gt; Centauri boys have their hair start to stick up? How do they know
&gt; this? Do they have additional information they're not mentioning
&gt; about Minbari war strategy? Are they just guessing?
&gt; Or are they just making it all up as propaganda, thinking that it
&gt; will motivate the Earth Forces to fight harder?

      Londo's first wife was a dancer, who he was forced to divorce by
his family.

      Adira reminds him of her a lot.
