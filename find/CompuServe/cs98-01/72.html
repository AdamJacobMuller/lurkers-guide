<H2>Missing Hour?</H2>
<h3>Date: 11 Jan 1998 00:26:06 -0700</h3>
<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;75063.3305@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; So what I'm asking here is, which is correct?
&gt; The episode or the movie?
&gt; Or can both be correct?
&gt; Did Londo call them before the hour was up?
&gt; Was he referring to other prisoners?

      We're really only talking about an hour's distinction
here...time is fluid in dramatic terms.  (How many times have we seen a
bomb timer showing 3 minutes, and the process of defusing the bomb
takes 15?)

                                                                  jms
