<pre> Carl Cantarella &lt;105030.3700@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; How about the title of the episode, Joe?
&gt; Any reason other than the theme which might have prompted your
&gt; choosing it?

      I picked "No Compromises" because that was my approach for this
season: we aren't going to give an inch on the quality of the show.

                                                                  jms
