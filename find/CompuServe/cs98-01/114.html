<pre> Lennier &lt;101671.630@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Where did they see it?
&gt; Will there be a movie clip of it uploaded onto this forum?

      You can find the clip at the tnt site,
www.tnt.turner.com/babylon5, or you can watch it tonight.

                                                                  jms
