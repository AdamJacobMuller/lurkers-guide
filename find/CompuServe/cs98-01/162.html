"This was unfair to the B5 brass and said no. CC was in England
promoting the show, the time-limit on the contract signing passed, and
she was fired and replaced."

      Just to clarify...since she had declined to sign the same
extension the rest of the cast signed, she was no longer working for B5
at that time, and hadn't been for over a month.  You can't fire someone
who isn't working for you.  All WB could do was make an offer, which
she could accept or not.

                                                                  jms
