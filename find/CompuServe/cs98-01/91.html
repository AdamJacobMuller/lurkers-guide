<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;75063.3305@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; And was that your name I saw painted on the butt of the station
&gt; as if it were a great big bumper sticker?

      Thanks...yeah, this in some ways is my favorite title sequence. 
It took a long time to make it, and it was very difficult to assemble. 
Usually I can design the title sequence on paper, and the working with
the editors part doesn't take that long...here it took a Long Time to
painstakingly choose the images, use counterpoint dialogue, pick the
high moments and make it all flow from one year to the next, sort of a
Cliff's Notes version of the history of the show.  And the music is
terrific...very mature, solid sounding.

      As for the back of the station...y'know, those damn taggers are
everywhere, aren't they?

                                                                  jms
