<pre> Catherine Becic &lt;73414.2603@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Q: With the rebroadcast of S1-4 on TNT, how will you handle NEW
&gt; fans who suddenly want to ask you all the same questions we've
&gt; been asking you through the first runs? Will you repeat yourself,
&gt; keep a lower profile and send them to review the Lurker's Guide,
&gt; what? Is The Gatherine still scheduled for right after In The
&gt; Beginning?

      Yes, the Gathering will be aired after In the Beginning.  I
think they'll run the Guide again in-between, though.

      I'll deal with the new fans as I have with the old timers...with
as much courtesy as I can, because I owe them no less.  One thing that
*would* help is if people continue what they've been doing, and if a
question comes up where the answer is known, or the questioner can be
pointed to a faq, if they can continue to dive in and point the person
to the relevant info, thus saving me the effort, that would be
wonderful as well.

                                                                  jms
