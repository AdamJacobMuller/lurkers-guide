<pre> SysOp_Dupa_T_Parrot &lt;70040.104@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Did you catch any of the classic Twilight Zone shows on the SciFi
&gt; Channel's TZ marathon?

      I saw some of it, was working most of the time.  They did shoot
a few select shows on videotape, as an experiment, which they later
dropped.

                                                                  jms
