<h3>Date: 29 Jan 1998 02:03:14 -0700</h3>
<pre> Kevin Kenney &lt;104102.352@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Can you have someone check and clarify this?
&gt; Quickies: G'Kar's replacement eye: this wasn't because of Andreas
&gt; starting to have problems with the contacts, was it? Will Lockley
&gt; or anyone that stayed loyal to Clark ever answer the question
&gt; about what they expected to happen to Clark? Or was Edgar's
&gt; description all we'll get? Perhaps the answer is too simple to
&gt; relate: they thought it would clear up somehow, and just didn't
&gt; want to get involved themselves...?

      No, the contact omission was kept because of the story and the
character; it'll be dealt with down the line in more detail, but for
now, that's why it's there.

                                                                  jms
