<pre> Frank McCloy &lt;74541.3464@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Hmmm, They must have ironclad contracts, hey?

"I, for one, would like to see the Ivanova character return.  I don't
know if it's possible, but I would still like to see it."

      a) Wasn't my decision, b) given that I'm writing 522 right now,
I'd say that the odds are zero, barring "Sleeping in Light," shot last
year and held over to this one.

                                                                  jms
