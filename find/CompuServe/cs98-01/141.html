<pre> Philip Hornsey &lt;74053.2101@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Speaking of Narns, what is G'Kar's position now?
&gt; Has the Ka'Ri been reestablished?
&gt; Is he finally First Circle?

      A lot of that will be established this season, but technically,
he's still the Ambassador from Narn.
                                                                  jms
