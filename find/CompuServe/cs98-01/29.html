      We got the ratings, and I can't release them yet, that has to
come from TNT, but suffice to say they're dancing in the aisles over at
TNT.  Again, I can't give specifics yet, but they had a very specific
rating in mind that they felt was the best we would probaby get, which
we beat handily, and they felt that the pilot, being a rerun, wouldn't
do that well...and it ended up doing as well as the maximum they'd
hoped the prequel would get.

      They're stunned.

                                                                  jms
