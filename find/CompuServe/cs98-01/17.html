      Thanks....

"I know you probably couldn't have made a movie about the
Earth-Minbari War without giving away the ending, but I was kind of
hoping the details would be left more vague than they were for the
benefit of new viewers."

      I came to that part of my decision-making process, and realized
that in 2, 5 or 10 years, the secret ain't gonna be secret anymore...so
why not play into that, and make the audience aware up front, which
adds a different kind of tension, like seeing the bomb under the table
when the characters eating dinner don't know it's there.

                                                                  jms
