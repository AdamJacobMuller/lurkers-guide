<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; You're a hell of a storyteller; what made you choose television
&gt; as the medium?

      I picked TV because this sort of saga has been *done* for print
before, but nobody's done it for TV in the US before.  It's more of a
challenge to do it here.

                                                                  jms
