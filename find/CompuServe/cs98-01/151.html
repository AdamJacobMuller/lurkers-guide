<pre> Koslosky &lt;102365.2062@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; morden visits Delenn, what was that glowing triangle?
&gt; Morden?
&gt; Regarding TKO, he grabbed me in the office the day after it aired
&gt; and asked, "What's with the "Bloodsport" rip off (the movie with
&gt; Jeanne Claude von Damme)?

"In SaP, when Mr. morden visits Delenn, what was that glowing
triangle?  He thinks he recalls also seeing it in ItB and he thinks it
has something to do with the Triluminary, but he hasn't  seen it since.
What did it mean in the case of Mr. Morden?"

      It's something the Grey Council have that allows them to sense
the arrival of the Shadows and their minions.

"Regarding TKO, he grabbed me in the office the day after it aired and
asked, "What's with the "Bloodsport" rip off (the movie with Jeanne
Claude von Damme)?  I didn't care and thought it was well done but I
told him I'd ask you on his behalf."

      Dunno...didn't write it.
