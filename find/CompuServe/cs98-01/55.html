<pre> Philip Hornsey &lt;74053.2101@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Were they friends?

      No, I wouldn't call them friends.  They had a certain respect
for one another, but Ulkesh always thought Kosh was soft, and Kosh
always worried that Ulkesh was dangerous.  In their own ways, both were
right.

                                                                  jms
