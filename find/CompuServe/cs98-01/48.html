<pre> Philip Hornsey &lt;74053.2101@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Did Kosh set the Vorlons *and* the Shadows up?
&gt; Was he sick of the conflict and so arranged events, that he was
&gt; *certain* that the outcome would be a final end to it all?

      You're right, as far as it goes...I think Kosh came late to the
table. I don't think he came to B5 with that intent, but it grew in him
over time that this cycle had to end, and he could be instrumental to
that.

                                                                  jms
