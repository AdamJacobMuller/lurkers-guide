"That would be the only place they would fit, but then I wonder why a
Grey Council member would blast Sinclair after they already know he has
Valen's soul."

      Remember that Sinclair was going for them at that moment, and
the blast didn't hurt him, only knocked him out...they were
deliberately *not* trying to hurt him.

                                                                  jms
