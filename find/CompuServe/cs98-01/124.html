<pre> Dave Latorre &lt;76172.473@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Was it difficult to find these characters in the casting line?
&gt; What lead you to make these important choices?

      When they came in the door, they *were* those characters as they
read the script.  It was a no-brainer.

                                                                  jms
