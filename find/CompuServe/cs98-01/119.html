<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; After seeing the Signs and Portents rerun tonight, we see Lochley
&gt; ask *the* question of Byron - "What do you want?" Had we ever seen
&gt; what a Gaim looked like without the mask before? Will the "public"
&gt; ever find out that the entire oath of office taken by Sheridan
&gt; was "Put your hand on the book and say 'I do'"? We now know that
&gt; Sheridan washes his own socks, but we still don't know the real
&gt; issue -- sock sock shoe shoe or sock shoe sock shoe?

"Does anyone know whether Byron's "The geometries that circumscribe
your waking life draw narrower until nothing fits inside them anymore"
came from anywhere. My first (rather obvious) guess was that it was a
line from Byron."

      No, that was me.
