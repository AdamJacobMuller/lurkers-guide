<pre> Roseann M. Caputo &lt;103510.1542@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; What are the particulars for choosing the art for the books?
&gt; Who could she send her portfolio to?

      The book is being done in-house through WB publishing, so it'd
have to go through that.

      And thanks...good to see you there.

                                                                  jms
