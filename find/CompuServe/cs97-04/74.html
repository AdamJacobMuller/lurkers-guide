      It ain't a ST series, it's a different show entirely.

      Came out of Majel's vault, and apparently they're going to have
to change the name to avoid any conflicts with Scientology and
Battlefield Earth.

      They'd asked if I'd be interested in running it, but I declined.
I think they've now got Rick Okie, from Renegade, on as
show-runner/writer basing the series on the provided material.

                                                                  jms
