<pre> Jean S McKnight &lt;105513.130@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; What sort of mutant keyboard is that?
&gt; Is it wireless?
&gt; Would you recommend this arrangement for those of us with the CTS
&gt; and sore neck blues?

      That's a Kinesis keyboard, which I've found very useful.  It's
cut back the discomfort quite a bit, and I recommend it, though it
takes a bit to get used to it.

      I've also just ordered a Datahand, which is a very radically
different design, though there's apparently an 8 week waiting list. 
I'll let folks know how that one works out.

                                                                  jms
