<pre> Eric Baker &lt;76600.2605@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; If I recall correctly, didn't you change casting directors
&gt; between the first and second seasons and wasn't one of the
&gt; reasons an effort to get more "cultural diversity" into the
&gt; casting?

      Yes, there we noticed a lapse because the show was getting (and
still tends to be) a little too white-bread for my tastes, though we've
gotten a bit better lately.

                                                                  jms
