<pre> Francis Rogers &lt;73742.1613@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; BTW, do you know if Kitman was putting us on in his overlong
&gt; introduction? What are your actual feelins on the matter?
&gt; 4, Who played the "psychiatrist" in the episode, the one
&gt; interviewed by Randall?

      I am definitely *not* anti-reporter...I'm against the *control*
of truth by any government or political agenda.  We are made stronger
by a multiplicity of voices, and the more those voices are allowed
access to a level playing field, the more often the truth will come out
to play.

      The third name was Jarrico, after Paul Jarrico, also
blacklisted.

                                                                  jms
