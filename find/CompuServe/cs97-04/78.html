<H2>B5 Fan Club Note (jms)</H2>
<h3>Date: 28 Apr 1997 00:52:04 -0700</h3>
<pre>      One of the most dangerous things in the world is a writer who
has finished writing for a while, has met his deadlines, and can now
address other issues.

      One such issue that has been nibbling at the back of my
brainstem has been the Babylon 5 Fan Club.  I've felt for some time
that it was not living up to its potential, and has been laying fallow
for some while.  The Universe Today newsletter was okay, but it could
have been better.  The club was okay, but could have been better.

      Okay is never sufficient.  We either move forward or we fall
back, there is no such thing as holding position.  Especially with the
fan club, because as a fan myself, I have to feel that people are
getting their money's worth out of the club, and frankly, I'm not sure
they have been.  Now that I have time to turn my attention to the
problem....

      A number of changes have been made to improve the situation for
the current members, and for future members.

      1) We are going to substantially improve Universe Today and get
it out on schedule.  To facilitate this, we are announcing that Mike
Zmuda, publisher of the Centaurian Sentinel, probably the best of the
B5 fanzines out there, has been made editor of the newsletter.

      Sandra Bruckner, publisher of the Zocalo, has been named
co-editor. Both begin work effective May 1st.

      Knowing the great work these two have performed individually, we
have every anticipation that their combined efforts on Universe Today
will make it the sort of publication we've always wanted it to be.

      2) Sandra has also agreed to take over as website administrator
for thestation.com, maintaining it and improving it and updating it as
circumstances warrant.  The B5 Fan Club Web Site has also been
wandering a bit, and this will correct that problem.

      3) Jim Lockett, founding head of the B5 Fan Club, has moved on
to other projects, and we wish him all the best in his future
endeavors.

      4) A more assertive position will be taken in promoting the club
at conventions, in advertisements, and in developing merchandise
specific to the fan club.

      5) Finally, because of my sense that the members of the Fan Club
have not gotten all that they could have out of the club during its
debut, we are going to ROLL OVER ALL YEAR ONE MEMBERSHIPS to a second
year.  If you joined prior to April 1, 1997, you are automatically
comp'd in as a member for a second year without charge.  Doug and I
will personally swallow the expense of that.

      It is our desire that the Official Babylon 5 Fan Club should be
the best entity of its kind ever created.  Now that we have made some
mid-course corrections, we are back on track to becoming that.  And we
think you will approve of our plans for improving and expanding the
operation as we move ahead over the rest of 1997.
