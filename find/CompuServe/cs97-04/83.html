<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;75063.3305@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Well, your directorial debut should be over now, right?
&gt; So, how did it go?
&gt; Or how is it going, if you're still doing it?
&gt; Any cute stories or other interesting happening (no spoilers,
&gt; obviously)? And, above all, did everyone cry?

       I'm only on day 2 so far...long way to go yet before I can
rest.

                                                                  jms
