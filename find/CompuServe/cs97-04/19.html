      No, I was not told that people had left the line and not been
allowed in.  At one point, a security person pointed to the end of the
line and told me that now that we'd begun that would be the end of it,
but that's all. (And I kept insisting that I'd sign more than one
thing, I'm real fast that way.) I felt that they were a little
ham-handed in this...but at the same time, particulary Sunday, I was on
a *very* tight schedule, and that made things tough for everyone.  But
my policy holds: if someone's in line, they should get an autograph, no
matter how long it takes.
