<H2>Hugo Ballot Announced!</H2>

<pre> David Gerrold &lt;70307.544@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Comments anyone?

       David...I agree with you completely.  I find the cavalier
treatment you've received on this to be appalling in the extreme. 
Everyone who saw that episode knows full well that it used massive
amounts of your material: your writing, your lines, your ideas, your
structure...it's all there.  The new stuff is just interwoven into it. 
That you aren't listed as one of the writers, that they never even
*paid* you for the use of your material is nothing short of hideous.

                                                                  jms
