<pre> Catherine Becic &lt;73414.2603@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; for your version that is used by the Vorlons, are they based on a
&gt; concept from another area of SF that I'm not familiar with? or did
&gt; you come up with them yourself? did you know that the US was
&gt; developing them?

       No, that's something that we came up with here...if this is
true, it's an interesting concept.

                                                                  jms
