<H2>Does all Earth use EST?</H2>
<h3>Date: 17 Apr 1997 22:53:08 -0700</h3>
<pre> Marcia Sampson &lt;103127.1072@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; That got me to wondering: is the entire planet Earth on Earth
&gt; Standard Time? If the whole Earth is on Earth Standard Time, does
&gt; this mean that in places well away from the EST meridian, most
&gt; people work at night and sleep/observe curfew during daylight?

      No, EST is mainly for the seat of government, to which most
military outposts are synchronized.

                                                                  jms
