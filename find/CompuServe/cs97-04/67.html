<H2>Hugo Ballot Announced!</H2>

<pre>{original post had no questions}

      Too bad no one's considered the idea that the Hugo here could be
viewed in another way.  That is...the DS9 episode was really a tribute
to the original "Tribbles" episode.  That was the whole reason they
*did* it, and the plot ties directly into that original episode.  If
you take away the original "Tribbles" script...there's nothing *there*.
They just weave in and out of your story.

      So if the DS9 episode is a tribute to your episode, then why
couldn't the Hugo be given *to the original episode*?  After all, it
was good enough for DS9 to pay tribute to, and in essence, simply
repackage it...why not follow in their footsteps and their intention?

                                                                  jms
