<H2>Hugo News?</H2>
<h3>Date: 18 Apr 1997 23:56:25 -0700</h3>
<pre> SysOp Dupa T Parrot &lt;70040.104@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; So, have you any news to leak to us?

      Well, if there *were* anything to say, it would be with the
understanding that the Hugo people want to make the announcements on
nominations, so anything I have to say wouldn't actually exist until
after then, so what I might have to say now doesn't exist, and what I
may say in future can't be said, so theoretically what exists, doesn't,
for the immediate future.

                                                                  jms
