<pre>      To anyone one the Psi Phi mailing list or web site: someone has
been logging on to impersonate me over this past weekend.  I have
never, at any time, posted on this site, and any messages are to be
discounted, deleted and ignored.  If anyone knows the sysop of this
system, please notify them and tell them to remove that account.

      There have been, and continue to be, impersonators using my name
on other systems.  If you see something that looks suspicious, or if I
show up on an unfamiliar system, please send email to me asking if it's
actually me or not.  Generally the only places I post *ever* are
Compuserve, GEnie, AOL, the usenet moderated group, and the B5 fan club
site.

      To those considering this prank: understand that whereas other
activities are fuzzy under the law when it comes to the cyberworld,
falsy impersonating someone is *not*, and you will be arrested.  Count
on it.

                                                                  jms
