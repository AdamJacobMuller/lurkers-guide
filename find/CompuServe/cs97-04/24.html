<H2>Who Killed JMS?</H2>
<h3>Date: 08 Mar 1997 21:25:54 -0700</h3>
<pre> JOHN GRAVES &lt;102735.1124@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Just what the heck is going on?
&gt; What are you folks thinking of?

      As I noted in a message to you in another thread, everything has
worked out fine, and the sysops have adjusted the structure to allow
for greater flexibility, for which they are to be commended.

      So I'm still alive and well and here...the reports of my dearth
are greatly exaggerated....

                                                                  jms
