<pre> Jean S McKnight &lt;105513.130@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Not to belabor this line of questioning (she says as she
&gt; belabors), but where do you get one of these things?

      Unfortunately, I don't remember where I got it, and the label
has long since fallen off, I only remember that it was called a LapCat.

                                                                  jms
