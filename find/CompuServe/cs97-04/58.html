<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;75063.3305@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; And why do I have the feeling that, in a society with a declining
&gt; population, one of the last rituals before marriage may well be a
&gt; test of fertility? But we'll have to wait and see, won't we?

      I like silly and unbecoming as long as it's believable...which
is a fine line to walk.  We all do silly things from time to time, and
that's okay.

                                                                  jms
