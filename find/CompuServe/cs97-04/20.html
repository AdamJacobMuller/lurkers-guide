<H2>Thanks, &amp; some questions</H2>

<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Was it your idea to have Marcus singing "I am the Very Model of a
&gt; Moder Major General" at the end of the last episode, or was it
&gt; the actor who suggested the specific song? Why has no one begun to
&gt; put two and two together and think about the possibility that
&gt; Garibaldi's change in personality may be related to the fact that
&gt; he he and his ship were obviously abducted?

       The song was in the script; Jason then had to learn it.  And
Andreas came in and auditioned like others, and we responded to what we
saw during his audition.  Simple as that.

       And thanks....
