<pre> Michael Beemer &lt;71551.1670@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; What gives?

      They would be a *major* disruption in an environment such as B5,
so their presence is discouraged in the sense of having an office
there, though other teeps do pass through on occasion.

                                                                  jms
