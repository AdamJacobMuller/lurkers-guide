<pre> colin heaps &lt;100622.3610@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; If word of renewal is late, is it likely that the finale may have
&gt; to be filmed 'just in case' - and if so - how do the cast feel
&gt; about that? For once, knowing the outcome, how would it affect
&gt; their actions for the characters?
&gt;  - Yeah I know - big stretch on my part, again, what do I know??
&gt; Last thing - my wife came up with a dandy idea - if there is no
&gt; season 5 - how about WB extending S4 so Joe has a couple of
&gt; episodes to tie things up - instead of condensing it into one ??
&gt;  - Freeing him up for more "expression" - Good idea (if unlikely)
&gt; or wot (or not )?? Thoughts people ??
&gt; Please ??

       Ain't nobody gonna be disappointed.  That much I feel sure
about.
