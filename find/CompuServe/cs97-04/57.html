<pre> Rebecca Eschliman &lt;76072.2345@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Page 125 - "What did it mean--so many cowboys and Indians in
&gt; outer space, so many SWAT teams and drug-busters, and such a foam
&gt; and froth of humanoid diversity?

       Thanks for taking the time to transcribe all that.  I figured
just a synopsis, but you went far beyond the line of duty on that. 
Many thanks again.
