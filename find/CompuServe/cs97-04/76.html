      No, but that (the vorlon question) is a philosophical issue. 
You hardly ever run into problems there...what kills you is doctrine,
based on a belief. If it weren't for doctrine, a lot of the world's
religions would get along a lot better, because the core roots of their
beliefs aren't that dissimilar, it's the interpretation and the rules
that grew up around them that seem to cause all the trouble.

                                                                  jms
