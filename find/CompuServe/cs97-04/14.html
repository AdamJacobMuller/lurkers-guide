<H2>B5 Fans vs. Trekkies</H2>
<h3>Date: 08 Apr 1997 01:48:12 -0700</h3>
<pre> Kevin P. Kenney &lt;104102.352@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Where is the line drawn?
&gt; How do we stay 'healthy' fans, and avoid getting mentioned in the
&gt; next update of Harlan's Xenogenesis?

      Leaving aside the whole broader questions at work here -- and
there are many -- I think that on balance, B5 fans would have a harder
time falling for this sort of thing in general because B5 does not
offer answers, only questions, and encourages viewers to think for
themselves and question authority.  This would not make them good
candidates for cult recruitment drives.

                                                                  jms
