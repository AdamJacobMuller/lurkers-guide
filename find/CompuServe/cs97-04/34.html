<pre> Jean S McKnight &lt;105513.130@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; What do you do for a mouse, though?
&gt; And how DO you handle the keyboard in your lap- do you have an
&gt; extra long cord, or a cordless adapter?

      I still have to use a standard mouse, though I hate a mousepad,
so I usually just run it on the top of my leg.

      The keyboard cable is pretty standard, and should probably be
longer. I just keep it in my lap, on a lap-cat (a keyboard cushion),
and sit back and type my little brains out.

                                                                  jms
