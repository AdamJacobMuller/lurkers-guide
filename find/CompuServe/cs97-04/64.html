&gt; And to know how pervasive those icky shadow minions seem to be
&gt; (guess we'll learn more about them next week)...We saw the
&gt; episode on vacation and can you believe that at times I felt
&gt; anxious, wondering what could be bothering me, only to realize I
&gt; was worried about John, Delenn, Garibaldi and Babylon5?

       Thanks...unsettled is just the right reaction.  And yeah,
someone is going to start wondering soon enough about his behavior.

                                                                  jms
