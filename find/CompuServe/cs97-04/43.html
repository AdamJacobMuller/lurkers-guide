<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;75063.3305@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; So my question is: Is the placement of this story in error, or is
&gt; the characterization just really out of sync with the series? Or
&gt; is this criticism entirely unjustified from your point of view?

      No, I've said that while this one is okay, the characterization
is off, and it tries 'way too hard to be funny, ignoring the notion
that if everything is funny then *nothing* is funny.  Unfortunately, I
didn't get the actual manuscript until it was too late to do anything
short of commissioning a full rewrite, which they wouldn't do.

      Anyway...as I said, it's okay.  But for my money, the Anna
Sheridan and Jeffrey Sinclair books are the two real gems of this
batch.

                                                                  jms
