<H2>ATTN JMS: Blacklists?</H2>
<h3>Date: 16 Apr 1997 01:17:13 -0700</h3>
<pre> Thomas Rackers &lt;72047.1207@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Basically, were some actors who were blacklisted by the HUAC
&gt; proceedings able to find work afterwards under other names? Are
&gt; you aware if pseudonyms were used to get around the blacklists?

      Some writers were able to get around it, but not the actors,
except by leaving the US and working in England or Paris.  I think
you're thinking of two different actors.

                                                                  jms
