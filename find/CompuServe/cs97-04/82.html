<pre> Brian Prothero &lt;76711.663@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; or were you just too busy with your current projects?
&gt; Did the story idea for Battleground Earth sound promising?

       Thanks.  It was noted to me at the time that a
Roddenberry/Straczynski collaboration would be very commerical, but on
looking at the material, I just felt it wasn't strong enough; at least,
I couldn't see where it could go, and thus felt it better to leave it
to others who potentially would not be limited by that, and could find
ways to make it work.

                                                                  jms
