<pre> Philip Hornsey &lt;74053.2101@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; One question this brings to mind, why do we never see anything
&gt; but ISN? How did ISN get a stranglehold on the news, and if it
&gt; didn't, then there are likely millions of potential news outlets
&gt; accessible to everyone, how does Clark keep them under control?

       ISN is the one network that can handle *interstellar*
broadcasts, which reqire a massive amount of energy, logistics,
setup...there are other, local, planetary networks around Earth, and a
few specialized channels for military and some commercial use...but ISN
is the biggest, and because of that is very much in Earthgov's pocket.

                                                                  jms
