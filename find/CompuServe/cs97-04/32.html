<pre> Eric Baker &lt;76600.2605@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; 8) What I'm curious about is if you have given any thought to the
&gt; male/female ratio on the new show? Have you given any thought to
&gt; it?

      I never ever give thought to ratios, or making a political
statement, or anything other than the story.  If that meant using 100%
female cast in the movie, or 100% male cast, or some variation thereof,
then that's what it'll be.  I think the *instant* you start putting
agendas ahead of the creative process, of saying "What is the story
*about*?" then I think you're dead.

                                                                  jms
