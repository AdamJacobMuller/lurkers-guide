<pre> Craig M. Bobchin &lt;102354.3246@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; What was the timing of the book/episode?
&gt; I know books require a bit of lead time so did the author see the
&gt; episode before it aired or was it something you added after the
&gt; book was in progress?

      It all just sorta came together at the same time.

                                                                  jms
