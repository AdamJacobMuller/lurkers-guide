<pre> Jean S McKnight &lt;105513.130@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; though then what would my excuse for getting so little done be?

      BTW, before I forget, try checking out www.datahand.com for
another kind of keyboard, the one I just ordered.  Can't vouch for it
yet, because I haven't tried it and am trying this on faith, but it's a
completely radical new design that was initially made for the Post
Office, and is now being sold commercially.

                                                                  jms
