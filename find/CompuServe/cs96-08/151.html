<pre> Rebecca Eschliman &lt;76072.2345@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; But have they ever given you any justification for their
&gt; scheduling?

       It's all a matter of running new eps during sweeps.

       What's interesting -- when some fans of ST shows look for
something to badrap B5 about, using the ST ratings as a bludgeon -- the
ST ratings have been consistently sliding.  For the last several
quarters, the quarterly rating on DS9 has gone from 7.1 to 6.7, 5.9 and
as of July 4.6.

       B5's ratings per quarter have gone from 2.7 to 2.9, 3.0 and
3.1.  Why do I bring this up?  Because lately, in reruns, DS9 hit a 3.9
rating for the first time in reruns that I can think of (usually
they're in the 4s or low 5s) at about the same time we hit a 3.1 in
reruns, where usually it's a bit lower. So now there's only .8 between
us and DS9 in reruns, where the gap used to be huge.  So it should be
*very* interesting to see what happens when new episodes hit the air. 
I imagine they'll still be ahead, but the gap will, I suspect, be much
smaller.

                                                                  jms
