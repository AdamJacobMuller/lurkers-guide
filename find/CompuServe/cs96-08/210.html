       Nope.  Those were some of the folks we were considering.  We
also looked in the direction of Bruce Campbell (who had just had his
show shot out from under him, and whose agent said he wasn't doing TV
for a while) and several others.  Basically, you look around for who's
available, who might be good for the role, might bring something
interesting to it...and then pick the best person.

                                                                  jms
