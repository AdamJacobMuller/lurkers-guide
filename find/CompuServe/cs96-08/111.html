<H2>Season 4 Title?</H2>
<h3>Date: 15 Aug 1996 23:52:26 -0700</h3>
<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Have you announced the overall title for season 4 yet?
&gt; If so, can you share it with us?
&gt; Have you begun filming the next season yet?
&gt; And how's the writing coming along?

      When I can announce the overall year 4 title, I will.  Filming
starts August 26th.  The writing is coming well.  Actually walked the
sets today for the first time since we wrapped in May; it's just too
depressing to walk on a dead set.  Lots of work going on now, new sets
being built, noise and energy and enthusiasm...much better now.

                                                                  jms
