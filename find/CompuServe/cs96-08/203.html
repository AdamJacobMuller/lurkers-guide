<pre> Jonathan Kass &lt;74130.443@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; once the email address was published, someone should have been
&gt; ready to respond (why else publish it?

       Lemme ask you a question...did your check get cashed?  Because
I just went down the hall and asked Jim what the status was on Jonathan
Kass' membership, and it wasn't in any of the files, so what I'm
wondering is if it just never got to us.

                                                                  jms
