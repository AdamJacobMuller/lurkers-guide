<pre> Simon Pallett &lt;101523.507@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Do you, however, also think that once we find out what the
&gt; Shadows want, we shall agree that the methods by which they go
&gt; about it are justifiable? To put it another way, is the manner in
&gt; which the Shadows are attempting to achieve their objective the
&gt; only way in which they can do so, or is there another method they
&gt; could have chosen?

       I don't think we'll find the methods appealing, but the motives
behind it may have some justification.

                                                                  jms
