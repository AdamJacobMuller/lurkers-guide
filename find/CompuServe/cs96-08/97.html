      Bringing actors in and out, and changing their characters, is
more or less always a story issue, so it's never a problem.  Londo,
which you mention, was always intended to go on his arc from comic
relief to something darker and more tragic.  That's his story; it was
his story long before any actors were ever hired.

                                                                  jms
