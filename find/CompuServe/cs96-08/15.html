<pre> Martin Shaw &lt;101642.505@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Have we only reached the tip of the Iceburg of despair?

       There's always light at the end of the tunnel...but things have
got to get REALLY bad first, there has to be some major stuff for
everyone to overcome to make the light mean something.

                                                                  jms
