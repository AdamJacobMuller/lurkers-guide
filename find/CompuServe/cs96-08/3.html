<pre> Jeff Smith &lt;76702.2572@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; This would certainly explain why a lot of info is 'missing' that
&gt; one might think should be around, but why didn't the info
&gt; survive? If the Vorlons/Minbari fought the shadows a thousand
&gt; years ago, and had the FTL ships they obviously had, why don't
&gt; they have records from that time?

       It was also a very devastating war, and one of their mistakes
was that their were those who were entrusted to keep the past, sort of
a more advanced version of storytellers, who put all their data in one
basket, as it were...very possessive and jurisdictional.  When they and
that center of data were taken out, a lot was lost.  One drawback of a
very rigid and structued society.

                                                                  jms
