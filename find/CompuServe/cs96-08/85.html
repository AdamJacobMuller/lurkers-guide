      Red Five is not from Star Wars...it's standard Air Force
designation on various teams, Red One, Blue Three, others in some
cases, Alpha One, Bravo Two in others.  People in and out of the
military have been color coding fighters and the like long, long before
there was a Star Wars.  There's a danger in assuming that the first
place you heard it was the place that invented it. There are some ST
fans who *insist* that ST invented the term tachyon, since that's where
they heard it first, and even have given me and other shows a hard time
when we use this actual scientific notion.
