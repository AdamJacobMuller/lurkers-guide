<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; There are a few little bits, like the repaired time stabliser
&gt; that The One gets from Zathros (in Babylon Squared), that's
&gt; Sheridan's isn't it? Did you sit down and write these episodes at
&gt; the same time?

      Actually, that would've been Delenn who finally got the repaired
time stabalizer.  And no, I didn't write them at the same time, but I
did a basic outline of what the follow-up (WWE) would be, so it'd all
match up when the time came to show that half of the story.

                                                                  jms
