<pre> Batman &lt;104635.1044@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Do they skip over those and just release 418, or do they reprint
&gt; them?????

"Think of how annoying it will be, in ten years time, when this stuff
will be a valuable collector's item, and having to explain that there
was never any issues 1-4, THEY STARTED ON 5!!!!!!"

      That's *exactly* what I was thinking of....

                                                                  jms
