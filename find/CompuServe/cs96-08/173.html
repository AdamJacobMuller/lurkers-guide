<pre> Scott Miller &lt;70562.3656@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Wouldn't this image have been worth mentioning?

       Watch the scene again; the first time the new Vorlon looks at
the wall, he sees nothing; the next time he looks at it, the lens wide
open, the image is somewhat distorted around the edges, and now he's
seeing the afterflash. Only certain types can see it.

                                                                  jms
