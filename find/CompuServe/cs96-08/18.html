<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; I hate to be a bother, but could you explain some stuff to me?
&gt; What is the relation of these episodes to each other?

       It'd be hard to explain in a few paragraphs...may I commend to
you the lurker's guide on the internet: http://hyperion.com, which will
bring you wonderfully up to speed.

                                                                  jms
