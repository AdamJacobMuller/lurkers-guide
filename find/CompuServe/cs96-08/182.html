<pre> Michael Grabois &lt;74737.2600@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Do you have any closer idea as to when the end of Season 3 is
&gt; going to be shown in the US besides "sometime in October"?

       Starts the first week of October, straight through.

                                                                  jms
