<H2>Quakers on B5?</H2>
<h3>Date: 27 Aug 1996 14:57:12 -0700</h3>
<pre> Jonathan Hoopingarn &lt;73172.1065@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Now that all the mistaken identities have been cleared up, and as
&gt; the final arbiter of all things Babylonian, would the Quakers
&gt; have made it?

       I don't know...maybe...it's something that I'll have to
consider.

                                                                  jms
