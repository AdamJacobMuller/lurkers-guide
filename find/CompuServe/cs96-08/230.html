<pre> Valerie Williams &lt;104047.2451@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; If you get asked to come back next year, will you?
&gt; Truth to that?
&gt; Any thoughts as to also releasing videos of the episodes?

      Thanks.  To your questions...I haven't yet been invited back to
Marcon (I don't know if they've finalized their list yet), but if that
should happen, work schedule allowing, I would likely be there; and
yes, B5 has been sold to TNT for runs after the show has gone its
course, which will be the first time we'll have had a national timeslot
and a big network.

                                                                  jms
