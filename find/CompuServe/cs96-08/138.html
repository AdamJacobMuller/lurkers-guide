<pre>{original post had no questions}

      I don't suppose I could ask that synopses of the episodes that
are this detailed be kind of not-done?  Brief ones, sure, but a
blow-by-blow breakdown of every scene is rather disheartening to see in
a public forum, even one set aside for spoilers.

                                                                  jms
