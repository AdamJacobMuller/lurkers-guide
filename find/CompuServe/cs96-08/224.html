<pre> William H. DiPaola &lt;76521.1751@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Wait a sec ...you wanted Bruce first???
&gt; Nevertheless, what made you go with O'Hare?
&gt; The two are like night and day for a variety of reasons, and was
&gt; Bruce unavailable initially? How did you learn that he was
&gt; interested in coming aboard?

      Let me clarify, so I won't be misunderstood...Bruce was our
first choice after the change-over from Sinclair.  Bruce would not have
been right for the choice of Sinclair, but was right for Sheridan. 
Michael was right for Sinclair, would not have been right for Sheridan.

                                                                  jms
