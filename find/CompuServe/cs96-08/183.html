<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Did Richard Hatch of Battlestar Galactica read for the part of
&gt; Sheridan?

       Trying to remember...Bruce was our first choice, but we had to
have some backups in case he wasn't available...yeah, we saw Hatch, and
felt he wasn't right for the role, though he's a good actor.  Saw a
bunch of actors, most of whose names have fallen out of my head.

                                                                  jms
