<pre> Laurence Moroney &lt;100546.50@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I thought it quite odd that the availability of such merchandise
&gt; has not been mentioned around here before, which made me wonder
&gt; if it is not fully legitimate...do you have control over such
&gt; things? Before I splash out $120 on a uniform, I would like to
&gt; know if these things are legit?

      If the uniforms are from Janet Lawn, they're legit; no Psi Corps
pins have been approved for anyone at this point.

                                                                  jms
