       There's really no need for propgaganda.  By about now,
everybody out in this part of space knows the situation...and what's
going on back home is secondary to winning the war.  Also, you can be
sure that if they set up a network -- and who has time in the middle of
a war -- you can be sure Earth would find some way to jam it.

                                                                  jms
