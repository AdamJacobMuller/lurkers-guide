      Bear in mind, though, that we're talking Earthforce doctors, who
are part of the military establishment, and we don't know the full
structure of how that exists 200 years from now...certainly if
someone's actions caused the death of 250,000 sentients and a major
Earthforce base, I'd suggest that that could be sufficient grounds for
ending somebody's career....
