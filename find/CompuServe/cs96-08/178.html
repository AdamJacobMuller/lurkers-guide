<pre> Arline Williams &lt;102551.2346@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Or are you guys just shy?

       We're not on the lot.  We couldn't find facilities big enough
for our needs, and if you're on the lot...you're more accessible, and
people have a tendency to wander in and give you notes.  So we're well
off the lot, and nobody bothers us.

                                                                  jms
