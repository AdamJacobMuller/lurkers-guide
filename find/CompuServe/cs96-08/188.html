<H2>B5 FAN CLUB INFO!</H2>
<h3>Date: 24 Aug 1996 00:16:35 -0700</h3>
<pre> Jonathan Kass &lt;74130.443@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Just out of curiousity, how long ago did you get the newsletter?
&gt; last week receiving the kit?

      Jim has sent a public response to the Usenet about the delay,
and the Zocalo has also published a letter from him about it.  In
addition, I've gone at some length here about what's been going on. 
You may not have seen them, but there have been public replies.  The
email list is too hideously huge to reply to individually.  But stacks
and stacks are going out the door as fast as can be.

                                                                  jms
