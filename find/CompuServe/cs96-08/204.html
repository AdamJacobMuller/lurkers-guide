       All of them wanted to work more after ST; very few did, many of
the cast couldn't get arrested.  They deeply resented it.  It's not as
if they said, "oh, well, I'm old now, I can retire."  At the time, most
were in their 40s, with Kelley being the oldest one there.  One doesn't
retire at 40 as an actor; you go on.  They've all talked about it.

                                                                  jms
