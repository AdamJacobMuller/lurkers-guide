       It wasn't that I disliked the responses...most of them were
quite funny in response to my (in jest) offer to come by and see
them...but others said it was kinda mean (mainly in email) and as I
pulled back and looked at it objectively, I saw that it could've
potentially been a UM, and Unintended Meanness.  So I had to rectify
it.  And the only way to do that was to turn the in-jest offer to come
to my office and see them into a real offer.  You gots to do what's
right....
