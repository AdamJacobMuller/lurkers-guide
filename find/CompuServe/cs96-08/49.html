      NO!  NO, no, no, no, no....NO GUESSING ABOUT THE SEQUEL, because
guesses about the sequel is basically putting out reams of story ideas.
If someone comes up with an interesting notion...guess what?  I CAN'T
USE IT BECAUSE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF LAWSUIT.  So this discussion could
kill any hope of doing a sequel along any interesting lines.

      I've already said...the sequel would be built to some degree
around the rangers.  Let it go at that.

                                                                  jms
