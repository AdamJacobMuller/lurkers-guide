<H2>More Vorlon Questions !</H2>
<h3>Date: 13 Aug 1996 21:56:19 -0700</h3>
<pre> Richard Wakefield &lt;100534.504@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Are their different sexes of Vorlon ?
&gt; Do Vorlons have babies, if so...how ?
&gt; How long can the Vorlon keep his Psychic shield up ?
&gt; And how did Kosh get to the Garden, to save Sheridan...did he
&gt; just pass through walls..? And finally, did Vorlons "invent" the
&gt; Angels in the different races ? oh BTW - Is there a technical man
&gt; from B5 on the Net whom I may contact about general tech
&gt; stuff....a tech advisor ?

      Kosh was right there in the garden when Sheridan fell, so that's
how he got there.  And the only tech person on B5 is me.

                                                                  jms
