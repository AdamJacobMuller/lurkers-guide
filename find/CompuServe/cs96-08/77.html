<pre> Brian A. Thomas &lt;75231.1122@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Has there been any plans to start another run of B5 comics?
&gt; Can we expect another one of those anytime soon?

       Several companies are circling around the rights to the B5
comic, and are currently in negotiations.  And after some initial
problems with the contract between WB and Sendai, they hope to begin
putting out more issues of the B5 magazine, yes.

                                                                  jms
