<pre> Richard M. Perry &lt;76461.2737@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; So I guess this means you haven't read the Kingdom Come series
&gt; yet?

      Kingdom Come is about the only comic I've made it a point to get
lately; great stuff.

                                                                  jms
