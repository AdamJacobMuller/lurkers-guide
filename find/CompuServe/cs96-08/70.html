<H2>B5 : Writing is Art?</H2>
<h3>Date: 11 Aug 1996 14:23:46 -0700</h3>
<pre> Juanma Barranquero &lt;100044.2131@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Don't you think there are very few passion those days?

      Passion, as I've noted elsewhere, has become passe.  It's old
fashioned; the proper attitude now seems to be detatchment and
cynicism.  It doesn't help that so much of TV is done by rote,
recycling the same stories from place to place.  Interestingly, I think
we're seeing *less* of that in the last few years than in the entire
decade preceding, so maybe this is a good turn.

                                                                  jms
