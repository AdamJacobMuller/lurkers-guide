"Our great government efficiency at work again!  Do you think THEY
think it's coming FROM Babylon 5?!"

      Dunno about that...but it sure looks to me like the Post Office
is being run by the Shadows.

      (Hmm...I wonder if they saw "Avalon" and are still smarting over
the Post Office humor...?)

                                                                  jms
