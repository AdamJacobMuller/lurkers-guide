<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; any titles?
&gt; is he available in the UK????

       If by "he" you mean Jonathan Carroll...yeah, he's actually
bigger in the UK than the US.  Start with "Bones of the Moon" or "The
Land of Laughs" and take it from there.

                                                                  jms
