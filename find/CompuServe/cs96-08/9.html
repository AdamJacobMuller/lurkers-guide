<pre> Rebecca Eschliman &lt;76072.2345@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Do you find it more of a challenge to write from the perspective
&gt; of one (individual, society) who is less experienced than
&gt; yourself (regain lost innocence) or one who is more experienced
&gt; (project 1,000 to 1,000,000 forward), or is there no difference?

      I don't think there's really a difference.  (Also,
philosophically, I think one can be experienced and still retain a
certain measure of innocence, but that's another discussion for another
time.)  I think we all have that part of ourselves which wishes to
believe, needs to believe in a cause or in other people , however many
times experience slaps us in the face with the contrary position...and
there is always the part which is tired and weary and burned out and
refuses to trust again.  We are all these things at different moments. 
The difference with writers is that we must be those different things
on command, and articulate those feelings through the voices of our 
characters as they experience them in new contexts.

                                                                  jms
