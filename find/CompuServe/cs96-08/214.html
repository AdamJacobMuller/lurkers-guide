<pre>{original post had no questions}

      I went to Jim's office again after your last note, and had him
check the database again by hand; it's definitely not there.  So I've
copied your email to him, and he should be in touch soon, or he'll go
ahead and add it to the list.  It's conceivable that if your check got
caught up in a bundle it might've missed being processed by us.  As far
a I know this is the only time it's happened; but we never know about
it until and unless someone tells us about it.  Thanks for bringing it
to our attention.

                                                                  jms
