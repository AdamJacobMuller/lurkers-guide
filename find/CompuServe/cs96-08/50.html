      I'm definitely looking forward to the reaction.  Today, for
instance, we did the final audio mix of "Z'ha'dum," our third season
ending episode. All of the EFX were in place, the sound, the
music...and after we did the piecemeal mix, layering in things in a
stop-and-go fashion, we did our playback, watching it straight through.
I don't think anyone was breathing for the fourth act.  Everyone was
just wog-boggled.  The emotional impact of it all is quite strong.

      When the lights came up, and I looked around to the stunned
faces in the room, the only thing I could say was, "Welcome to history,
gentlemen."

      Looking forward to reactions?  Oh, yeah, I suppose you could say
that....
