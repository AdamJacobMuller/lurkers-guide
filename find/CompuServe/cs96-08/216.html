      That's the question that's hard to answer, because stuff is
going out the door as fast as possible.  One batch of 1500 went out on
Thursday.  Was yours in there?  I don't know.  Part of the consistent
problem we're having is the Post Office.  They told us what the postage
should be for each packet and newsletter, first class (we sent the
first batches off bulk, and they got dumped, lost, delayed...never
again, we'll just take the loss and deal with it).  So we use that, and
turn it in at the post office.  Depending on which postal worker takes
the parcels, it goes through, or they send them back for more.  So now
we're increasing the postage to make sure they don't do this to us
again.  It's making Jim crazy.
