<pre> Martin Shaw &lt;101642.505@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; But how could you leave Garibaldi in the lurch like that?

      Thanks, the Sinclair material was very moving, I thought.

      As for the kiss...I knew everyone would be waiting for that
first kiss, so I made sure it was different, that it was a first kiss
for one of them, but not the other, that it was natural and totally
unforced and surprising. So for Sheridan, his first kiss of Delenn was
actually his second (by a long ways), and his second, when it comes,
will be her first.

      Just can't do anything the conventional way on this show....

                                                                  jms
