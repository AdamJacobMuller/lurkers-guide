<pre> Rebecca Eschliman &lt;76072.2345@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; And isn't it also possible that journalists skipping their
&gt; browsers across the WWW like stones across a pond will inevitably
&gt; run into "cool" B5 sites, which, again, might direct their focus
&gt; in a more desirable direction?

      I dunno...don't think enough journalists are online yet to make
an impact that way, but who knows?

                                                                  jms
