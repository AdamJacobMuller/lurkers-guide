<pre> Jeff Smith &lt;76702.2572@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; One follow up though, would such an event as described above have
&gt; to occur well after the war to have such an effect, since if
&gt; happened while there where still Minbari alive with personal
&gt; experience in the war the records could still be mostly
&gt; reconstructed?

      Certainly it would've occured in the last days of the war.

                                                                  jms
