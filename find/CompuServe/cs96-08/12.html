<pre> Al Lipscomb &lt;75204.2225@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; The first question that needs to be asked is why did _most_ of
&gt; the first ones leave? Were they tired of thousands of generations
&gt; of war with the Shadows? Tired of this small galaxie?
&gt; Or was there a general agreement to leave this place to the
&gt; Shadows? Could the Shadows be higher levels of natural selection?
&gt; If the clues we have about the death of a Vorlon support Minbari
&gt; theology then what do the Shadows want? What is my bet?

      Some of the first ones just got bored after millions of years,
and went off in general.  The rest, for the most part, went beyond the
Rim for the same reason you cut down old trees to make room for new
ones.

                                                                  jms
