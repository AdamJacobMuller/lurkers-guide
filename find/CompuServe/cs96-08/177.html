<pre> Richard Wakefield &lt;100534.504@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Or, is the *3 day* figure just to get to the "Earth Solar System"
&gt; ? If yes, then what roughly *is* the length of time *in*
&gt; Hyperspace (outside observers) ?

       Three days is the time to the jumpgate off Io.  Once you're
within our solar system, it takes another several days or more to reach
Earth itself. It's fairly common to keep your jump gate a bit removed
from your "core" planet so you have warning if any agressors come out
of it.

                                                                  jms
