<h3>Date: 11 Aug 1996 14:24:02 -0700</h3>
<pre> Neville White &lt;101352.1023@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is this because she knows something about the nature of Vorlons,
&gt; or is it because she knows something of the nature of Shadow
&gt; attacks? Do the shadows consume their victims?

      More about the Vorlons than the shadows.

                                                                  jms
