<pre> SysOp Dupa T Parrot &lt;70040.104@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Did you read the Letters section of next week's TV Guide?

      Yeah, it was great...the "Babylon Edging Out Trek?" column is
quite a bit away from their initial reaction to B5, to wit: "...they
hope will become a series.  Fat chance."

      I have this suspicion people are finally starting to figure out
what we're doing here....

                                                                  jms
