<pre> colin heaps &lt;100622.3610@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; maybe", flattery will get you anywhere eh??
&gt; It goes on, but hey, pretty damn good PR I think nes pas??

       Thanks, I'd seen the article, and it's a great thing.  We're
starting to pick up more positive articles and reviews
lately...basicallly, I think journalists are starting to get past their
preconceptions of what we should be, and what SF is, to see the show
for what it is.

                                                                  jms
