       No reason...just the upload time involved to do it all. 
Anything there can be reposted here.  I keep meaning to do it, but end
up tying up my computer with writing.  The folks at WB do the uploads
to AOL and the WB B5 site; here it'd have to be me, and it's just a
question of finding the time.

                                                                  jms
