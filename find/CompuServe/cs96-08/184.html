       Yes, they do...but bear in mind that the Minbari are currently
having their own problems.  The Grey Council has fallen apart, the
Military Caste (as we'll see in one of the next episodes) is having
some serious doubts about how the Religious Caste is handling things,
and that much of the support given Earth (by way of B5) has been
covert; the White Star program was launched in secret, and the greater
amount of the Minbari population aren't aware they're so much "in bed"
with the humans (as it were).  As far as they're concerned, we're
apparently necessary to the plan, but not much more than that.  So I 
think they wouldn't be warm to the notion of extending their services
overmuch to Earth.

       You keep trying to make everything cut and dried, but in the B5
universe, there ain't no such critter.

                                                                  jms
