      I can't look at ANYthing related to B5 products unless and until
they're licensed; if you're doing these without WB licensing, you're
going to get into a heap o' trouble.  If you're serious about a game,
then you have to get it licensed; otherwise I can't look at it, or I'd
be spending 18 hours a day looking at possible proposals that go
nowhere.

                                                                  jms
