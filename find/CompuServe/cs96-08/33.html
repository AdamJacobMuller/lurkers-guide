<pre> Laurence Moroney &lt;100546.50@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; When lady Morella told Londo not to kill the one that is already
&gt; dead, was she referring to Sheridan? IF this is so, do the words
&gt; of Arkady in "Second Foundation" have significance to Sinclair?

      Unfortunately, I've forgotten what Arkady said, so it's kind of
an open question.

                                                                  jms
