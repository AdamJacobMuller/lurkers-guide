<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; I am curious to know what else is your favourite
&gt; poetry/literature?
&gt;  - but I am interested to know what else it is you like, or has
&gt; influenced you?

       My interest in poetry is fairly eclectic, and eccentric.  I go
from the classics to the obscure, but I'm not *really* as informed
about poetry as I should be.  My favorite stuff comes from the
Shelley/Byron period of English literature.  Tennyson is also obviously
a favorite.  Coleridge.  But then I jump right over into e.e. cummings
and Lawrence Ferlinghetti (no, I never really recovered from beat
poetry, some of it still works for me).  I tend to go for the more
structured poetry; free verse is okay to a point, but often gets
misused or used as an excuse for sloppy writing.
