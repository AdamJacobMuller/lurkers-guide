<pre> Martin Shaw &lt;101642.505@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; The ship that Zathras hooked up to whitestar in looked helluva
&gt; similiar to one of the ships you can get in 'Privateer' - I have
&gt; heard that you are a bit of a Wing Commander buff, was this a
&gt; deliberate homage?

       Nope.  Only coincidence.

                                                                  jms
