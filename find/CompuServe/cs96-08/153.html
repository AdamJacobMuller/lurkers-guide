       "You OWE me an explanation."

       No I don't.

       The series has to stand on its own, for starters, and most of
the questions you've asked here will be addressed by the last episode
of this season.  Suffice to say he has to trust Delenn...he knows she's
been holding back information (even says so later this season), but
until now, has held her in trust, that she must have her reasons.  This
may or may not change soon.

                                                                  jms
