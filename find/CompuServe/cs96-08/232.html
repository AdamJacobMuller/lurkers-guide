       S'okay...that generally happens on the show.  When we brought
in Vir, lots of folks moaned about what a mistake it was, "flounder in
space," they said...same with Walter Koenig...there were any number of
messages suggesting we lose Londo, and others...and after a while, when
they see what we're doing, they turn around.  Vir is now many folks'
favorite character, and Bruce has hit it as Sheridan for most everybody
now.

       Doesn't bother us anymore.

                                                                  jms
