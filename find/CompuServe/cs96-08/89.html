<pre>{original post had no questions}

       There were initially some throwaway lines to reference outside
SF, but soon it became a hunting expedition, with people paying more
attention to that than was correct.  It got in the way, and this show
has to define itself in its own terms...so the practice stopped.

                                                                  jms
