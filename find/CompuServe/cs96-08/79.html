<pre> Bill Hirst &lt;104106.431@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Pat Tallman is back?
&gt; Joe, do you have to make many adjustments to the story line to
&gt; work her in?

       You just gotta learn to dance while life is throwing chainsaws
and chickens at you...after the first few cuts and pecks, it's easy.

                                                                  jms
