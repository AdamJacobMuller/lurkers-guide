<H2>B5 : Writing is Art?</H2>
<h3>Date: 09 Aug 1996 16:51:53 -0700</h3>
<pre> Laurence Moroney &lt;100546.50@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is this intentional in your work, or just something odd that I am
&gt; feeling when I encounter it???

       It's definitely intentional.  The purpose of any kind of art
should be to make you feel something.  If it's created with passion,
then the work mirrors the intensity of emotion felt by the creator,
passing it along to the viewer, who may not even recognize what's
happening, or be able to pin it down...but it's there.  I write very
passionately, and the show needs to feel passionate to be what I need
it to be.  Otherwise what's the point?

                                                                  jms
