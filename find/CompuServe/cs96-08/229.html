       That's good to hear, and I'm sure a number of other folks
started with the show when Bruce came on.  Whatever the cause, I'm
pleased with the effect.

       And don't feel bad about your initial attitude (assuming you
did); lots of folks had the same initial resistance, often out of a
sense of perceived loyalty to ST.  We learn by doing.

                                                                  jms
