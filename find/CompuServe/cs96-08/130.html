<pre> colin heaps &lt;100622.3610@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; This week however went one better, now I wouldn't like to say
&gt; what they were hinting at but the announcement at the start of
&gt; the program this week was "Special effects WITH a plot, Babylon
&gt; 5, science fiction as it should be", not biased or anything eh??

      I hadn't heard that, that's great, thanks.

                                                                  jms
