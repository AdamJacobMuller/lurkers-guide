       Yes, but almost always in terms of *alien* religions.  ST
frequently addresses religious issues, and yes, mostly in a negative
light...but when was the last time you saw this about a human religion?
See, that's the easy out. You can say whatever you want about the
stupid religious beliefs of the blue-furred Erzani of Cromethiom
Nine...take a shot at the Pope, and you get letters.

                                                                  jms
