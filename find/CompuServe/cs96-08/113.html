<pre> Michael Beemer &lt;71551.1670@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I trust you won't object if I pass your comments back to the
&gt; mailing list?

       Yeah, I've read the books during the rebuilding period, though
I haven't had time to indulge my comics habit for about six months or
so.  For some reason, though, it still feels wonky to me.  I confess
that as far as names go I still prefer Sun Boy to Inferno, and some of
the other renamings have been kinda dopey.  If you're going to change
it (and objectively I know Sun Boy is a bit goofy), you should go for
something a little better than, for instance, Lightning Lad to
Livewire.  Livewire is just an awful name.

                                                                  jms
