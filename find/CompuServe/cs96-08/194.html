<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Would it be possible (and not too much typing) for you to post
&gt; those lyrics here? Maybe upload them as a library file, so that
&gt; they wouldn't go away? Pretty please?
&gt; With a virtual (no calories) hot fudge sundae?

      Will try to remember to do that soonish....
