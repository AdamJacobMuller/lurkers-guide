      One doesn't have to believe in the existence of something to
write about it effectively...there aren't really Minbari or Vorlons,
y'know...you just decide to write about it as though it were a True
Thing.  And that's about how I approach religious characters.  As a
writer, you can choose to be honest in your characterization, or you
can use the medium for propaganda and the advancement of personal
agendas.  The latter holds no appeal for me.

                                                                  jms
