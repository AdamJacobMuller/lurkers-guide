<pre> Simon Pallett &lt;101523.507@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I found myself wondering if Franklin shall eventually find what
&gt; he seeks, or if has he already discovered it, and just needs to
&gt; realise that for himself? And as for the songs...well, Joe, what
&gt; can I say? Is it pure co-incidence that all Vorlon suits shown so
&gt; far, with the exception of that belonging to Kosh, are similar in
&gt; design? Why is his the only encounter suit that I have seen so
&gt; far, that is predominantly green?

      Actually, the new Vorlon's encounter suit is more purple/red
than green. The design is a matter of form following function.

      And yeah, I figured it might be cool to continue the song over
the credits.  That happens one more time this season.

                                                                  jms
