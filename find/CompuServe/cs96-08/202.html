<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;75063.3305@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; So, how was the first day of filming?
&gt; Are you still alive?

       It's frenetic, nuts, lots of running around and little fixes,
we all get a little crazy on first days...but it'll be okay.

                                                                  jms
