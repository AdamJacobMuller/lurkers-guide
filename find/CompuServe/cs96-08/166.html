<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; So when Delenn states that some of the first ones went exploring
&gt; beyond the rim does that mean they went off expolring the
&gt; billions of other galaxies in the universe or different
&gt; dimensions, realms etc ? Is the B5 arc painted on a Galactic sized
&gt; canvas (specifically the Milky Way) or does it hold consequences
&gt; for the known Universe ?

      No, the events take place only in our own galaxy, and only in
portions of that...it's just too big a place.

                                                                  jms
