<H2>B5 FAN CLUB INFO!</H2>
<h3>Date: 09 Aug 1996 16:51:54 -0700</h3>
<pre> Jonathan Kass &lt;74130.443@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Any other suggestions for checking on the status of an order?

       He's dancing as fast as he can, another 1,000 went out this
week.  We have 5,000 members now and just two people manning the club. 
We hope to expand that soon.

                                                                  jms
