<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; That makes me curious,since Babylon 5 is actually shot in a
&gt; widescreen format how do compose your outer space shots? Come to
&gt; think of it, how do you compose shots in general? Do you have to
&gt; make compromises so a scene will look good on a regular TV now,
&gt; as well in the future when the show is out on laser disk and
&gt; HDTV?

       That's more a Foundation question, I suspect...basically, I
think they all just sorta do what looks cool....
