<pre> SysOp Dupa T Parrot &lt;70040.104@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Some of us may want to "roll our own" species, have you given
&gt; thought of how that could be done? Are there plans for that using
&gt; security "certificates" or plain old passwords?

      Yes, there will be security once it's all officially online.

                                                                  jms
