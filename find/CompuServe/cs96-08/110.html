<pre> Simon Pallett &lt;101523.507@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I was just wondering, do you consider the posters to this forum
&gt; 'friends' in the same sense you consider those on GEnie friends?

      I try to follow as much of the general conversation as I can,
but it's a lot to track.

      Re: the CIS/GEnie thing...I was one of the first people around
town to go on-line in the entertainment business.  I was logging onto
Compuserve back in 1984, when you could only get 300 baud access, off
the back of a Kaypro II computer with 128k floppy disks.  This was my
first online network, and I've known a lot of the people here for 12
years.  So there's a certain kinship here.

      With GEnie, that was the first online network to give B5 a real
chance of being anything; a topic, then two, then a whole category,
then two whole categories were set aside for it, and they've believed
in the show for a long time.  It took a lot longer for CIS to come
around and even note the show, or do some of the things that GEnie was
already doing.

      Those are pretty much the main distinctions in how I see the
two.

                                                                  jms
