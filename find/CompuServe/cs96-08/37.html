<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; How about books?
&gt; Just curious - many thanks (will you ever write a book of How B5
&gt; Came to Be, and What Went Into It - people, books, skills, etc.?

      Mentioning or referencing books is tougher, because any segments
are less concise in general, less instantly recognizeable and
self-contained. And half the fun of the poetry references is the
lyrical aspect of it.

      As for a book...maybe someday, down the road.

                                                                  jms
