<pre> Laurence Moroney &lt;100546.50@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; She said 'A circle has no end'?

       No...the notion that a circle has no end is a lot older than
that.

       And the line re: Sinclair was "he is the closed circle, he
returns to the beginning."

                                                                  jms
