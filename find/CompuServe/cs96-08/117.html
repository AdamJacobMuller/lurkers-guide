      I haven't heard anything about how KVOS will be handling the
show yet, so we'll have to see.

      "Who are you for starters?"

      I work craft services at the Babylon 5 stage.  I make the hot
dogs. It's a small job, but I'm proud to be there.

                                                                  jms

(don't read credits, do you...?)
