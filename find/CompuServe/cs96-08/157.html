      The problem as I understand it is that using Netscape will let
us do more of the cutting-edge stuff we plan to introduce over the
course of the coming year than the other systems...avatars, residences,
other nifty stuff. If we go for a less sophisticated interface, we
won't be able to do this stuff.  At least, that's what we're being told
by the designers.

                                                                  jms
