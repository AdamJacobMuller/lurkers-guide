      Thanks.  A lot of people are looking back at season 1 and
finding it better than they remembered, now that they know the
characters.  They also now see the little touches here and there
pointing forward in the storyline.

      The plot-recap stuff is difficult to pull off without being
obvious; you have to slip in the backstory a line at a time, here and
there, so new viewers can follow it but without annoying the constant
viewer.

                                                                  jms
