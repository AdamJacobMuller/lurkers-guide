<pre> Toni Muller &lt;75223.1575@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Could you direct me to someone who could help me go about this?
&gt; Also, I attended Fantasticon this past weekend and wondered if
&gt; you'd consider attending next year, if invited (as if you need
&gt; one more thing to do)?

      I'll try to attend next year; I was just in writer hell this
weekend, and had to focus on the work.

      Your best bet locally is to contact the program director or,
above him, the station manager of the station you're after.  They make
the decisions.

                                                                  jms
