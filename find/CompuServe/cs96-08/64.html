<pre> Richard Wakefield &lt;100534.504@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; What is the relationship between the Vorlons and the Minbari ?
&gt; We have seen a couple of Vorlons on Minbar, is their relationship
&gt; like ours and the Narn for example ? We get the impression that
&gt; the White Star is not as powerful as the Vorlon ships, but surely
&gt; as well as having Vorlon shielding wouldn't it have the powerful
&gt; Vorlon weapons &amp; flower propulsion thingies (those petals) ? Why
&gt; is there a Minbari crew, not one vorlon insight and why do they
&gt; let Sheridan be the captain ?

      The Minbari built the White Star, borrowing some Vorlon tech, so
it's primarily Minbari, and built with their sensibilities, all the
controls are in Minbari, and so on.  They allow Sheridan to command it
because Delenn said to do so, and in battle an unpredictable human
might have options that a more regimented Minbari might not.

                                                                  jms
