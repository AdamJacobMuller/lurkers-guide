<pre> Larry Rosenblum &lt;72122.1555@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is my memory incorrect, or am I missing something?

       No, you're correct...but he could only recognize him once he
actually saw him, and that didn't happen until he arrived at B5, after
which he wasn't in any condition to talk to anyone until after things
were over.

                                                                  jms
