<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;75063.3305@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; One question: I was under the impression that Sheridan was the
&gt; military leader of the Army of Light, is this not correct? Is this
&gt; to be a war by committee? How exactly is the Army of Light
&gt; organized?

      Sheridan commands the Army of Light, Delenn as second.  If the
AOL speaks with one voice on something of importance, they have to be
listened to. When Sheridan put himself on the front lines, he was then
taking on the role of soldier, not commander.  They also felt it risked
leaving them without said commander if it went wrong.

      Bear in mind that their orders in *no* way compromised his
actual mission, or over-rode his decision.  They were sending along a
secondary mission to keep an eye on the primary mission.  I don't see a
conflict here.

                                                                  jms
