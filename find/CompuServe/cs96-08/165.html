      I commend C.S. Lewis to you as a writer first, and a theologian
second. As a writer, he does some nifty stuff...the Screwtape Letters
alone is worth his having walked among us.  The Perelandra (sp?)
books...are okay, but a bit dry sometimes.  His strength was in more
fantasy than SF.  As a theological writer, he had a tendency to set up
straw man arguments a bit too often and too easily for my tastes, but
he's certainly worth the read.

                                                                  jms
