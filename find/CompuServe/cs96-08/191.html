      We figured we'd get an initial membership of about 1,000-1,500,
and staffed accordingly.  We got about 6,000, so all our planning has
gone straight to hell in that regard.  Last I heard from Jim, the last
batches of stuff should be out by mid-week.

                                                                  jms
