<pre> Chris Croughton (UK) &lt;100014.3217@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Out of interest, who was there watching it?

      No, the only people in the room are those involved in the mix,
this isn't a screening, it's part of post-production.  It's me, John
Copeland, co-producer George Johnsen, the sound editors, mixers, sound
supervisor, a few others on the periphery.

      At one point, one of the mixers was working on putting in the
sounds as he went, hadn't yet gone through it all...and kept telling
the sound supervisor (who was asking questions about how we wanted to
handle some later scenes) "don't let me hear this, I don't want to
know, I just want to see what happens next, this is great."  Which in
this town, from folks who work on a lot of shows, is a good reaction.

                                                                  jms
