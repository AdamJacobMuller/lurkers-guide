      John...you're getting too wrapped up in this.  For starters,
having just had a MAJOR WAR with the Minbari, which nearly wiped out
Earth, and many folks back home *hating* the Minbari...do you think for
one second that they're going to believe a word of what the Minbari say
to them?  Do you think the government would allow this to go through
unjammed?  Hell, EarthGov would have a field day with this..."See? 
It's all alien propaganda, just like we told you, they're trying to
destabalize Earth."

      Second, I don't think the Minbari have the propagandists,
writers, directors, and others needed to put together a propaganda
network, and would find the whole idea immoral to begin with...and a
couple of paragraphs of text are meaningless...Earthgov says "it's not
true," and it's your word against theirs.  That's why you must have
absolute, unvarnished PROOF, otherwise it blows up in your face, which
any journalist worth his or her salt knows.

      Again your suggestions don't touch reality at any two contiguous
points.

      Also, I can't keep track of, or answer, 15 or 20 questions in
one message; if you've got a point to make, do so concisely.

                                                                  jms
