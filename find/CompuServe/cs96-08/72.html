<H2>Grey Council Ship ??</H2>
<h3>Date: 11 Aug 1996 14:23:53 -0700</h3>
<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Do all the members of the Grey Council live permanently and
&gt; exclusively on that ship? Do they ever take vacations?
&gt; Does the ship have a name and a class?

      They stay on the cruiser almost entirely during their tenure in
the council, only leaving for personal family crisis/situations and the
like.

                                                                  jms
