<pre> Brian A. Thomas &lt;75231.1122@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Why do the Vorlons hate the Shadows so?
&gt; Will this be ansered later in the show?
&gt; I suppose the mystery of what the old ones are so upset with one
&gt; another won't be known until year 5?

       After "Z'ha'dum," I think you'll have your answer to this.

                                                                  jms
