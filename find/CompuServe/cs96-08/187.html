<pre> Chris Croughton (UK) &lt;100014.3217@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Or have they been forcibly supressed by EarthGov?

      Yeah...ten minutes after I sent the message I did a Simpson
"D'oh!" and realized I was talking about the Amish.  Ah, well...we're
all entitled to one screw-up...

                                                                  jms
