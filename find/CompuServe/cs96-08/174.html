       Good point.

       It can sometimes be annoying...I know there was a fan meeting
of a certain group in the UK at one convention last year where they
insisted, in NO uncertain terms, that my statement about being an
atheist was just a cover, and that I was in fact a religious person
using that as a blind so I could get my views across.

       Language is a precise thing; if you do not say what you mean,
you can never mean what you say.  What I stated in this regard is the
simple truth. Anybody who can't handle that...should just have a little
faith.

                                                                  jms
