       Thanks.  I think in that kind of situation you have to deal in
the straight emotions of the belief, the honest feelings of those
involved, and how they view their lives, and that will keep you on the
heart's true magnetic north...when you diverge into the more doctrinal
stuff, you will always go astray.

                                                                  jms
