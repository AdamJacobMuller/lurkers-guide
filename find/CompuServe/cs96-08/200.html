<H2>B5 FAN CLUB INFO!</H2>
<h3>Date: 26 Aug 1996 17:20:53 -0700</h3>
<pre> Rebecca Eschliman &lt;76072.2345@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Do fan club applications still continue trickle in, flow in or
&gt; downpour in?

       The flow of applications have slowed a little, in large measure
because we've stopped putting the information out there until we get
caught up on what we've got.  Once we've caught up -- and I think
virtually everything has either gone out last week or will be out this
week -- then we'll go out and start beating the drum again.

                                                                  jms
