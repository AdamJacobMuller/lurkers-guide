<pre> Laurence Moroney &lt;100546.50@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Quickie question : What did Kosh2 see on the door behind Lyta?
&gt; They sure looked like Shadow warriors to me, but what are they
&gt; doing following _her_? And why did Kosh2 ignore them?
&gt; Surely they also followed her onto the White Star....why not
&gt; wreak havoc then?

      They weren't following Lyta.  We were in Kosh's old quarters,
and those images were burned into the wall when Kosh died.  Bear in
mind that she doesn't actually meet the new ambassador until the next
scene.

                                                                  jms
