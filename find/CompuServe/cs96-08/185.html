<H2>Quakers on B5?</H2>
<h3>Date: 23 Aug 1996 11:47:18 -0700</h3>
<pre> Jonathan Hoopingarn &lt;73172.1065@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; With tounge (sp?) firmly in cheek I must ask "What?
&gt; No Quakers?
&gt; What civilized society wouldn't still have the Society of
&gt; Friends?" I guess I do have to ask, seriously, "How fair the
&gt; Friends in the B5 universe?"

       Well, if Quakers choose not to use mechanical means of
transportation, only horse-drawn carriages...then I would suggest that
this may hinder their progress in interstellar travel.

                                                                  jms
