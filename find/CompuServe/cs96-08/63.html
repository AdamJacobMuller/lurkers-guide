<pre> Toni Muller &lt;75223.1575@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Like, is there a promotional pack that can be mailed to the
&gt; station, or someone who handles new stations? Or do I just direct
&gt; them to Warner if they are interested?

      No, we don't have any material like that at all.  That's all
handled by WB, we're not in any way involved in distribution.  If
they're interested, they'll know who to contact.

                                                                  jms
