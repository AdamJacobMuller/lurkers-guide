<pre> William H. DiPaola &lt;76521.1751@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is this something that disturbs you as well, or do you take part
&gt; in the decision making process as to which episodes will air
&gt; when?

      It's WB that decides on the rerun order...it's beyond my control
or influence.

                                                                  jms
