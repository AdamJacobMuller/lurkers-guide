<pre> Juanma Barranquero &lt;100044.2131@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Kyle's reactions?

      No, from where I sit, he looked and spoke pretty awed.  So I
can't account for your interpretation; certainly I think the general
concensus was that he was massively impressed.

                                                                  jms
