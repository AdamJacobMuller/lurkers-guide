<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Now if the show was all about cute kids, or a cute kid or robot
&gt; saved the day consistently (whoops, did I say Star Trek?

      Two quick notes...what I said was that we wouldn't have cute
kids (or for that matter ANY kids) in as regular characters a la a
Wesley or the kid from SeaQuest.  We have, on rare occasions, had cute
kids in one-shot episodes...of course, they've generally ended up
shipped off or conveniently deceased....

      Also, just a correction: David Gerrold wrote "Believers," not
me.

                                                                  jms
