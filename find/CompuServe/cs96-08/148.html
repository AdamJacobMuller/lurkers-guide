       Oh, I didn't really do it for the money, there wasn't much
involved at the time...it's not that I wrote it for money, it's that I
wrote it when I was *18* and when you look back at ANYdamnthing you
wrote at 18 the impulse is to shriek and run away.

                                                                  jms
