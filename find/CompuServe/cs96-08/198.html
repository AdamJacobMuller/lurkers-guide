       I don't know specifically what's going on for Sunday...but I do
know that the station group to which WOR belongs has stated it will
keep the second airing, and they are working to move the show into
better time slots. So going from 2 p.m. to 8 p.m. gives us a prime time
slot, which is *much* better for us.  I don't know if they'll keep the
Sunday rerun where it is, but there will be a rerun somewhere.

                                                                  jms
