<pre> Batman &lt;104635.1044@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Ever consider doing a "recap" show, ala the X-Files two "Secrets
&gt; Of" episodes?

      We suggested it to WB, and were turned down, on the grounds that
as a network, Fox can just go ahead and program what the want in those
hours, if it's a secrets-of special or something else; but PTEN isn't
really a network, it's a syndication division, and in syndication you
have to sell each item separately, so they'd have to go out and sell
that one hour special the same way they'd sell a series, and they were
loathe to do that.

                                                                  jms
