<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Do you see what I'm getting at?

      So where is the problem with, let's say, a person putting up a
spoiler that says what basically happens in the episode, adding, "If
you want a more detailed analysis, email me and I'll send it along."

      But bear in mind, again, folks can post here whatever they want;
I'm not in a position to stop anyone.  If I have any moral authority on
an issue -- dubious since I'm not sure where I left my morals anyway --
that's fine, but I'm not going to pressure anybody to do
anything...that ain't how I work.  How people perceive me is beyond my
control, and when the poster here apologized for the long synopsis, I
told him he didn't have to do so.

      This really ain't a big issue, folks...I saw something, had a
gut reaction to it, and said what was on my mind.  I can't start
censoring what I think because someone might take it too much to
heart...yes, the person has a right to post what they want, and I have
an equal right to respond as I feel is appropriate.  I'm being as
honest in my reactions as anyone else.  Who in this room has a problem
with that?

      Unless you're saying I should just shut up when I see something
I feel strongly about...which seems to me just as bad as anything else
being discussed here.

                                                                  jms
