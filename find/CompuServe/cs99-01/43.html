<pre> Carl Cantarella &lt;105030.3700@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Didn't you tell me last year that after season five wrapped that
&gt; you were going to make more of an effort to take some time off
&gt; and enjoy some of the simpler things in life that you never have
&gt; time for, such as watching a sunrise or something?

      No, for me it's never a problem as far as the writing goes. 
It's usually all the OTHER stuff that makes me nuts...the dealing with
studios and networks and suits and the like.  The writing is the reward
for dealing with the rest.  In particular as far as RISING STARS
goes...this is a form that is still fairly new to me, so it's an
ongoing learning experience, and that's great, it uses parts of the
brain that don't normally get used in this way.

      I don't think you can ever get burned out on something you love
doing.
