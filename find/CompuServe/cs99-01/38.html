<pre> Michael J. Kersey &lt;73642.3137@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I was just curious if Babylonian productions has been looking at
&gt; producing any outside (B5) projects or if it has been focusing
&gt; just on "Crusade"?

      It's all we can do to focus on one project at a time just now,
particularly at the launch of a new show.

                                                                  jms
