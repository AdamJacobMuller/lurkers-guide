<pre> Brian Makuch &lt;104125.736@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; What the heck is up with TNT?

      I am in total darkness when it comes to understanding TNT's
philosophy of promotion.  They did little for this, I guess because it
was the last of B5 in someone's view, promoted the hell out of the
Houdini flick, which cost about 3 times more than we did...and we ended
up getting exactly the same ratings.  With a little real promotion, we
could've done even better.

                                                                  jms
