<pre> David Manders &lt;100641.1115@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; May I add my congratulations?
&gt; Assuming that your cameo of turning off B5 was among the last
&gt; scenes shot, that must have been quite an emotional moment for
&gt; you - or are you too involved in films or spin-off programmes (
&gt; History of the Alliance, or Mollari's 'Career' perhaps )&lt;g&gt;?

      Thanks...and yeah, it was tough to do.

                                                                  jms
