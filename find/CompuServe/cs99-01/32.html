      I like the music.  I like the edginess of it.  I wouldn't do
that particular style on a regular basis, because I think it would wear
thin after a while, but for this movie it was right.  He's doing more
thematic stuff for the series, but keeping the approach of using a
variety of styles, including Chinese scales and stuff, which makes the
episodes sound nifty and exotic.

      So yeah, I like it...but I also like the kind of edgy, growly
stuff Ry Cooder did for LAST MAN STANDING, so go figure.

                                                                  jms
