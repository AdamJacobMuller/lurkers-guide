<pre> David Manders &lt;100641.1115@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; How, in general, are the 'frequent irregulars' contracted, and
&gt; how are their parts shot? Are they contracted to be 'on call' or
&gt; are all their scenes for a series shot in one set of sessions, or
&gt; perhaps a mixture of both?

      You contract with an actor for 8, 13, 18 or 22 episodes.  You
then use them for those episodes within a given period of time.

                                                                  jms
