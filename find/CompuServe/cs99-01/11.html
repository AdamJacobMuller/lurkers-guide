<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; How much less likely are they to care about preserving something
&gt; as ephemeral as a TV show?

      This was a problem on the pilot; WB stored the film and
negatives, and rats got to a number of film cans, chewing through
prints and negatives alike. As we found when we went to re-edit, some
takes are gone forever.

                                                                  jms
