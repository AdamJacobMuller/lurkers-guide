<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Was this deliberate, or was it just an outgrowth of Chen's
&gt; different style? Or was it just my imagination?

      I spot the music on everything, from movies to the episodes. 
That means sitting with the composer and saying "music in at 1:07:13
(one minute, seven seconds, 13 frames), out at 2:23:18."  When we did
the pilot, I wasn't sure how much music it did or didn't need, never
having done this before, so I went drier than I should have.

      In the case of CtA, I knew we were going to have some wall-to-
wall music later, so I held back a bit earlier on, otherwise you do way
too much to fit in, and you over-burden the composer.  River was also
spare at the top.

                                                                  jms
