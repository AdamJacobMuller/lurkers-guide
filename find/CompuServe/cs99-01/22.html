<pre> Dave Vincent &lt;75460.1133@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Ramming Speed?
&gt; What the heck is that?

      Ramming Speed.

      If you are approaching a target at speed X, you still have a
chance to peel away at the last moment.  If you are approaching a
target at the top speed your engines can provide, such that you cannot
turn away or be deflected, that's speed Y.  Speed Y is ramming speed.

                                                                  jms
