<H2>More Crusade rumors....</H2>
<h3>Date: 29 Jan 1999 22:38:12 -0700</h3>
<pre> FRANK J. FURFARO &lt;74031.1005@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Any chance of you setting us straight on this latest rumor?

      The plug has not been pulled by TNT, which cannot pull the plug
because we don't work for TNT, we work for WB.  TNT is a distributer.

      All I can say for now is that, like Oliver Stone's project for
TNT, Witchblade, we have found that TNT (known primarily for westerns,
historical dramas and wrestling) is not SF-friendly in terms of really
getting what SF is about, and it may not entirely reconcile with what
their core audience expects from them...and that a new, more SF
friendly venue is being explored.

      So if folks wanted to drop an encouraging note to, let's say,
the Sci-Fi Channel, for instance, that would certainly be okay by me.

      But in the interim...no, we're not canceled.  We're taking off
next week to allow WB to work its magic, but that's about it.

                                                                  jms
