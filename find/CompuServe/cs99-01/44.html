<pre> T.P.Chai &lt;104674.3064@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; So the "Top Cow" issue will have the preview?

      The Top Cow/Wizard issue will have the script for the preview
issue, which will be published as issue 0...and the book that will be
published as the preview will have the script for what would be issue
0...the thing is to make sure that the various parts and pieces come
out in the correct sequence.

      They're both 16 pages, both similar in all the same production
elements, it's just the sequence of the story we're trying to make sure
stay right.

                                                                  jms
