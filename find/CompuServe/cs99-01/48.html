<pre> Graham Smith &lt;74010.764@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; A visit to the old homestead?
&gt; How much of an increase has been necessary to allow for the
&gt; continuing requirements of new sets for the locations in Crusade?

      There was a slight increase in budget for Crusade, but all in it
averages out to only about $20,000 per episode.  We're still mainly
doing things smart, not expensive.

                                                                  jms
