      Yeah...it's always a mug's game.  I've been fairly lucky that
way; I'd say that about 80% of what I've written has been either
published or produced. The one area where things have sold or been
optioned but never produced has been in the area of non-TV movie
screenplays.  I guess it's in part because my heart isn't in it as much
as television, and because the stories I tend to do in screenplay form
tend to be little character stories, which are fun, but not big
smash'up adventures, which seems like all they're buying these days.

                                                                  jms
