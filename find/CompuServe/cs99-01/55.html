<h3>Date: 26 Jan 1999 20:28:11 -0700</h3>
<pre>      I just got back from a meeting at Top Cow (a division of Image),
which is publishing RISING STARS, a 24 issue miniseries I'm writing. 
I've turned in the preview issue, issue 0, 1 and 2...and they've
decided to make this their number one priority for this year.  Some
copies of the preview script have been leaked to a few places by TC,
and the reaction has been enormous. A number of comics retail chains
are going to throw their weight behind it, several magazines are
planning major stories on it, there have already option inquiries by
studios...anyway, it's fun.  This is an arena I haven't played in that
much, and the reception that the material is getting is just nifty.

      For those who've inquired, here's more of the skinny: the
preview issue, and issue 0, will be published in March/April.  The
former will be packaged free with bagged copies of Wizard Magazine
(it'll be the Top Cow issue).  It really gives you a sense of the book,
and where it's going.  So if you want to check it out, I'd strongly
suggest getting the preview book.

      The first actual issue appears on newsstands in June.  They want
the two months for heat to rise after folks see what's in the preview
and the zero issues.

      Basically, what I've tried is to do in the comics form what we
did with B5...and so far, it seems to be working.  A few reporters I've
spoken to who've seen the material think it may be the big event of the
year in comics (which is very flattering, but I'm always skeptical of
such pronouncements; only the readers can decide that).

      Anyway, for those who are B5 or comics fans and want to check it
out, them's the figures.  There may be shortages, I'm told, even though
they're going for a huge print run on issue 1 and the preview issue, so
you may want to place an order with your local comics store to hold 'em
for you.

      The great thing, for me, is that even though we're doing this
story for adults, with a lot of hard hitting stuff, it's a) at heart,
in the end, an optimistic story, and b) though it has adult themes, and
some elements that may be controversial, they're handled in a way that
parents shouldn't worry about their kids seeing 'em, as B5 dealt with
themes in such a way that they crossed generational lines.

      Anyway, if you couldn't tell, I'm *real* proud of the book, and
wanted to pass that along.

                                                                  jms
