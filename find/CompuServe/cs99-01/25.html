<pre> Carl Cantarella &lt;105030.3700@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; If you don't mind my asking --and I'm glad to hear that the movie
&gt; performed well-- but just what were the numbers?

      It did 2.8, which was a higher number than they were expecting
(they'd sold the ads at 2.7, which means they made money off it), and
equal to the Houdini movie.

                                                                  jms
