&gt; Submitted for your consideration: sometimes the music and sound
&gt; effects became confused - was that a weapons discharge/hit, or a
&gt; techno-percussion note? Were the repeated clashing/crunching
&gt; sounds at the end of the battle mood conveying music, or the
&gt; sound of the Drahk hatches opening to spew out the bio-weapon?

"Submitted for your consideration: sometimes the music and sound

end of the battle mood conveying music, or the sound of the Drahk
hatches opening to spew out the bio-weapon?  I also thought that the
music was occasionally mixed too loudly."

      The first part of that is a common problem in an action show;
most of the really interesting music happens at the bottom, using the
lower frequencies.  But the lower frequencies are also where you'll
usually find explosions, clashing, crunching, banging and the like...so
sometimes the two get muddy.  You clear out one or the other as much as
you can, but sometimes it overlaps and you get fuzziness in the track.

      As for mixing it loudly...yeah, I've generally done that on B5. 
I like my music loud.
