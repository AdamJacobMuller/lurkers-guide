      I think #1 is slated for May or June.

      Because the Wizard Top Cow issue is coming out a month sooner
than they had anticipated, apparently the 0 issue will have the Preview
script, and the Preview issue will have the 0 script, 'cause it's
essential that the Preview come out first, one way or another.

                                                                  jms
