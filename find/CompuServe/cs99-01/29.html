<pre> Dave Vincent &lt;75460.1133@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Why not maximum speed or full speed ahead?
&gt; Does EF rules provide for ramming of other starships?

"Seems an odd order.  Why not maximum speed or full speed ahead?  Does
EF rules provide for ramming of other starships?"

      Because it also implies "...and we're going to HIT that ship." 
Ramming speed says both.  You could say, "Give me maximum speed, set a
course to RAM the ship," or you could say "Ramming speed."  Same exact
content, shorter terms.  Brevity is our friend.  Pedantry is not.

                                                                  jms
