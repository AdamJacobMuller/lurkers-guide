<pre> SysOp Dupa T. Parrot &lt;70040.104@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Do you know if the cards will be available through the usual
&gt; retail sources?

      Yeah, they'll be out.  I've seen the final versions, and I think
this may actually be the best set to date.  What they do, which none of
the prior sets do, is to choose one key image per episode, and put the
key phrase from that episode on the back...so that each card kind of
recreates the feel of the episode.  They're very very cool.

                                                                  jms
