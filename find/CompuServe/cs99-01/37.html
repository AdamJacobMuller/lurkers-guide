      That question would take me hours to answer...more of it is now
than was before, because I started to get more hands-on with it. 
Certainly the new novels from Del Rey that I'm writing the outlines for
are canonical, the Drennan novel is nearly all canonical, much of the
Cavelos novel is canon, and so on.

                                                                  jms
