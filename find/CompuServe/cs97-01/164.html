       The amazing thing about TV Guide is that here we are, doing
this show for 4 years, with 2 Emmy awards, a Hugo award, a bunch of
other awards, the fifth highest rated syndicated drama series...and in
those 4 years we have never, ever had a B5 cover on TV Guide.

                                                                  jms
