<pre> Rebecca Eschliman &lt;76072.2345@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Does WB tell you if they're promoting B5 at NATPE each year (this
&gt; year in particular, since the whole 4 or 5 season termination is
&gt; such a burning question)? If so, do they tell you the results, or
&gt; do you have to rely on industry jungle-drums to find out how B5
&gt; fared at NATPE?

      We've never heard squat about NATPE or much of anything else
over these four years.  Also, NATPE is mainly useful for selling new
shows, not renewing older ones.

                                                                  jms
