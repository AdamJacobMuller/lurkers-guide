<pre>I've recently heard that the reason we haven't seen the Babylon
Project from Chameleon Eclectic is because they never received the
proper permission from you to create it.  Is this true or is it hung up
for the more usual RPG-never-on-schedule reasons?

If you haven't given permission, is it forthcoming or is the game no
longer a possibility?

Thanks for your time.

Sue
