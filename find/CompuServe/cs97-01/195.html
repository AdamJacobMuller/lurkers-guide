<pre> Scott Baker &lt;76072.1744@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Correct me if I'm wrong, but everything you shoot is stored
&gt; digitally for final mixing and the CGI effects to be added,
&gt; right? So, what are dailies and how are the stored?
&gt; And what happens to the data after the episode is sent off?

       Dailies are the actual film, developed overnight and
transferred to video.  The videotapes are then digitized, and dropped
into the editing machines.  Once editing is finished, the main disks
containing the digitized dailies are wiped; we only keep the list of
shots and frame counts for the supercomputer to use in assembling the
film.

                                                                  jms
