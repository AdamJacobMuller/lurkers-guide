      Actually, they're written in order, and whoever you're buying
them from will likely have that information, or they'll be released
that way.  From memory, I don't have them in front of me, it goes from
Triplanetary to Lensman, Second Stage Lensman, Grey Lensman and
Children of the Lens...I think that's right....
