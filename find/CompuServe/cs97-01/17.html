<pre>      It's affected me in that it has put me in touch with the
audience, which is a rarity in TV, where all you usually get are the
raw numbers.  It's given me a sense of the room, as it were.  It's kept
me answerable and responsive, and that has the side effect of keeping
you modest and honest.

      It hasn't substantially affected the B5 storyline because the
story is the story; any big committee, network or otherwise, will only
work against you at the creative level.

                                                                  jms
