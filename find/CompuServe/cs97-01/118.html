<pre> Michael R. Brehmer &lt;75303.2242@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Do you believe that "network suites" are following that
&gt; philosophy to a certain degree? Or is that many people's
&gt; perception that network TV used to be better mere nostalgia? Even
&gt; with your busy schedule, do you ever get a chance to watch any
&gt; network TV?

      I don't get much chance to watch TV these days, for obvious
reasons.  I try to carve out room for X-Files, Simpsons, 60 Minutes,
The Tick, the Larry Sanders Show, Dateline, Nightline and a couple of
others, but that's about it for the week.

                                                                  jms
