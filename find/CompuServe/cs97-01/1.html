<pre>      Actually, I was in the shower...and I don't usually have a
computer there, as it's rather dangerous.

      "I wondered if you know what you'll be doing after (B5 is) all
over."

      Depends.  WB is very interested in the sequel series, and we
hope to have some info on that by the end of the month.  That I'd
definitely want to do.  Barring that, I'd like to find a show or a
structure where I could push the envelope again but in a different way.
If I can't find a show like that, or create one, I'll go back to prose.

                                                                  jms
