<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;75063.3305@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Had you or anyone else thought about getting TNT to fund the re-
&gt; editing of that movie the way you originally wanted it?

       We've talked with them about it, and there's still nothing set
yet. We think we may be able to get this reworked to some extent, at
least re-edited, with some new CG, but it isn't final yet.

                                                                  jms
