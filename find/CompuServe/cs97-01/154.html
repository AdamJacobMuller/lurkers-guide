<pre> Scott Baker &lt;76072.1744@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; But would most studios care in other situations?
&gt; Where else have you walked from?
&gt; And, if I may ask, why do you do all of this (make the show, talk
&gt; with us, deal with the studio, etc)?

       I walked off THE REAL GHOSTBUSTERS when they decided to soften
the characters and turn Janine into a mommy figure, off CAPTAIN POWER
when they decided to give the sponsor (Mattel) more control over
stories...and others.

       Why do I stay on the nets?  I was here before B5, and I'll be
here after, to one degree or another.  I see no reason to change.

                                                                  jms
