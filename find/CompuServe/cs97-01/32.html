<pre>Joe,

In "Interludes and Examinations", Morden had to physically open the
door to Kosh's quarters in order for the Shadows to enter even though
they appeared to pass through the walls.

In the the "Garibaldi's Last Stand" scene in "Babylon Squared" and
"War Without End Pt 1," it was implied that those attacking had to cut
through the walls in order to invade (and the hole was not
Shadow-shaped).

Why is this? Or will this be covered later this season?
