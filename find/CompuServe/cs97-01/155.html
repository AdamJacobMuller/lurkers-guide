<pre> MrsPeel &lt;103112.2040@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Someone in Hollywood with artistic integrity?

       There are lots of folks out here with integrity; they're just
not as colorful to write about, and they don't fit in with accepted
cliche.

       Mainly, I'm genetically a pain in the butt.

                                                                  jms
