<pre>Everything you say is correct, of course, but I'm convinced that with
the Viacom/Paramount decision much more is at stake than the mere
protection of their copyrights.  If that were all they were concerned
about, less draconian action, like the action taken by Warner, could
have been chosen.  I'm convinced that the MSN site has everything to do
with their decision.  Many fan sites were far superior to anything over
at Continuum (I don't belong to MSN and don't intend to, but a friend
does for her business, and I've seen the site), and thus in direct
competition with the exclusive, money driven MSN site.  Of course I'm
sure you know all this, but I'm just raising the point.
