Upon rewatching "...Wolf" one slight question occurred to me:

When Kosh was "tutoring" Sheridan and set up the Moment of Perfect
Beauty, did Kosh have the Lorien experience in mind as something for
which to prepare, or was the relinquishing of the pin leading to an
interesting encounter more to do with authorial artistry?

 -rje-

I can almost feel the rustling-in of some kind of enchantment already.
