<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; How long does it take Andreas to get made up every day under
&gt; normal circumstances (excluding the last couple of episodes)? What
&gt; does he do all that time?

       Last I heard it takes about 2 hours, not too bad, actually.

                                                                  jms
