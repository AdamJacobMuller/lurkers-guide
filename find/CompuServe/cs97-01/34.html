<h3>Date: 04 Jan 1997 02:30:07 -0700</h3>
<pre>With Christmas about to set in, people around the world were busy in
preparation for the holiday. Out of nowhere, Viacom / Paramount
started handing out Christmas presents to numerous web master  a legal
warning letter to tell them close down their Star Trek Internet web
site or else.

For those of you who want to read about the letter, here is an
abstract:

 ----- Re: Infringements of STAR TREK Copyrights and Trademarks

Dear (name here):

I write as attorney for Paramount Pictures Corporation ("Paramount").

As you are, no doubt, aware, Paramount owns all the rights to the
television series entitled STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION, STAR TREK:
DEEP SPACE NINE, STAR TREK: VOYAGER, and all theatrical releases
relating thereto (collectively the "STAR TREK Properties"). These
rights are protected by numerous copyrights trademarks in both the
programs themselves and the characters, sets, and other elements
appearing in those programs.

We have recently learned that you have posted various elements of the
STAR TREK Properties on your site at (web site address here). Your
posting of these items is an infringement of Paramounts copyright and
trademark rights in the STAR TREK Properties.

Paramount does not, of course, object to all materials posted on the
Internet relating to the STAR TREK Properties. For example, Paramount
does not object to the general discussion of "Star Trek" over the
Internet. However, when such discussions rise to the level of copying
full scripts or excerpts therefrom, or providing detailed summaries of
the works, suck transmissions are clear infringements of Paramounts
rights. Similarly, posting of copyrighted material such as photographs,
artistic renditions of "Star Trek" characters or other properties,
sound files, video clips, books or excerpts thereform are likewise 
infringements of Paramounts rights.

Based upon the foregoing, we hereby demand that you confirm to us in
writing within ten days of receipt of this letter that: (I) you have
removed all infringing materials from your site, including all images,
sound bites, and video clips; and (ii) you will refrain from posting
any similar material on the Internet or any other on-line service in
the future.

The foregoing is without waiver of any and all rights of Paramount
Pictures Corporation, all of which are expressly reserved herein.

Whats Wrong? Viacom Has Every Right To Do This!

True! Even I must agree. Viacom's action seems so reasonable ... and
yet to completely idiotic as not to be believed!

One thing must make clear at this point. IF a site private Star Trek
Properties for use in commercial manner or in any other way related to
commercial activity, then Viacoms action is a just one. But what
happens here is very different. How can a site maintained by a 14-year
old kid be a thread? Most sites were created and maintained by Star
Trek fans, these sites never charged a single cent. These sites were
created as a publicity and promotion mean to introduce others to the
show. It is these sites that saved Paramount billions in advertising.
It is these sites that snow ball paramounts income in the first place.

Star Trek had been and shall continues to be Paramounts valuable
asset. What makes Star Trek successful is the fans behind the show. It
is the fans who frock to theater to see the Star Trek movies; it is the
fans who pay for memorials; it is the fans who promoted the show to
others. For some mysterious reason, Viacom also think it is the fans
that is hurting their profits???

Is Viacom stupid enough to believe one will settle for an poster image
instead of the real thing? One will be satisfy by owning a 10-second
sound clip instead of a sound track? One will opted for a 20-second
video clip instead of the video tape or laser disc?

Internet was a place for freedom of speech, and I fail to see Trekkers
had abused their right. On the contrary, images, sound clips and video
clips are more like a bate to seduce us to buy the real thing  and in
return, put our hard earned cash into Paramounts pocket.

I sincerely hope Viacom will come to its sense REAL SOON. Otherwise,
the Trek community will become so hurt that it might not exist any more

If you want to learn more about this disaster, use the site
http://www.stwww.com/viacom.html as your starting point to learn more.

If you feel it is time to act, please write to Viacom or Paramount and
let them know your feelings.

:) Rgds.
