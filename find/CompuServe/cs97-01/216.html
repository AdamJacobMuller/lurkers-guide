<h3>Date: 30 Jan 1997 12:31:55 -0700</h3>
<pre> Michael Beemer &lt;71551.1670@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; "He" being Maher?

       He didn't know what the blacklisting was...if he did, he'd know
that 90% of those called before HUAC had *nothing* to do with the "Evil
Empire" of communism, and have been shown to have been innocent.  If
anything, the hearings gave aid and comfort to the other side.

                                                                  jms
