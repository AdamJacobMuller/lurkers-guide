<pre> Scott Baker &lt;76072.1744@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; How do they make a profit?
&gt; From syndication fees?
&gt; Or is there other evenue streams?
&gt; And, if I may ask, how do you get paid?

       They get their money from commercial advertising and foreign
sales. I get a piece of the *net* profit, and since the numbers are
always jigged so that no TV show or movie ever shows a profit, we know
how much that will result in...zilch.

                                                                  jms
