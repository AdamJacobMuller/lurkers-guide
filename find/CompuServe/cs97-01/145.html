<pre> Hugh Kennedy &lt;70042.710@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; And WB still don't want to release B5 on tape in the US?

      It's got nothing to do with making money...if you look around,
aside from the cartoon stuff, NO WB series are out on disk or tape,
because that division prefers to deal with guaranteed big sellers
(Batman, etc) than with TV, which they feel is kinda below them.

                                                                  jms
