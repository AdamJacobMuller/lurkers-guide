<pre> Scott Baker &lt;76072.1744@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; How do you keep from becoming ensnared in what THEY want the show
&gt; to be?

      Fortunately, most studios don't know what they want...they only
get into it if whatever it is, isn't working.  B5 is working, so they
leave it alone. Also, I think they know by now that if a project I care
about is going to be bastardized...I walk.  I've done it many times
before, and wouldn't hesitate to do it again.

                                                                  jms
