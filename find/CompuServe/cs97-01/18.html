<pre>I'm wondering, Joe, do you at all know Harlan Ellison? I'm a fan of
his works...

As a literary SF lover, I'm sure you've read Asimov. My favorite works
of his are the Foundation novels (atleast the original trilogy... the
only one I liked of the later four was "Foundation's Edge", and even
that paled in comparison with the original trilogy). I'm also an avid
fan of his robot novels...

Do you, with all your responsibilities, still have time to delve into
the realm of literary science fiction?
