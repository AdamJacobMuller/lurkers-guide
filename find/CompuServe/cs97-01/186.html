<H2>B5 CD #2 is Available!</H2>

      So what do you think?  I've listened to it about five times now,
counting the two times prior to approval, and I like it a lot.

      Here's the interesting thing, and it shows how sometimes you can
never quite shake the fanboy aspect in your (my) perceptions.  When I
first listened to the CD, and I spoke to Chris, I gave him a series of
notes, based on how much I liked the first CD, to make it more in
keeping with that.

      I went on at this for some time, and Christopher pointed out
that it was obvious I liked the first one...but that if he went along
with what I was saying, it would make the second soundtrack just like
the first one...in which case, why make it?  Which was just what I'd
been saying about wanting to do the sequel series, if it's picked up,
in a different way.

      We all come to like something a certain way, and want the next
one to be just like the *last* one.  And I realized that he was utterly
correct, and I let it go through without changes, trusting to his
creative instincts.

      After the finished CD came in, I listened to it again at the
office, and called Chris.  "I'm glad you stuck to your guns," I told
him.  "You were right and I was wrong."

      Which is the other good thing about B5...nobody here is afraid
to argue with me if they think they're right.  I expect nothing less.

                                                                  jms
