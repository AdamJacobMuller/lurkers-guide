<pre>&gt; It would take place after the main B5 arc.  As for specifics on cast,
&gt; nothing can be said until things get closer to being nailed down;
&gt; there's still a lot that can change on this, and it's a question of
&gt; what works best for the show, and who wants to move on, and other
&gt; aspects. 

        It sure sounds like Claudia is with you if you want her there.
&lt;g&gt;
                I was encouraged by how happy she is not only to be
with this show, but *why* she's glad to be with it, and her high praise
for you and your ability was beyond reproach. Quite frankly, she may
have even gotten some people within your industry a bit hot under the
collar by what she said, which delights me to no end. However, it may
not be in her best interest to do such things unless she's real
confident in her ability as an actress and is not worried about
politics standing in the way of her career.
