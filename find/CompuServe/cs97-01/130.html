<pre> Tom Knudsen &lt;72347.1626@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Has there ever, in the history of television that you know of,
&gt; been a hit show (a big hit, not just a show that stuck around a
&gt; couple of years) that was instigated/designed based upon this
&gt; research??

      Not that I know of.

                                                                  jms
