<pre>      Our budget is under $1 million per episode, and we have run
slightly UNDER budget every season, which I think is a first for any SF
series.

      To convince WB we first had to make the pilot, show we could do
it responsibly, and get the ratings, THEN we got the series order.

                                                                  jms
