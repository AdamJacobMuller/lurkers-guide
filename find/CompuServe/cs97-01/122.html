<pre> John Ordover-Trek Editor &lt;72674.1362@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Finally one Viacombot said "Well, how do you know the fans even
&gt; want an Encyclopedia? Did you do a focus group?"
&gt; Our producer relpied "How about the 750,000 people who bought the
&gt; book version?

       Back at you:

       WB did a focus group for B5.  Peeled of 20 folks for an in-room
review, the rest of us watching through mirrored glass.  One guy hates
the show vehemently, keeps saying it's not science fiction.  Finally
the guy running the group says, "Could you tell us what you feel is an
example of good science fiction?"

       And the guy says, "Power Rangers."

       I damn near went through the glass at him.

                                                                  jms
