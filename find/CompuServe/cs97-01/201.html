<H2>Season 5 Cancelled?</H2>

<pre> JOHN GRAVES &lt;102735.1124@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Any comments?

       If I had anything to say on this, I would've said it.  All I
know is that this exact thing has happened before in previous seasons.

                                                                  jms
