<pre> Jonathan Kass &lt;74130.443@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Just got around to really trying to breakdown the opening title
&gt; sequence, haven't been lurking here for a couple of months, don't
&gt; see any messages, so am curious if this has been "documented" -
&gt; who says what? Is this right??

      Not quite...rebirth goes to Lyta (since Pat had just had a kid
recently), and Claudia got the year everything changed, to put her in
the same grouping with Jerry and Bruce.

                                                                  jms
