<pre>&gt; Well, large boarding parties tend to cut through walls to get large
&gt; groups through, 

Yeah, I can see *that*.

But what about the scene in "Interludes and Examinations" where, after
Morden opens the door, the Shadows appear to pass through the walls. If
they can pass through the walls, why do they need an opening?
