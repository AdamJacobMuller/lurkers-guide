<pre>&gt; Two primary reasons why it was a hard sell: 1) SF has *always* gone
&gt; way over budget.  The "V" series singlehandedly nearly destroyed
&gt; Warner Bros. Television.  Producers always said they could do it, and
&gt; they lied, and the studios and networks were very skittish. 

Ok, now you got me really curious, what is your budget and do you ever
run over?

&gt; 2) They're skittish about SF in general, and space stuff in
&gt; particular.  We were told, repeatedly, in verbatim terms, "No space
&gt; series other than ST has ever survived more than a couple of sesaons.
&gt; There is no market for space SF other than Star Trek.  The market
&gt; won't sustain it, isn't big enough to sustain it."  That was, hands
&gt; down, our single biggest stumbling block. 

So what finally convinced WB to do B5, especially after V?
