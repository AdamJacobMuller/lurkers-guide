<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;75063.3305@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I don't know what you think of the man, but have you heard that
&gt; John Rhys-Davies is available? Do you prefer them over
&gt; contemporary? TVG: What science-fiction novels have you enjoyed?
&gt; Would you sign up if the opportunity presented itself?
&gt; Wouldn't you?

      Hmmm...interesting....
