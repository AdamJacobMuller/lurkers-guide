<H2>B5 TV ratings?</H2>

       Here's the insidious part of all this...they say they want a
ratings system, but of *course* it won't be used for censorship
purposes, they just want it for informational purposes...and the system
wasn't even in place for a week before pinheads like Rev. Wildmon were
out there calling for a boycott of EVERY show rated TV14, on the
grounds that it shouldn't be on TV. (Leave out the insanity that you
only have to create a TV15 rating, make all the TV14's another
category, and suddenly *they're* okay, the same programs would be fine,
if there were another nastier category.)  It's the same thing that 
happened with record ratings, which were instantly used to pressure
some record stores into not carrying more mature fare.

       It sucks.

                                                                  jms
