<pre>&gt; I saw most of it all at once, and spent the better part of a year
&gt; getting it all down on paper. 

The entire 1000+ years at once?  What were you doing when that
happened?  So I am assuming the details have come as you've written the
episodes and it was the overall scheme of things that came to you?

When did you see the end of the story?

Thanks for taking the time with these questions.
