<pre> John M. Graham &lt;74166.3727@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I am curious of whether my friend's view is prevalent in the
&gt; industry, whether it is technically accurate, and whether such a
&gt; view has hampered (or maybe helped?) to some extent your ability
&gt; to market B5 accross the country?

      All I know is that in 4 years, I've never heard anyone in the
industry refer to B5 as a soap.  So that may answer your question.

                                                                  jms
