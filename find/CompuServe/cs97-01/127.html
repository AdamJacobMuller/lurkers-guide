<pre> Roseann M. Caputo &lt;103510.1542@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Just out of curiosity, have you ever seen "Politically Incorrect
&gt; with Bill Maher?" I know, I know, but what the hey, it nevers
&gt; hurts to dream, no?

       I have no special urge to see my face on TeeVee, frankly...I'm
a writer, and happy just with that.

                                                                  jms
