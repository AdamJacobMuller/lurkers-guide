       Just one problem: I never SAID "Crusade" would not have a story
arc. I have only said that it won't be as *intense* an arc as that on
B5, because the tone is somewhat different, because I don't want to do
the exact same thing twice.  But it will have an arc to it.

       My suggestion: wait until you see what it IS before you ask me
to make it what it's not.

                                                                  jms
