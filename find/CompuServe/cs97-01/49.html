<pre>&gt; Claudia is notoriously fearless.  Actually, that applies to most of
&gt; our cast, which is fun.  If you see interviews with our cast, they're
&gt; right out there on the edge, being outrageous...because that's who
&gt; and what they are.

        I tell ya, I really loved it! &lt;g&gt; It came right near the very
end of the article and it was the last thing I expected to see. :)
                                Go Claudia!! &lt;bg&gt;
