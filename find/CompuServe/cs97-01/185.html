<pre> Meryl Yourish &lt;103470.2703@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; How has B5 changed me?

      Re: "Never eat anything bigger than your head"...that goes back
a long ways.  It's part of a litany of country-wisdom stuff that has a
long history. I think the first part of it is, "Never eat anything
bigger than your head, never eat at a place called Pop's, never shoot
pool at a place called Mom's, the difference between horses and people
is that they're too smart to bet on what we'll do, and a fool and his
money were lucky to get together in the first place."  I like that last
one particularly.

                                                                  jms
