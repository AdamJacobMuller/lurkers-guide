       Thanks.  The White Star mission in that ep has definite roots;
during WW2 to convince the Germans we weren't going to land at
Normandy, our own agents were fed incorrect information, set
loose...and then info was leaked to the Germans allowing them to pick
up the agents and torture the information out of them.  This wasn't
quite as bad as that, the crew at least knew what they were getting
into...but there are often no good choices in war.

                                                                  jms
