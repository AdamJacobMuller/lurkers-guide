<H2>Do it all over again?</H2>
<h3>Date: 01 Jan 1997 18:40:46 -0700</h3>
<pre>      I had nothing to do with the marketing of the series itself, so
I can't affect that either way.  What I'd do different with the
show...I'd just love one more chance to adjust every episode, but
that's an after-the-fact thing. What I'd do different otherwise...I
dunno.  Maybe nothing.  You take a different tack, you just run into
different problems, never fewer problems. So it's hard to say. 
Overall, I'm as pleased as anyone can be with a show.

                                                                  jms
