<pre>from message #631358 &gt;&gt;RebelCon 1997 is coming August 8-10, 1997 at the
same Taunton Holiday Inn in Massachusetts that saw this year's
successful convention on July 5-7, 1996. This year's announced guests
(as of January 1, 1997) are:  J. Michael Straczynski, creator and
producer of Babylon 5 (in one of his few East Coast appearances!);&lt;&lt;

        Joe, I'm just curious, but do you have some kind of an
aversion to New York? :)                I guess to see you at a
convention I'd have to travel out of state.
