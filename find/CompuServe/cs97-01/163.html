<pre> Roseann M. Caputo &lt;103510.1542@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; How does the process work in choosing a director?
&gt; Do you have input and/or final say?
&gt; Just out of curiosity have you ever considered Jonathan Frakes?

      Given that Paramount already pressured one director associated
with ST not to work with us, I'd rather not take that chance again.

      We choose directors based on prior work, a demo reel of their
stuff, a personal meeting, and gut instinct.  They have to understand
that the job is to service the text, not to rewrite or change.  We look
for directors whose work shows a great visual style, and who are
willing to take chances.  We get some directors who come to us because
they can't do the kinds of things they want to do for any other show. 
Here, we *encourage* them to experiment.  The worst that'll happen is
that it'll fall short.  Big deal.  If you succeed, it's brilliant.

                                                                  jms
