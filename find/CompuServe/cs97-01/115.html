<H2>B5 TV ratings?</H2>
<h3>Date: 16 Jan 1997 02:07:59 -0700</h3>
<pre> Scott Baker &lt;76072.1744@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; What kind of a show would get a TV-M?

      Apparently, the TV 14 is not a permanent thing...whether this
changed after we complained, or it was always going to happen, I
dunno...it'll change from episode to episode.  Funny thing is, NObody
at WB knows who assigned it that rating.

                                                                  jms
