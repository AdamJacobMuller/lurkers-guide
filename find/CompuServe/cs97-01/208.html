<H2>Scott Adams cameo</H2>
<h3>Date: 29 Jan 1997 11:54:08 -0700</h3>
<pre> Scott J. Epstein &lt;71514.2733@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; For those of us with friends and aquaintances who are Dilbert
&gt; fans and occasional B5 watchers, can you tell us which episode
&gt; Adams will appear in?

       I seem to remember dropping his cameo into "Moments of
Transition."

                                                                  jms
