<pre> T.P. Chai &lt;104674.3064@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; What I'm wondering is, the dialogue about Vir being "harmless",
&gt; was that written before or after you realized what should happen? 
&gt; In general, do you go through a lot of drafts and
&gt; insertion/deletion?

       No, I usually go through only a couple of drafts.  The line
about Vir seemed correct regardless.

                                                                  jms
