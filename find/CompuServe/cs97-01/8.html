<H2>"Crusade" Spinoff?</H2>
<h3>Date: 31 Dec 1996 17:04:19 -0700</h3>
<pre>I just read about your as yet fully formed concept of a B5 spinoff
involving the rangers. I would like to know some of your specific ideas
regarding this proposal.  1. Does the story take place before, during,
or after the 5 year B5 arc? 2. What characters, assuming you
can sign up the actors, would be involved?-Dellen, Marcus, Lanier,
Sinclair ?
