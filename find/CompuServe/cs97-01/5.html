<H2>G'Kar's monologue</H2>
<h3>Date: 30 Dec 1996 21:51:46 -0700</h3>
<pre>&gt; The writing of it...this is just an estimate, trying to remember, but
&gt; I think it took me about 10-15 minutes.  Which is actually a long
&gt; time for me to stay parked on any part of the page.

  Well, now I don't feel so bad.  I realize my brief, occasional
scribbles don't come close to yours (or anyone else's), but I've found
that when I try to put pen to paper, either it comes flying out at top
speed, or it doesn't come out at all.  That, and I tend to avoid heavy
re-examination of what I've done - if I look at it too long, I start to
second-guess myself.
