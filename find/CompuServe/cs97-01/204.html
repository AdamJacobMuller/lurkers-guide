<pre> matt greenslade &lt;111111.1445@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Can anyone answer why Garibaldi has a security level of
&gt; 'Ultraviolet Alpha' (presumably high) and yet in the same
&gt; conversation last series reveals that he has been dismissed from
&gt; his last four jobs? I mean is he a hacker, a liar or a very lucky
&gt; guy?

       He got his clearance when he came onto B5, after Sinclair
fought to get him the job.  And that clearance mainly pertains to B5
stuff.

                                                                  jms
