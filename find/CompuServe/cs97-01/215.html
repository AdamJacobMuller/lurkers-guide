<pre> Jean S McKnight &lt;105513.130@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Forgive me for being out of the loop, but I was just wondering
&gt; (you see, I got B5 religion sort of late in life and hence missed
&gt; the early eps, except those I begged copies of once it hit me) if
&gt; anyone knows what ever happened to Catherine Sakai? Did she go off
&gt; to Minbar with him? Did he just go traipsing back in time without
&gt; so much as a phone call? Or was it just not dealt with, what with
&gt; the universe needing to be saved and all? Or maybe she took one
&gt; look at Sheridan and was too overcome by lust to remember her own
&gt; name, let alone Sinclair's? Whatdaya think?
&gt; Any chance she'll show up again, and maybe a technomage can give
&gt; her a one way ticket to Valen-land on the orange blossom express?

      The fate of Catherine Sakai will be revealed in a coming B5
novel from Dell.
