<pre> Jean S McKnight &lt;105513.130@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is this cerebral cineplexing a learnable skill, and if so do you
&gt; have any suggestions as to how to learn it?

      I dunno...I've always been this way, seeing it in my head. 
Helps to have been a solitary-minded kid, I suppose, always off by
myself.  When I first began to read novels, I saw them in my head in
full technicolor with surround sound.  Especially with Bradbury's
stuff, which is full of imagery; I can still summon up my mind's eye
view of Usher 2, the Martian deserts with their silver windsailing
vessels, the race for the ship in "The Golden Apples of the Sun"...it's
the way I'm hardwired.

      Which is why my scripts for B5 (and most shows) are *very*
detailed; I don't just write action and dialogue, I go shot-by-shot,
close-ups, fades, juxtaposition of shots, lighting, sound, framing of
actors, all of it, to try and most precisely recreate the script (and
the episode) to look like what I saw in my head.

                                                                  jms
