<pre> John M. Graham &lt;74166.3727@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Was there cleverness?
&gt; Again I ask, why do they follow him still?

      I think the main reason the Minbari have a problem with the
Black Star incident is mainly because it happened to *them*.  And even
there it's mainly the warrior caste that's annoyed by it...even though
they were en route to doing something just as reprehensible, the
equivilent to strafing lifeboats in WW2.  Frankly, I don't think the
warrior caste would give a fig who else it happened to...they're
outraged because it happened to *them*.

                                                                  jms
