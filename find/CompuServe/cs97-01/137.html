      No, the figures are correct.  DS9 does rate higher than B5,
though it's lost about 18% of its ratings over the last year, according
to the trades, while B5 has been gaining over the same period of time. 
Interestingly, on a head-to-head basis with new episodes, we're
generally only about half a point behind Voyager.  DS9 averages a
couple of points ahead of us.

      BTW, I found out the other day that apparently when Scott Adams
had done the Dilbert cover story, he'd intended for B5 to get the
cover, but the folks at TV Guide put Star Trek on at the last minute
because they felt it would sell more copies.

                                                                  jms
