<pre> Scott Baker &lt;76072.1744@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; So I assume that you get paid a salary as well as the
&gt; (non-existant) net? Is there anyway you can get a better deal?

       Yes, I do get a per-epsode producing fee, and script fees.

       No, no chance of changing the deal, it is what it is...and no,
I do not personally own B5 in any way, not in copyright, licensing, any
of that. WB owns all rights.

                                                                  jms
