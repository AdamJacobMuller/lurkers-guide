       The deal is that what makes for a great novel is not what makes
for a great movie in most cases; novels are internal, movies are
external.  And often execs hear about a big SF book, they don't know
anything about it except that it's popular or famous, and they option
it...then find out what it is and have no idea how to make it...or what
it was...or why it works... and after buying it for what it *is* they
try to make it into something it's *not* because they're more
comfortable wit what it isn't but could be than what it is and can't
be.

       And the fact that I actually understood what I wrote and was
entirely serious in it suddenly tells me that I've been in this town
WAY too long.
