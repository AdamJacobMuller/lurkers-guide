<H2>Historical reference?</H2>
<h3>Date: 05 Jan 1997 05:30:43 -0700</h3>
<pre>In my most recent viewing of Hour of the Wolf, I noticed that the
metalwork in Cartagia's palace looks suspiciously like the "rising sun"
emblem of Japan. Is there a historical significance that my meager
knowledge of history in general and military history in particular is
preventing me from seeing, or did it just look cool?  All I can come up
with is a parallel between Cartagia and a kami-kazi pilot.
