<H2>Killing Kosh2 etc.</H2>
<h3>Date: 10 Jan 1997 00:46:46 -0700</h3>
<pre>Hi!

A couple FTA questions if you have the time:

During the battle between Sheridans forces and Kosh2, why didnt they
allow Kosh2 to escape once he broke out of his encounter suit?  Were
they concerned Kosh2 would take them all out before he left?  Or were
they unaware he was trying to make a getaway?  Or did Sheridan really
want to kill him - was that Sheridans ultimate goal or would he have
been satisfied if Kosh2 left the station when Geribaldi asked him to?

And why did Kosh2 leave through the ceiling instead of the floor
(which should be the faster way out right? -- or was he too busy
fighting with Kosh1 to notice)?  How far can a Vorlon travel and how
long can they stay in space without a ships protection?

Also - Delenn prizes life.  How does she feel about Sheridan murdering
one of the ambassadors?  She seemed to have a sick look on her face
when she was watching Kosh2 being shot down.  Did she support Sheridans
decision, and will it affect her perception of the man who has returned
from Zhadum?

Wow - more questions than I meant to ask  And I can think of 100 more,
but Ill stop bombarding you.  I appreciate any insight!

Thanks!
Debbie
