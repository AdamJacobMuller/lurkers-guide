      Thanks.  Mike is one of our core directors; he wasn't available
to us for the first batch of episodes because another show locked him
down before we got renewal notice for year 4 (you can't book directors
if you don't have a commitment), but he's directing one now, and is
going to do a bunch more. He's a great visual stylist.  If I know we're
going to have him as a director, I'll actually write the script a
little differently and call for the kinds of visuals I know he can give
us.

      Funny story...turns out that in Spanish, "vejar" means to abuse,
degrade and humiliate.  So one day, all the crew vanished from the set
mid-day and reappeared moments later wearing bright red shirts with
black type reading "I'VE BEEN VEJARED!"  They're still very popular.

                                                                  jms
