"So in other words, you like it here (the Nets) and you do what you do
(make great stories) because you're having fun, and you don't
compromise on principle.  That must be hard in the town you're in."

      Not really.  Not as long as you know what you're in the business
for. I'm a storyteller.  The rest is superfluous.  And it's not really
that hard because I live a sensible life...if they take it all away, I
should still be okay, and I can go back to writing books, or teaching. 
A story is a story, doesn't matter to me which venue it is.  Where this
town gets you is if you're in it for the money.  Money's nice, but
doesn't really mean that much to me...you can only sleep in one bed at
a time, drive one car at a time, eat one meal at a time...how much do
you *need*?

"Joe, you are a truly remarkable man, much like the ancient Bards of
old.  In my humble opinion, you are Shakespere and Homer wrapped up in
one."

      Not a chance.  If I work hard and write my brains out, then in
20 years *maybe* I'll be fit to carry their pencil cases, but no more
than that.

                                                                  jms
