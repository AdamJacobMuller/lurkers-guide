<pre> Scott Baker &lt;76072.1744@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Will we find out about Crusade at the same time as year 5?
&gt; Or are they under different groups?
&gt; Are the movies confirmed, and will there be more movies after the
&gt; 2 by TNT?

      The two TNT movies are confirmed; I imagine I'll hear about the
sequel before I hear about year 5, but the difference in time will
probably be only a few weeks.

                                                                  jms
