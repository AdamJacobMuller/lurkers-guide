<pre> Scott Baker &lt;76072.1744@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; So when you pitched it to them and they agreed to make the show,
&gt; did you get paid for the rights, or do they get the rights in
&gt; exchange for making the show?

      They get the rights for financing and distributing the show; we
make the show.

                                                                  jms
