       Two things....

       The episode that preceded "The Long Night" aired last
week...and bear in mind that Cartagia has never been shown to be
weak...he's young, and Londo ain't...he takes pride in being a lady's
man, so given that he got behind Londo, a weak position for anyone,
it's very reasonable.

                                                                  jms
