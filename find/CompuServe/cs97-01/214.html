<pre> Roseann M. Caputo &lt;103510.1542@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; The whole scene with G'Kar and the other Narn and then to have
&gt; them ask, what did he endure????? And Vir, I didn't even see that
&gt; coming? Did he?
&gt; When you write, does it ever feel like that there's this person
&gt; inside your head who keeps bugging you to tell a story about
&gt; them, or do I need that vacation more than I know??? Do you have a
&gt; lute at home?

      Certainly there's an obsession to get this story out.  And the
characters are alive, on one level...because you have to imagine them
as being real in order to write them.  22 times a year I crack a window
to peer in at them....
