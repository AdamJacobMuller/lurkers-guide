<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Does the audience NEED to be as big for a syndicated show
&gt; compared to a network show in order to survive? I think you
&gt; mentioned in your "Quick Requests from JMS" message something to
&gt; the effect B5 has about 10-15 million viewers -- would that be
&gt; enough to sustain it on one of the big three or even the little
&gt; two (UPN, WB)?

      It doesn't need to be a BIG audience, but it does need to be big
enough to make a profit.  And that's what they didn't know.  Since
then, they have made a very tidy profit on B5 already.

                                                                  jms
