<pre>      Urk...I'd forgotten about the MSN site.  I wonder also if there
is any advertising at that site.  That might also prompt them to want
to drive people there for ST material, so they can ensure there's only
one place in town to get it, and then collect ad revenue.  Nothing
wrong with advertising on a web site in and of itself, of course; it's
a natural progression that will, in time, give sites greater resources
to do stuff.  Most web sites are "dead web," interesting to look at,
but with the resources to make the site very deep.

                                                                  jms
