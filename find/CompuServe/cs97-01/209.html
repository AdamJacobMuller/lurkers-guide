<pre> Scott J. Epstein &lt;71514.2733@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I'm thinking of the scene when Cartagia (with his hands covered
&gt; with G'Kar's blood) finds Londo and Vir in the garden, and says
&gt; to Vir, "What are *you* doing here?"

       Who knows, sometimes the characters know more about this stuff
to come than I do....

                                                                  jms
