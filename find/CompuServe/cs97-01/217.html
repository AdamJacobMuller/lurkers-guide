<H2>Season 5 Cancelled?</H2>

<pre> Alan Mulvie &lt;100566.1444@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I'm sure you would keep us well informned, but on a metter of
&gt; copyright/ownership if the worst came to the worst and Warner
&gt; Bros pulled the plug on Season 5, would you be able to take it to
&gt; another station/production company? I don't know how this all
&gt; works, but for instance could Paramount or Fox legaly allow you
&gt; to finish the five year arc?

       No, the show can't leave WB for any reason.  It's this or
nothing.

                                                                  jms
