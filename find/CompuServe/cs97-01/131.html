<pre> ben dibble &lt;105430.3170@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Joe, do you ever wonder if your doing ever so many episodes for
&gt; B5 is going to make any others following in your footsteps have
&gt; second thoughts about "the arc thing?"

      I think a *lot* of people wonder about me.

      And it doesn't have to be done by one person; the third year it
came about because so much was changing, so much was happening, it made
it hard to bring in anyone...in year four, I've had to structure this
extremely elaborate tree so I can flip either way depending on whether
or not we get a fifth year, and again you just can't farm that out in
any realistic way.

      I'm *very* much looking forward to never, ever doing this
(writing an entire season or two singlehanded) again for the rest of my
natural life....

                                                                  jms
