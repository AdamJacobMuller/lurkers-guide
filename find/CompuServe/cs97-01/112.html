      Our visibility is increasing, no mistake, but we still haven't
hit critical mass, and most viewers/reviewers are still largely unaware
of us. But that's okay, I went into this figuring this would be a long
haul.  Once the show is done, it's done, and nothing will ever change
that; the only thing that will change is the size of the audience.

                                                                  jms
