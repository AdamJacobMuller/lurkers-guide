<pre> Scott Baker &lt;76072.1744@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Do you have all the scenes you shot for the piolit on disk
&gt; somehwere? One other thing I just thought of, how long do you keep
&gt; the shots from the episodes on disk?

       We don't keep them on disk after we finish editing; in the case
of the pilot we're redigitizing dailies to go in and make our changes.

                                                                  jms
