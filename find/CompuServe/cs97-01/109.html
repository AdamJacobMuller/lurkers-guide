<pre> Scott Baker &lt;76072.1744@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; So I take it this is an industry standard set up?
&gt; So how would you, in the future, get a bigger piece of the pie
&gt; you've created (such as with Crusades)?

      Yep, that's how they get you, and yes, I hope that the success
of B5 will allow for a slightly better deal on the new show, though
again the definition of net profits will almost certainly still be such
that it adds up to oh...about zip....

                                                                  jms
