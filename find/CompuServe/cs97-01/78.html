<H2>B5 CD-ROM?</H2>
<h3>Date: 09 Jan 1997 12:17:22 -0700</h3>
<pre>       I just got the full soundtrack (58 minutes) yesterday...I'm
going over it now and making notes and some suggestions.  Shouldn't
take much longer to make the small changes and get this puppy out the
door.

                                                                  jms
