<pre> John Ordover-Trek Editor &lt;72674.1362@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Thing is, they're talking about the -same- book.&lt;G&gt; That ever
&gt; happen to you on episodes, getting "too thin" from one person and
&gt; "too fat" from another, when they are talking about the same
&gt; episode?

       Yeah, that's common...one person wants more EFX, another more
character, another more arc...and if it doesn't have one of those
things, that which works for them best, sometimes it gets written off. 
That's one of the things you learn in workshops...that you didn't like
it doesn't mean it's bad, only that it didn't work for *you*.  But on
many occasions I've seen a note from someone who felt that, because it
had no CGI in it, it was perforce bad.

       Which is why, in the final analysis, one must listen to the
small voice in the back of one's head when writing.  If networks
comprise one sort of committee, fandom -- well-intentioned as they all
are, and as sharp as they all tend to be -- is still another (and
larger) committee, even more diverse. As you say, there's no one thing
the fans want...they're not some monolithic group...they're a diverse
and fasacinating group.

                                                                  jms
