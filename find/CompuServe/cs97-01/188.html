<pre> Sanjiv S. Purba &lt;102735.1770@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; How does one get to bid on a book contract that needs to be
&gt; filled? Is it possible to submit a book proposal?
&gt; How do you submit ideas for other types of licences?

      You need to write an outline and submit it, though lately we've
been assigning books to published authors based on a premise from
in-house.  You can't just submit ideas for licenses...a company has to
approach WB with an offer and a business plan.

                                                                  jms
