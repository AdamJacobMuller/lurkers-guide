<H2>TD: Rod Serling</H2>
<h3>Date: 03 Jan 1997 16:18:03 -0700</h3>
<pre>       Everyone who came up as a writer during that time was in danger
of being blacklisted or greylisted, or at minimum knew other writers
and actors who had been listed and had their careers killed.  Some
actors, like Jeff Corey, didn't work again for almost 20 years.  So
certainly it had a profound effect on Serling and others.

       As for Corwin...yes, Rod was a big fan of Norman's work, and
cited him as a kind of writer's writer.  He began trying to do
Corwin-like stuff, as did Bradbury and many other writers.  Norman is
one of those writers whose work may not be known to the public as well
as it should, but writers, any writer interested in genuine quality of
language and vision...we know his work. People like Bradbury and Stan
Freberg and Charles Kuralt and others have all described themselves as
"Norman's kids" for the inspiration he has provided.

                                                                  jms
