<H2>B5 CD-ROM?</H2>
<h3>Date: 08 Jan 1997 23:15:29 -0700</h3>
<pre> I was just reading some old posts from you in the Lurker's Guide
about a B5 CD-Rom (from Comton's?) that would be released someday
including some cool features like voice recognition and the ability to
build a small scene using a

set of dailies.  Any word on the current status of this project?

If this topic has been beaten to death, I apologize.  Just sounded
like a real neat piece of software and I'd like to get more of an
insight on how the creative process works on B5 (including the actual
software you use to do your editing, mixing, etc).

Thanks!
Debbie
