<H2>B5 CD-ROM?</H2>
<h3>Date: 09 Jan 1997 05:36:17 -0700</h3>
<pre>&gt; That one has been put back, though we're doing a different CD rom in
&gt; house currently.

                                                               jms &lt;&lt;

Speaking of CD's, does Chris Franke have a definite release date for
the second music CD yet? I know the Sonic Images web page says January
but it's January now. Also if there is a release date is it a US only
date or world-wide. I'm over in the states at the end of the month so
if it is a US release date I'll have to have a look out for it whilst
I'm there.

Thanks in advance..
Darran...
