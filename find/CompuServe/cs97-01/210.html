<H2>NATPE &amp; Rumors</H2>
<h3>Date: 29 Jan 1997 22:44:55 -0700</h3>
<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Is it possible that somebody sold you a bill of goods about the
&gt; value of going to NATPE? Would B5 have fared better if people had
&gt; been pushing it at these industry shindigs? Do you have someone in
&gt; WB Domestic TV seriouly honked off at you? Or is someone trying to
&gt; generate support, using reverse psychology, by floating a
&gt; cancellation rumor, so the loyal fans will rise into a collective
&gt; high hover and start yet another letter writing campaign, to
&gt; "rescue" the show?

      I understand...thing is, people carried back the same reports
from the same NATPE convention *last* year...so where does one start?

                                                                  jms
