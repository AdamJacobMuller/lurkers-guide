<pre>&gt; It's kept me answerable and responsive, and that has the side effect
&gt; of keeping you modest and honest.

And that's one of the main reasons we like you . . . sort of a
symbiotic relationship, or something. . .

&gt; It hasn't substantially affected the B5 storyline because the story
&gt; is the story; any big committee, network or otherwise, will only work
&gt; against you at the creative level.

Have you ever done anything on the show because of a feeling or
request on the nets?
