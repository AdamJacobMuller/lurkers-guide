<H2>B5 TV ratings?</H2>

<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; And, while I've got your ear, what is your opinion on the TV
&gt; ratings?

       I think we got stuck with a TV 14 rating...and frankly, I think
the ratings system is massively stupid, and will be broadly ignored.

                                                                  jms
