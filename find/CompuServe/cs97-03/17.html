<pre> Deonaha M. Conlin &lt;102531.2627@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is there a way for those of us not in The Business to glom onto a
&gt; copy of FCC rules?

      I imagine that anyone writing to the FCC in Washington DC can
obtain a copy of the rules, since the FCC is a public agency,
regulating the public airwaves, to ensure they conform to the public
"interest, necessity and convenience."

                                                                  jms
