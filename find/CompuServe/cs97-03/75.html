<pre> JOHN GRAVES &lt;102735.1124@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; JMS, Are you still participating in the CIS forum?
&gt; When I left a posting for the sysops, &gt;&gt;Who Killed JMS&lt;&lt; the
&gt; responses seemed very defensive (gee, I wonder why?

      I'm here...and the sysops have generously altered the position
of sfmedone to allow for greater flexibility, and for that I think they
deserve considerable praise.

                                                                  jms
