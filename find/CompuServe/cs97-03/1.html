<pre> Scott Baker &lt;76072.1744@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; So what exactly is your relationship with Netter?
&gt; I've noted you saying you don't work for him, does Copeland?
&gt; And I've noticed he is an Executive Producer, does that mean you
&gt; two have equal "ownership"?

      Yes, we both have equal ownership of Babylonian Productions, but
Netter Digital Entertainment is his separate company, I have nothing to
do with it, don't work for or with it or own any of it.

                                                                  jms
