<pre> Tom Knudsen &lt;72347.1626@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; The fact that Mir is the Russian word for peace wouldn't have
&gt; anything to do with you using it for her family name.....would
&gt; it?

       Yeah, there's that, and it nicely intersects with the fact that
Delenn is portrayed by MIRa Furlan.  It's kind of a bank shot.

                                                                  jms
