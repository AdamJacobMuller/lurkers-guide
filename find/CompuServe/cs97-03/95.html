<pre> Rob Carr &lt;73200.2754@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; But who would want to win such an award?
&gt; What's it mean if you let someone else win?

      Well, for starters, I don't think it would be letting someone
else win; nominees would be submitted, and the best of that batch of
nominees would win in head-to-head competition.  We've been bypassed
for the occasional Emmy nomination even though I think some of the work
done that year in those areas was at least as good as anything done
elsewhere...does that diminish the kudos to the ones who *did* win?

      Beyond which...even if SFWA *were* to start working on restoring
the dramatic nebula -- the chances of which are roughly equivilent to
an ostrich giving birth to an iguana -- it would take them a couple of
years minimum to do it, by which time B5 is over anyway, and who knows
if any later work of mine will be in the SF area at that point anyway? 
(It's likely, but one never do know...I ended up on Murder She Wrote
for 2 years, remember.)

      Either way...my concern is the principle at work here.  If
disqualifying or refusing the Neb myself is the only way to ensure that
this ain't a personal agenda, and thus make the road easier for
somebody else down the road, then that's jake by me.  But, as stated,
the odds of this are slim and none.

                                                                  jms
