"The ultimate irony is that *you,* our resident atheist, promised to
regale us with a plethora of censorable biblical quotations!"

      Who better?

      Y'gotta understand, I've read the thing *twice*, cover to cover.
(And ANYone with the patience to get through Deuteronomy, Numbers and
Leviticus has my enduring respect.)  It's actually a pretty good book,
all things considered, and despite some misuse by some of its readers. 
There's good drama, lots of melodrama, an overall arc (and an ark),
some good writing and some utterly *awful* writing, blood and thunder
and some racy material, the perfect ingredients for a
potboiler...except that it's often redeemed by such terrific parts as
Psalms, and parts of the Song of Solomon, and Proverbs, and the story
of Job, which is probably one of the best stories ever written.

      A good editor would've helped *enormously*, but one can't expect
god to be all things at once....

                                                                  jms
