<pre> Meryl Yourish &lt;103470.2703@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Was Lorien the man in between?
&gt; Was Sheridan the man in between?
&gt; Was Justin the man in between?
&gt; Okay, if you won't answer those three, then will you answer the
&gt; following? Was Refa the one who was already dead?

      Refa was never already dead, so it can't be him.  Dead is dead,
and the only one who fits that description would be Sheridan.

                                                                  jms
