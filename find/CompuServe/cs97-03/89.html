<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; JMS, sorry to bother you but why isn't the Volume Two CD out in
&gt; stores?

      Actually, a very few stores *have* gotten it in...but sonic
images decided to fill all the fan orders first, and have gotten
somewhat overwhelmed.  Once they catch up, they'll hit the stores.

                                                                  jms
