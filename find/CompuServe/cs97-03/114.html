      1) The re-edit is likely going to be paid for by WB.

      2) It's a VERY bad mistake to intervene in business negotiations
between a production company and a studio...you will ONLY end up
pissing off the people who you want to pony up the dough to do
something, and that will be the end of that.

      TNT has been *extremely* enthusiastic about the show, and doing
all they can to promote it.

                                                                  jms
