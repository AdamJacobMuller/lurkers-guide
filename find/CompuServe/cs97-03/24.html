<H2>TNT Air Order</H2>
<h3>Date: 03 Mar 1997 01:08:27 -0700</h3>
<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; What order will TNT air the episodes in?
&gt; In the original air order, or in the order you originally
&gt; intended, that for various reasons aired differently?

      I'll be discussing this issue with TNT in the near future, at
which time we'll get into the preferred air order, which probably won't
be a problem for them to follow.

                                                                  jms
