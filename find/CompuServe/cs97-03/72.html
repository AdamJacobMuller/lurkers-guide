<pre> Scott Baker &lt;76072.1744@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Have you ever considered directing?

"Have you ever considered directing?"

      With great trepidation, and at the urging of Warner Bros., I've
decided to direct one episode this season...not because I have any
particular ambition to be a director, but because I think it will help
me become a better writer by more fully understanding that side of the
camera.  Given how massively busy I am already, this decision will
almost certainly be called as evidence in any sanity trial that might
take place in future.

                                                                  jms
