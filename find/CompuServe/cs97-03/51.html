<pre> Scott Baker &lt;76072.1744@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is the directors cut typically different from a producers cut?
&gt; Is there a differnce between TV and Movies on how they would
&gt; differ?

      A director's cut can be the same as, or vastly different from,
the producer's cut, depending on what the director does, and how much
in sync the director is with the producer.  But the producer gets final
cut in TV, whereas the director gets final cut in films (unless the
studio or a big name producer has it contractually otherwise).

                                                                  jms
