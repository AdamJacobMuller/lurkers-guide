<pre> Douglas Piligian &lt;70760.2440@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Now if Delenn has not voted, how can there be a tie vote?
&gt; They needed more than a simple majority What say you oh Great
&gt; Maker?

      Others in the Council died, as was noted when the one says, "Our
brothers?"  "Dead," Delenn says.  So there were others.

                                                                  jms
