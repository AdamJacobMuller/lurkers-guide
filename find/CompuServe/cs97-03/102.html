<pre> Scott Baker &lt;76072.1744@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Why didn't Delenn tell John the truth about her trip to Minbar,
&gt; and won't John be slightly ticked off when he finds out the
&gt; truth?

      "Listen, honey, while you were out I went to the store and I
bought some new candles, you know how we're always running out, and
Lennier took the cat in to be cleaned, and oh, did I mention I was
directly responsible for the deaths of two hundred and fifty thousand
of your best friends and fellow officers?  Pass the sugar."

      She'll never tell him.

      Because it's over...what would be the point, except to ruin what
they have now.

                                                                  jms
