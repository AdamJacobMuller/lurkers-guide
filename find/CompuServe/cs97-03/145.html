<H2>G'kar - Cross?</H2>
<h3>Date: 26 Mar 1997 15:09:22 -0700</h3>
<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Was that intentional?
&gt; Also, are Narn usually strong enough to break the unweakened
&gt; chains, or was that just an extra bit of adrenaline or equivalent
&gt; on G'kar's part?

       I think one can make the argument there is some symbolism in
there from christian literature, but that kind of scene takes place in
other belief systems as well, and historically that sort of torture was
used in many places, including the Roman empire in general.

                                                                  jms
