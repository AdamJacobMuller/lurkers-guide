      It took me a while to run this down, but I have the info:  I
have not been formally approached by this convention in Germany, and
will not be going. The convention was mentioned to Bruce, but he has
not confirmed and is not going, and is distressed that they are using
his name.  I do not believe Andrea is going either; only Jerry has so
far indicated that he will be there.

                                                                  jms
