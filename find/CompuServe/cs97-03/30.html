<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; What caste is Lennier, and do every member of a clan belong to
&gt; the same caste?

      Lennier is religious caste; and all members of a given clan
belong to one caste.

      There are, for instance, no religious caste members of the Star
Riders (military caste) clan.

                                                                  jms
