<pre> Scott Baker &lt;76072.1744@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; So in films the director provides the thematic vision of the
&gt; movie, wheras in TV the producer provides that vision?

       Correct.  In many films, the director is there from the start,
working on the vision...in TV, a director comes in 2-3 weeks before you
shoot, and walks into a situation where the vision is already set.

                                                                  jms
