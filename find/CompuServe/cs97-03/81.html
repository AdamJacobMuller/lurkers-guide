<pre> Carl Cantarella &lt;105030.3700@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Joe, You're gonna actually do it after all?

"I read the article in the latest Sci Fi Universe magazine, and
honestly, I don't know how you do it all. God, talk about stress!"

      1) I have no choice.

      2) You just shrug your shoulders and you do it.

                                                                  jms
