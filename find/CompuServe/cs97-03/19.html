      I see.  Though, that would apply only to SFMEDONE, if it got the
PC label...you could still hold COs on SFMEDTWO, with different forums.
In other words...let's say, worst case scenario, SF1 gets PC'd.  No
opening menu announcements.  But SF2 is *not* PC'd.  So the CO could be
held there; and since they're both (presumably) under the same roof, it
all works out the same, yes?

                                                                  jms
