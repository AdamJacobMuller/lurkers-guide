<H2>The Real Corwin</H2>
<h3>Date: 14 Mar 1997 03:44:14 -0700</h3>
<pre>      For those who know that one of my chief mentors as a writer was
(and is) Norman Corwin...who was also one of the main inspirations to
such other writers as Ray Bradbury, Rod Serling, Charles Kuralt, Stan
Freberg and others, here's your chance to actually experience some of
it.

      A number of his radio dramas (and some scripts) have just been
made available via The Mind's Eye.  They include performances by such
folks as Jimmy Stewart, Vincent Price, Ray Bradbury, Elsa Lanchester,
William Shatner, Edward G. Robinson, Lionel Barrymore, Orson Welles,
Jill Eikenberry, Groucho Marx, Robert Benchley and others.

      You can get a catalog from 1-800-411-MIND, or from their website
at www.lodestone-media.com.
