      But, see, Mike, there's the contradiction...when you talk about
SFWA being tolerant and inviting, you're generalizing from the
individuals to the group.  But when I do the same, you say, "No, no,
those are just the individuals."  When enough individuals say
something, it becomes a group opinion, and hence an organizational
opinion.

      Basically, you're saying that if the action is *positive*, it's
SFWA the organization speaking...if the action is *negative*, it's just
the members talking, thus giving the group deniability.

      You can't have it both ways, Mike.

                                                                  jms
