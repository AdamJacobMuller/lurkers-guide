<pre> Scott Baker &lt;76072.1744@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Why were they so interested in you directing?
&gt; Which one?
&gt; Are you going to act as well to cover all the bases?
&gt; What does your wife think of your schedule?

"Why were they so interested in you directing?"

      Well, they know the show is really my vision, and they're
curious what it would look like if it was also followed through behind
the camera.  And as our liaison with WB said, "We like it when our
creative people spread their wings a little."  They like the show, and
it does well for them, and they're just generally supportive that way.

                                                                  jms
