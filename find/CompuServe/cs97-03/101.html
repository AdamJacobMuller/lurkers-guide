<pre> Scott Baker &lt;76072.1744@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Didn't Londo have a prophecy about not killing the one who is
&gt; already dead? So, with the flash forward in WWEII we see him
&gt; sparing Sheridan, thereby avoiding his fate, right?

      The goal was to *redeem* himself.  Sparing Sheridan was part of
that. Then he had to surrender himself to his greatest fear: his death
at G'Kar's hands.

                                                                  jms
