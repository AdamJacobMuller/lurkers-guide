       No, if you keep watching Dukhat comes in, followed by Delenn,
through the opening (the empty spot) and then another Minbari comes in
to fill that spot.

       (Sudden thought...I have to check to see if we *used* that shot
or if it was just in dailies...but if you count the Minbari there at
the end of the scene, you'll find the count is correct.)

                                                                  jms
