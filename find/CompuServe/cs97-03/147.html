<pre> Dr John A Purvis &lt;100341.1147@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; There was some talk about a Book featuring Catherine Sekai is
&gt; this still mooted? Also if there is a recurrent theme of lost and
&gt; missing females, how about Lyta between her disappearance after
&gt; the gathering until her return?

       Catherine Sakai is one of the major characters in the third of
the current batch of new B5 novels.

                                                                  jms
