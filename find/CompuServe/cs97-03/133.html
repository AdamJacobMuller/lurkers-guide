<pre> Becky Murphy &lt;76131.1534@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I was wondering (since it's not in the Lurker's Guide) who
&gt; is/will be directing "Racing Mars", "Face of the Enemy",
&gt; "Intersections in Real Time" and "Between the Darkness &amp; the
&gt; Light"? Also, are there any new episode titles you can share with
&gt; us?

      Intersections is John LaFia; Darkness is David Eagle.

                                                                  jms
