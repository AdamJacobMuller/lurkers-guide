<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Are you and Harlan still on for I-CON at Stony Brook, Long
&gt; Island, in three weeks?

      I'm trying to still be there, but I'm working out some problems
with the convention, when has stuck me on 4.5 to 6.5 hours of panels,
presentations and the like per day, with little or NO breaks in between
to eat or rest, and insisting that I *have* to do all of it, and that's
just plain hideous.  If we can come to a reasonable understanding on
this, then yeash, I'll be there...if not....

                                                                  jms
