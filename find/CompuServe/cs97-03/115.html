<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Was Delenn's clan expecting her to do another transformation to
&gt; undo her "humanness"? Since the transformation had made her
&gt; "genetically compatible with the humans", isn't she now
&gt; genetically incompatible with Minbari? Or would she have been
&gt; expected to remain childless? Perhaps the equation of Sinclair
&gt; becoming mostly Minbari was balanced by Delenn becoming mostly
&gt; human, but what has this to do with migrating souls? It must have
&gt; migrated!)?

      Yes, some Minbari on the Grey Council think that Sinclair opened
up the "soul door," for lack of a better term, and Delenn's actions can
be seen as a kind of back-fire, closing the door again.  Ain't
necessarily what's true, but what they believe.

      And yes, they would've had Delenn remain childless, but would be
allowed to marry a Minbari.  And, again, it's a matter of marrying a
non-Minbari with or WITHOUT kids...it's a very inflammatory sort of
thing from a cultural perspective.

                                                                  jms
