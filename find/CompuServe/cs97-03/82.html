<pre> PAUL SHEWARD &lt;100256.1563@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Don't suppose you want to buy an autograph card do you Joe ?
&gt; Hasn't anyone convinced Jerry "Bruce Willis' twin brother" Doyle
&gt; to come to Blackpool for convention in the summer ? ?
&gt; to make the love interest a bit more viable, or was there some
&gt; other thinking behind the changes ? Are you prepared for the hero
&gt; worship that's going to abound at the convention ?

      I think Jerry has other commitments...

      As for the pilot, initially Delenn was going to be a male
Minbari who came out of the chrysalis female...but due to our inability
to modify Mira's voice enough to make it work, we dropped that aspect.

                                                                  jms
