       Okay, Mike...so the organization speaks for itself.  Over on
GEnie, George Martin came in, and speaking as Vice President for SFWA,
speaking for the *group*, said, of my statement to disqualify myself
from future Nebulas to show that this isn't part of a vested interest
on my part but rather the principle, "Don't you have enough awards,
Joe?"  When another fan reminded him of my statement given above, he
said, "You cannot disqualify yourself from a Nebula, and I suspect Joe
knew that."  (Which I didn't.)  In essense he first questions my
motives and my ethics, then assaults my honesty, as his way of dealing
with my raising the issue.  (I then made it plain that I will not 
accept any Nebula in future, regardless, if that's what it takes,
though I think most people knowing you don't want one will tend to
discourage voting in that area.)

       So now what is this, George speaking as George, or George
speaking for SFWA the organization?  Because when he came in he sure as
heck made it clear that he was speaking in his capacity as VP.

       Sorry, Mike, but the organization acts as its members act, and
speaks as its members speaks, and George's intemperate reaction, to
immediately and gratuitously go for the personal attack rather than
discussing the issue, when I had never said a WORD about any one person
in this discussion, just shows again why many are afraid to pursue this
issue any more.  They're tired of the petty, personal attacks, and so
am I, from many of the members AND the organization and its
spokespersons.  Because an organization doesn't exist as some kind of
Platonic ideal, outside reality (though in this I sometimes wonder if
SFWA is outside reality).  It says in the Bible, "You shall know them
by their works."  An organization is known by what it does, and what
it says, through its members.  So you can try and divorce the two all
you want, but they're the same thing.

                                                                  jms
