<pre> Kirk R. Darling &lt;73063.3115@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; What would be the social status of a Minbari who was known to be
&gt; a descendent of Valen? What does that mean in terms of the racial
&gt; purity issue? Would general knowledge of Delenn as a descendent of
&gt; Valen help her or hurt her on the Gray Council (racial impurity
&gt; versus descendency from the One)? Did the other members of the
&gt; Gray Council understand the significance of the glowing
&gt; Triluminary (yes, I saw the astonishment on their faces, but that
&gt; might only have been surprise at the phenomenom)? Was Dukhat a
&gt; descendent of Valen? Is it now known among at least the Gray
&gt; Council that Valen was Sinclair?

      No, Dukhat was not descended from Valen; yes, the Grey Council
now knows who Sinclair was; and general knowledge of what happened
would certainly have an upsetting effect on Minbari society, so they
will continue to keep it indefinitely back-roomed....

                                                                  jms
