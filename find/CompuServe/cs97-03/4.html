      Thanks.  I've seen just about every article on CTS that I can
think of, and I've got it down to a roar...sometimes it's worse than
other times.  The Kinesis ergonomic keyboard at work helps, and I just
sent out for a Datahand keyboard to use at home to see if that helps
further.  It aches pretty much all the time, but it's a low, dull ache
and I'm hardly aware of it most of the time.  It's only when I go to
bed, and I'm still for more than 5 minutes at a time, that it really
starts to demand my attention.

      It was *much* worse last year or so, when I had to literally
write for 20 minutes, ice down my hands/wrists for 20 minutes, write
for 20, ice for 20, on and on.  I actually haven't had to do that this
year.

      (And yes, when I remember to do so, I use the wrist braces.)

                                                                  jms
