<pre> WizOp Wes Meier &lt;76703.747@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; at work, at home, and at play"?
&gt; That sorta, kinda, leaves us out in the cold, eh?

      Related question, Wes:  When a conference is promoted at the
opening menu, does it bring in a substantial number of folks who are
not *already* members of the forum?  I was just thinking that folks not
into SF likely would not show up for a conference with an SF type...and
those into SF are likely already aware of it from the on-site notice. 
Just curious.

                                                                  jms
