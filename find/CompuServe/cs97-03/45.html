<pre> Scott Baker &lt;76072.1744@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; And Netter digital does the Special Effects, right?
&gt; So what else does Netter Digital do?

       NDEI has its own projects under development, was involved in
the Battleground Earth project with Majel Roddenberry, produces the
occasional documentary (such as the Wild West documentary a couple
years ago), and other projects which don't involve me at all.

                                                                  jms
