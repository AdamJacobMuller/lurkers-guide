<pre> Dave Vincent &lt;75460.1133@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Could you identify this ship?
&gt; Is this the case?

      There was the Prometheus, which was there; and others, including
the Amundsen.  The one you saw, which looks a bit like the Aggy but
without the rotating section, is another, smaller class of destroyer
also seen, I believe, in "Dreams."

                                                                  jms
