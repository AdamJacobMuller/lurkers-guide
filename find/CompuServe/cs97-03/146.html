       I've found it's generally best to *see* what one does before
deciding whether not to be disappointed by it.  And I really have no
interest in running the story by anyone for approval or to make sure
they think it'll be okay, and along the way destroy any possible
interest in *seeing* it since the story is already out there on the
nets.

                                                                  jms
