<pre> Kirk R. Darling &lt;73063.3115@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Yes, but why did you give Ducat hair (a beard)?
&gt; Is it possible, BTW, that the "transformation" for Delenn worked
&gt; more thoroughly than the other Minbari realize because it had
&gt; some human DNA already in Delenn's cells to build on? And judging
&gt; from the stunned expressions on the faces of the other Gray
&gt; Council members when the trilumenary glowed, did they understand
&gt; that significance, and do any others now on Minbar? Finally, I beg
&gt; for a hint...will this information have any future bearing on the
&gt; plot, or is it merely "nice to know" data?

      Yeah, the human DNA definitely helped...and overall, this isn't
so much the arc as the overall story and history.  It's filling out the
world.

                                                                  jms
