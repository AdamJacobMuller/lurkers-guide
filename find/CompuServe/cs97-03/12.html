<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;75063.3305@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Does this mean that Dukhat (and any leader of the Minbari people)
&gt; is also on the Grey Council? Was Valen the first leader of the
&gt; Minbari people in the history of the Grey Council? Or is it
&gt; possible that this vacancy in the Nine was the one that Delenn
&gt; later filled? Or am I reading this in the wrong way?
&gt; Can you help me understand this a little better, please?

      There's the One, and the Nine...when Dukhat was alive, there
were 9 grey council members and him as the head of it, making ten. 
(Look at the picture and count the number of people.)  1 and 9.

      Valen called together the Grey Council, formed the first one;
until then the castes had been in constant competition.  He wanted to
operate outside of that a bit, so he made sure he was not one of the
Nine.  That tradition has continued.

                                                                  jms
