<pre> Douglas Piligian &lt;70760.2440@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Just wondering, what, if anything, was involved in using the song
&gt; from Pirates of Penzance that Marcus was singing at the end?

      Nothing, really...we just grabbed one of the audio bits from the
day's filming and dropped it in.

                                                                  jms
