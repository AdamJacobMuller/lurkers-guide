<H2>Who cares about truth?</H2>
<h3>Date: 11 Mar 1997 14:43:01 -0700</h3>
<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;75063.3305@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; And, even if love wasn't motivation enough for her to come clean
&gt; with her life, shouldn't truth be? What the hell has she been
&gt; fighting for all this time? But truth doesn't apply to her?
&gt; Was it all just a convenient lie to her?

      Ah, but Minbari never tell anyone the whole truth....
