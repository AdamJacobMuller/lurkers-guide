<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; I wonder who I should report this rule violation to?

      That is kinda funny, since I was sent a private message here a
month or two ago by, I believe, Chaffee, chiding me for using the term
"pain in the ass" in a public forum...and here that word is used in a
Member Services announcement.

      I guess that means that they can't promote the Member Services
Announcements in the Member Services Announcements section anymore.

                                                                  jms
