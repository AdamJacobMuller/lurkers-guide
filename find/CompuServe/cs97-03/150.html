      Actually, there'd be no rush at all in terms of getting a sequel
into prep and out the door.  The discussions now are in the area of
fall 97 to shoot and January 98 to air (with or without a simultaneous
S5 of B5).  We have a lot of the stuff we'd need for the sequel
(costumes, uniforms, some sets, prosthetics, that sort of thing), so
the lead time would be very short.

                                                                  jms
