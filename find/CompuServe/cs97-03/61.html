<pre> Douglas Piligian &lt;70760.2440@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Does it glow brighter if there is more of the DNA present?
&gt; did it glow really bright when held up to Sinclair after he was
&gt; captured at the Battle of the Line? Did they know at that time
&gt; that it only glowed in the presence of Valen's DNA? ever get your
&gt; ISDN modem to work?

       Yeah, we showed it glowing when Sinclair was catpured.  Since
it happened with Valen, they assumed it was because he had a Minbari
soul, maybe Valen reborn.

                                                                  jms
