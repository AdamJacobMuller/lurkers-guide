<pre> Scott Baker &lt;76072.1744@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Doesn't he suspect to some degree?
&gt; He knows she was on the Grey Council, he knows she knows about
&gt; Sinclair, isn't there the possibility he'll put 2 and 2 together? 
&gt; Also, doesn't she to some degree want forgiveness from him for
&gt; her part in the war?

      The reality is...in war, one does what one does.  Afterward, as
we heal, we try to forget what we did, and what they did.  He killed as
many Minbari as he could; she was on the Grey Counci that directed the
war.  One doesn't go into it.

                                                                  jms
