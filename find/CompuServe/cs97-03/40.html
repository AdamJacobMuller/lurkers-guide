       Yeah, that's the problem...it has to be one or the other
Family, or Adult...and if you have any content that ain't kid-approved
it automatically puts you in the latter category, which lots of people
don't want for all the reasons you cite.  Something here don't make a
whole lot of sense....

                                                                  jms
