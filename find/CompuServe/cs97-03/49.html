<pre> Bob Koslosky &lt;102365.2062@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Those ships that showed up just before the humans attacked, where
&gt; Delenn said something to the effect that they only showed up when
&gt; death was near - who were those guys?

       Those were Soul Hunters, who in the first season we learned
showed up to attempt to grab Dukhat's soul...they were prevented from
successfully boarding the ship by the Minbari, who threw up a wall of
bodies to stop them (which is why there were few around with Delenn and
Dukhat; Soul Hunters are a pretty advanced sort, the terror of Minbari,
and it took a lot to stop them). After Dukhat died, Delenn went down
and joined in, confronting them about this.

                                                                  jms
