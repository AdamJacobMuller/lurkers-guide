       I agree 100%.  One of the things I've been ragging on for years
is that you should bring in SF writers to work on SF shows.  Real
simple logic. But the perception there is that SF print authors can't
deal with, or are disdainful of, scripts...something SFWA perpetuated
when many of their members said they (as a group) wouldn't be able to
make sense of a script.

       There are some terrific resources out there who would be
invaluable to any SF series.  That's why I gave Peter David his first
shot at a live action TV series, ditto for Christy Marx and others.

                                                                  jms
