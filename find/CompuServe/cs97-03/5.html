<pre> Toni Muller &lt;75223.1575@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Does what we (and a few Minbari) now know about the triluminaries
&gt; glowing in response to human DNA necessarily negate the theory of
&gt; the "Minari Soul Train"? Will Delenn ever tell John the truth?
&gt; What's going on with Delenn's/Mira's hair?

      We keep working on Mira's hair...some days it's better than
others.

                                                                  jms
