<pre> Trent K. Johnson &lt;71020.1052@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is this something to do with a different editing process, or does
&gt; it relate to the change in satellite delivery?

       I'm afraid I don't know what elements you're referring to, so I
can't answer that offhand.  On the rest...thanks.

                                                                  jms
