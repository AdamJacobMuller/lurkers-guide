<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;75063.3305@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Does Sheridan know that Delenn was Satai?

      Well, Sheridan knows that Delenn was Grey Council, so he would
obviously know she was Satai, since that's pretty much the same thing.

                                                                  jms
