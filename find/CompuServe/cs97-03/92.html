<H2>jms in Orlando</H2>
<h3>Date: 10 Mar 1997 16:25:06 -0700</h3>
<pre>      Just to advise those in the Orlando area...I'll be at Megacon at
the Orange County Convention Center thereabouts, giving my B5
presentation on Saturday at 3:00 p.m., with scenes from shows not yet
aired, bloopers, and other sundry stuff.  I *think* there's also an
autograph thing afterward, but can't be sure offhand.

                                                                  jms
