<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;75063.3305@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; So, am I correct in my memory that you said Delenn changed castes
&gt; when she was young? If so, what was her family's original caste?

       No, Delenn never changed castes.

                                                                  jms
