      Give Wes some time...he has restored the messages, and is
currently in the position of reconsidering the situation regarding the
rules themselves, and what actually applies within those rules.  I
think we should be willing to give him the room to do so without an
immediate deadline, since he has made a good faith effort here.

                                                                  jms
