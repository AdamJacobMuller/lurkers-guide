<pre> Douglas Piligian &lt;70760.2440@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Hasn't Delenn learned her lesson about telling the truth, all of
&gt; it, to Sheridan? Are we seeing a return of the old Delenn?

       Certainly Delenn has some hard things to do coming up.

                                                                  jms
