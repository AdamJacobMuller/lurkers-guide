<pre> Kirk R. Darling &lt;73063.3115@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Leguin's _Left Hand of Darkness_?

      No, but I know the story...and the idea there is of a race that
changes sex.  Minbari do not change sex as a rule, it was going to be a
one-off with Delenn.

                                                                  jms
