      You should've come up and said hello, I didn't know you were
there.

      Re: the look on my face...it's a sad thing, but at 42 years old,
having lived the life I've led, and done the things I've done, part of
me is very iconoclastic and brash, but there's a part of me that's
still about 12 years old and shy and...okay, I blush.  Easily.  It's
*really* embarrassing.  (Some women tell me it's cute, which is even
MORE embarrassing.)

      And yeah, Narns are marsupial, but since Andreas keeps referring
to himself otherwise, I used it.

      And the commune story...is WAY too long to tell.

                                                                  jms
