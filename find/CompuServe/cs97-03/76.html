<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; But B5 fans?

"My respect for fans would ratchet yet higher if it turns out that
more than 350 of them can keep a secret .... especially online.  I
can't imagine saying to 350 mundanes "This is just between you and me
..."

      Here's the amazing thing.

      From time to time at cons, I'll decide to tell a story that for
one reason or another I want kept off the nets.  And I'll say to the
audience, please oblige me on this one.

      I've done this about a dozen times, in front of audiences as
large as 2,000 people.

      And y'know what?

      As far as I can remember, not once has anyone broken that
agreement.

      Anybody wants to badrap the fans, I tell 'em that...and it sets
them straight real fast.

                                                                  jms
