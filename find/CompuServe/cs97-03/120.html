"It's a looooooong jump from that to saying that SFWA 'doesn't
consider screenwriters real writers.'"

      Ah.

      So, I take it that the letters that appeared in the SFWA Journal
from SFWA members stating essentially that point did not actually exist
in our universe, having instead filtered over via some spatial rift
from the Bizarro Universe version of SFWA...(which would frankly be
redundent).

                                                                  jms
