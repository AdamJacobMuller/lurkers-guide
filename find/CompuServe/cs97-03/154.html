<pre> R. Thomas &lt;71544.3171@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Am I correct in my understanding that the 6 first ones' ships
&gt; Lorien brought out were from species from this particular galaxy,
&gt; but that had already gone beyond the rim, and do not reside in
&gt; the galaxy at all? If so, will the walkers still appear in normal
&gt; space around sigma 957 from time to time?

      They were all still hanging around here, for one reason or
another, mostly to do with inertia, familiarity...but finally
recognized that it was time.

                                                                  jms
