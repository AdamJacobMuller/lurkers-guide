<pre> Scott Baker &lt;76072.1744@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; As to the SFWA, is there anything that we, the fans can do to
&gt; help you win this crusade?

      Thanks...and as for SFWA, it's an internal matter that they will
have to consider on their own.

                                                                  jms
