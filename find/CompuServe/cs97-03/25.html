<pre> ben dibble &lt;105430.3170@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; What then is the deciding factor as to whose memories are
&gt; experienced by all present? Is it whoever "allows" themselves to
&gt; be drawn into the experience, who wills it to happen to them?

         I think the order or dominance of the drug is probably
determined by the contents of the script....
