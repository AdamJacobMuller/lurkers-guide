"Think it'll happen though?"

      When hasn't it?

      I've been told I'm a jerk before, will be in future; and in a
sense, your message wondering if my actions were right was implicitly
implying a potential state of Jerk...and that's okay.

      You're wrong, of course....

                                                                  jms
