      I'd be hard to pick an absolute favorite; I like all of them,
for various reasons, and at various times.  If you put a gun to my
head, I'd say it was probably either Delenn or Londo, because of the
many shades to their characters.  They're like crystals, they change
color and texture depending on how the light shines through them.

                                                                  jms
