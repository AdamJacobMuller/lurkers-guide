<pre> Catherine Becic &lt;73414.2603@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Does that mean that snail mail people are out of luck?
&gt; Do you also respond to those?

      I try to reply to snail mail as I can, though it's certainly
easier to do so in email.

                                                                  jms
