<H2>Was this Delenn?</H2>
<h3>Date: 09 Mar 1997 22:33:49 -0700</h3>
<pre> Craig M. Bobchin &lt;102354.3246@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Funny, ain't it...?
&gt; I was wondering if you've yet sprung the off beat plot turn on us
&gt; yet, and if so was it one of the transformations? If not is this
&gt; still on the books to be done? If it was and not one of the
&gt; transformations what was it?

      The off-beat notion was Delenn going from male to female, and
then having a relationship with the CO.

                                                                  jms
