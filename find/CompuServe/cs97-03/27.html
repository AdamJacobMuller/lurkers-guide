<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Did you already have him pictured in your head?
&gt; Did it make casting easier?
&gt; Who designed them?

      Actually, that was Dukhat, and yeah, that's pretty close to how
I saw him in my head.  Definitely a bigger than life fellow.

                                                                  jms
