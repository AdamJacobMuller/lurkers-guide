<pre>{original post had no questions}

      I saw a piece in one of the comics publications the other day,
might've been Comics Buyers Guide or the like...apparently unopened
boxes of the first B5 set are going for $150 each, originally $35 or
so.  Not bad....

                                                                  jms
