<H2>I-con: Time of Program?</H2>
<h3>Date: 31 Mar 1997 13:52:30 -0700</h3>
<pre> Eric Baker &lt;76600.2605@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; What time are you doing the B5 presentation at I-con?

       I don't have the schedule with me at the moment, but it's
mid-afternoon Saturday...though there is a second presentation on
Sunday, apparently.

                                                                  jms
