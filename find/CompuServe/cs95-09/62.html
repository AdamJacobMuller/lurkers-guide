<pre>     Thanks.  There does seem this odd rule that when a new viewer tries out 
the show for the first time, it's invariably one of our few dorky shows; but 
if you stick around, the next one is usually dead-on.

     What do *I* want?  To finish this story.

                                                                  jms
