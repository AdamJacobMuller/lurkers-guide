<pre>     Actually, much of what's been reported is misconception or 
actors who somewhat...misremember things.

     Bill was never considered a one-shot as Lennier.  It was always 
a recurring role.  That's what we put out in the casting breakdowns 
that went to agents, and that was the understanding when we did 
auditions, and when we negotiated with Bill, and did the main 
titles.

     Pat Tallman's character was *never* intended as a male; at one 
time, I'd considered making Delenn male to start with, then female 
after emerging from the chrysalis, but Lyta...never.

     So there really hasn't been as much divergence as might seem.

                                                       jms
