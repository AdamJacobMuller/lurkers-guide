<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: September 04, 1995 10:16:24 PM</h3>
<pre>     New sets: yes, and we're creating situations in which we can see more of
Earth, Mars, our other local planets, plus Narn, Centauri, Minbari and one
other major world.  As the Shadow War cranks into gear, you're going to need
a place to meet in security and plan for it, so we're also building that.
We'll see more of Draal's place on Epsilon 3.  And there's one other major
set that we'll see in the first episode, and quite a bit thereafter.

     New characters: well, there's Marcus Cole, a Ranger assigned permanently
to Babylon 5, played by British actor Jason Carter; we'll see Lyta Alexander
more this year; and Theo...what can I say about Theo...well, perhaps better
to let you see for yourself.

                                                                       jms
