<H2> 3rd Season opener...		</H2>
<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: September 28, 1995 11:50:07 PM</h3>
<pre>&lt;Rumor is the 3rd season opener will feature Lord Refa going insane when Londo
slips him hash-filled brownies.  And it's called, "Refa Madness."&gt;

      I won't comment on a joke I told you first....

      We must now go to the WGA and arbitrate this.

                                                                       jms
