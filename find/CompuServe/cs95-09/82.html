<pre>     Except, of course, that there wasn't "a quick directional change by
offering a new enemy" (in second season) because that enemy - the Shadows --
was in there right from the git-go, in season one...in "Chrysalis," which we
shot #12 even though it was aired #22 as our cliffhanger, and in "Signs and
Portents," short shortly thereafter.  So it was always there, and has always
been there...they're the primary antagonist, in a philosophical sense,
throughout a major part of the story.

     "...and the mutation of another primary character."  This, also, was in
the outline of the story from the very first episode onward; it's
*important* to the story, and wasn't done for any of the reasons you cite.
(The only change here was that Delenn was originally planned to be a male
character, if androgynous, which emerged female from the chrysalis, but we
couldn't get the male-altered voice to sound right, so this was dropped,
though we kept the more-human aspects.)

     You seem to determine "the maturity of the show" by not offering real
or substantive changes; but this show is *about* change, and the choices we
make that create those changes.  There's this notion that if someone's the
captain, he has to stay the captain all the time; which is the element that
many ST fans criticize in TNG as to why Riker stayed first-officer for seven
years, which would kill any other career.

     So it's not a reset, it's an advancement of the storyline...look at
Londo as we first saw him, and now; ditto for G'Kar...we're talking here
major, substantive changes.  That aspect is at the very core of the story.
You really can't look at this as you would a regular episodic drama in that
one respect; "Oh, they just changed characters, so they're just starting all
over again."  That's not the intent at all.

     "the show (TNG) stayed with its basic core of characters and followed a
similar structure...B5 episodes seem to detract from this formula."  Which
is precisely the intent.  I don't like formula, or predictability, or to
lock down a structure and never change it...that's not life, and I try to
make this show emulate life.  People change, die, get promoted, demoted,
transferred, corrupted, redeemed...change, for me, is the *drama* of the
story; to stay static and unchanging the reverse of that.  It's *process*,
and I find process fascinating.

     "I guess patience is a virtue."  Well, I have to say that if you're
waiting for B5 to settle down into a predictable, unchanging formula, you're
going to have a long wait ahead of you, because that's not in the cards. The
changes and developments only pick up greater speed and ramifications the
deeper we go into the storyline.

     (PS...as for "all or some of the credit" for the new SF shows going to
ST, much as one might wish that were true, it isn't.  Otherwise you'd've had
a lot more of them in the last 30 years.  I've been in meetings with network
and studio execs, and one reason it took us 5 years to sell B5 was because,
as we were told verbatim, "There's no market in TV for SF other than Trek;
the market won't sustain more than one SF show like that; people don't want
SF, they want ST."  It was used, repeatedly, to justify why you couldn't do
these kinds of shows...and I'd point out that B5 is the FIRST SF show in 30
years, since ST, to be set in the far future, with mankind as a spacefaring
civilization, and with a fully worked out cosmology of other races,
politics, and governments...and particularly one of the very few to go past
two seasons in general.  Now you're getting more SF on the air because the
networks have finally seen that ST does NOT have a death-grip on TV SF, and
other shows, like B5 and X-Files *can* survive.

     (Certainly it was never ST's intent for this to happen, and I'm not
saying that it is or was; but this has definitely been the result, and the
ST shadow has been something for other SF shows to overcome; it has not made
the process easier, only more difficult.  How many American-made space SF
series have gone past 3 seasons other than ST?  It's after 4 seasons that
the networks/studios begin making back their money, and since the answer to
that is "virtually none," you begin to see why they've been reluctant to do
more than stick their toes in over the last three decades.)
