<pre>     Harlan is a *huge* fan of Pinky and the Brain.  As it happens, I know
the actor who does one of the two voices (I can never remember if he's Pinky
or the Brain...I think the Brain...Maurice LeMarche), and had him call Harlan
as his character.  They did competing Brains.

                                                                       jms
