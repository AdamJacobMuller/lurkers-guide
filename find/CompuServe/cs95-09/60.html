<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: September 25, 1995 10:34:18 PM</h3>
<pre>&lt;1.  Will the WB-Turner merger affect you and B5?

2.  Will we see Sarah (General Hague's messanger) again, or is Live Shot 
taking all of Wanda De Jesus' time?

3.  Rewatching All Alone in the Dark last night,rom:  J. Michael Straczynski, 71016,1644#345687

     I haven't actually gotten a copy of that issue of Foundation yet; are 
there any other articles or essays in it mentioning B5?  I sent James an 
email, but so far, no reply, on getting a copy.

                                                        jms

     (First time I ever wrote for a nominally "literary" publication; 
hope I didn't come off as too much of a doofus.)
