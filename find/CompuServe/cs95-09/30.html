<pre>     What, I should begin catering to prurient interests?  
Broadcasting picture postcards (likely French) of Vorlons 
in provocative poses, in lingerie?  A terrible thing, that 
a nice young man such as yourself should be asking about.  
Does your mother know you're out here doing this?  Good 
heavens.

     And who said they reproduce anymore?
