<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: September 01, 1995 11:01:18 PM</h3>
<pre>&lt;During the battle in Fall of Night, when that part of the station 
gets shot off, what exactly is that thing anyway?&gt;

     It's an area for helping secure ships while being offloaded 
into the zero-G cargo bay right behind it.
