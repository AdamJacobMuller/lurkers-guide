<pre>     "He was nasty to the people in the crowd who tried to support ST.  He
literally tried to make them look like idiots and talked them down."

     I'm sorry, Lisa...I hate to say you're exaggerating, or being less than
truthful, but this never happened.  I don't know if you're remembering it
this way out of some defensiveness, but this never happened, and there were
plenty of other people at that panel who can confirm this.

     I have made it a very deliberate point, in any public appearance, not
to put down *anyone* for watching ST.  Never have, never will.  I don't know
if you're attributing comments made by others to me, or simply going off
your emotions of that panel, but it never happened.  I know that Shane
Shellenbarger (noted SF fan/writer based in Arizona) was there that day
videotaping the panel, and I'll drop him a note asking to check the tape and
verify this.

     (I also remember very distinctly at that panel that I kept trying to
change the topic to non-B5 shows, but kept getting yanked back to it by the
other panelists and the audience...in large part because a) I wanted some
info on the other shows, and b) I didn't want to blow the info that I'd come
to use at the big presentation at a small panel, thus eliminating any sense
of drama and becoming redundent.)

                                                                       jms
