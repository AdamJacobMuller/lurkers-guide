<H2> B5 Story Line Static?		</H2>
<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: September 12, 1995 11:02:16 PM</h3>
<pre>     I'd be a fool not to build in trap doors all over the place, so that
the story can continue no matter what happens to individuals...in the same
way that the story of WW II continued, even though some lived and some died
before the end.

                                                                       jms
