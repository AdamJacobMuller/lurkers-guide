<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: September 10, 1995 4:25:25 PM</h3>
<pre>     Thanks.  Characters, for me, are the point of a novel, and 
any good story.  Long after the plot becomes fuzzy in memory, you 
remember the people...you remember Ahab and Michael Valentine Smith 
and Charles Dexter Ward....

     Re: not having adjective/adverb disease...there's something 
funny there you wouldn't know about.  See, when I was in high school, 
they had Career Day for the tops in various areas (dance, acting, 
athletics, whatever).  I ended up in the Writing group.  It was held at 
Southwestern College down by San Diego.  I was stuck in this little 
room, and nobody came by, because who wants to see writers when you can 
see athletes and dancers and mimes?

     Finally, a short fellow with salt-and-pepper hair wandered in, 
and went down the line of manuscripts-with-writers, paused at my table.  
(I was writing stories in the Lovecraft/dark horror vein at the time.)  
Took one of my stories, walked off, sat in one of the lawn chairs, 
read it through. Came back, returned the story, took another.  Read that 
one over.  Put it back.  Looked at me for a long moment.

     Then he said: "You have a great and substantial talent for your age. 
Two pieces of advice: one, don't ever let them stop you from telling the 
stories you want to tell; two, cut every third adjective."

     Then he walked off, and as soon as he was out the door, the faculty 
advisor came running at me at warp nine.  "What did he say, what did he say, 
whatdidhesay?"  I told her.  "Don't you know who that was?" she asked.

     I said no, though there was something kinda familiar about him, and 
remember it's always different when you see somebody out of context.  
"That was Rod Serling," she said, "he's here to speak at the college later 
today."

     Had there been a gun within easy reach, I would almost certainly have 
put a bullet into my brain.  By the time I ran out, he was gone.

     That was one of three weirdnesses in my life involving Rod.  
The other two...are stories for another day.

     So when you say I've managed to keep the adjectives down...
I'm very pleased.
