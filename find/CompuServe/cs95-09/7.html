<pre>     The B5 baseball cap is available by phone order from Creation 
Entertainment or at any Creation convention.

     As for the sound mix...yeah, we put a great deal of work into 
that aspect, for the surround effect.  If you fire up "Race" there's 
a LOT going on in that one.  It takes a great deal of time, but it's 
worth it.
