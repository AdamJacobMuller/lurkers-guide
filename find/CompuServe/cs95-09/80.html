<H2> Wolf 359 Update 1995/96		</H2>
<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: September 30, 1995 1:03:27 AM</h3>
<pre>     Ah, Brian...now that you've appeared in public, allow me to give you one
good-natured, but quite solid thump to the head.

     Remember when we were leaving the hotel the morning after the
convention, and you and your associate gave Kathryn and myself two wrapped
gift boxes?  Well, as you recall, we were in a hurry, so we thanked you
politely, put them in our bags (carry on only, no check through), and
hurried to the waiting cab.

     We got to the airport, and were about to go through the scanners, when
we remembered the boxes.  First rule of international travel: no matter WHO
gives you a package, always open it before going on board, because they'll
ask you.  So we opened the two boxes.

     Which contained letter openers.  About half a foot long.  Reasonably
sharp.

     In other words....KNIVES!  We were about to go into an international
airline with KNIVES in our carry-on bags.

     Do you know, Brian...can you *imagine* the hassle those knives cost us
on the flight?  The conferences with security, the long explanations, the
checking and cross-checking of passports, the knives taken away by security,
then returned in the plane later...then going through the whole thing all
over again at the stop-over in Chicago...having to provide passport and
other ID, getting a Chicago airline security person who happened to know the
show to vouch for me and sign the knives back over to us....

     We had such *splendid* things to say about you during all this, Brian.
You should've heard them.  We were half-tempted to leave the bloody things
at the terminal.  You may want to tell your people next time to THINK before
they give someone a package for international travel.  I can just imagine
what would've happened if we HADN'T checked the boxes before going through
the scanners.  "Are you carrying any weapons or any kind?"  "Nope."  "Then
would you care to explain these items, sir?"  CLANG!  They'd throw away the
key.

     That said...if you're still up for having me at the Encounter,
depending on terms and times, I'm up for it.

     But please...no parting gifts....

                                                                       jms
