<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: September 28, 1995 9:34:22 PM</h3>
<pre>     I often work on more than one thing at the same time; on B5, in
addition to the producing jobs, I'm outlining one script, writing another,
editing a third....

     Prior to B5 (which is all-consuming), I'd often be in somewhat lower
pressure jobs (standard writer/producer, not exec), and would be writing the
episodes, plus a novel, plus stories, plus a screenplay, plus other stuff,
all pretty much at the same time.

     The key, though, is to FINISH what you write.  Otherwise it's useless.

                                                                       jms

     P.S.  You misspelled "weird."
