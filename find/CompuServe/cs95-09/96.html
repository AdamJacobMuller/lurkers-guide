<pre>     Thanks.  Yes, there's a WW II parallel, not in terms of 
justifying one or the other -- one can make compelling 
arguments for and against the use of atomic weapons to close 
the war, but I leave it to those who were there to have 
made the right decision, because they had to live with it -- 
but in terms of strategy and wartime logic.
