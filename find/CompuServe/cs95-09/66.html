<pre>     Actually, we make as sure as possible that every episode contains the
information required to follow it; any needed background is restated or
contained within the episode.  You can see some, all or any other number of
episodes and be able to follow them...in some countries, they're running the
show *completely* out of order, except by season overall, and it seems to be
doing okay.

                                                                       jms
