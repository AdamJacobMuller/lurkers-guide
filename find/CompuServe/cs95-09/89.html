<pre>&lt;"The Hokey Pokey" dates back to slavery; is its use in "A Voice in the
Wilderness" related to that?&gt;

      I've actually heard several variations on what the song means; my guess
is that the real origins have been so reinterpreted and made-up over time that
we may never know the actual basis...what you heard is as valid as just about
anything else.

                                                                       jms
