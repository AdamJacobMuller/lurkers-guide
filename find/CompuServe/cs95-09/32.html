<pre>     What's this fascination with underoos and sheets and uncut 
something or others...?

     Have you started rooming with Daniel or something?

     Sigh...y'know, I remember when this was a clean place to 
hang out, kids could play in the streets, mothers could take 
their babies out in strollers, you could hang out on the front 
stoop and talk to people...now it's all underoos and nudie 
cutie Vorlon pictures.

     What's the world coming to?
