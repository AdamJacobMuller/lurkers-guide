<pre>     I approached the show with great hopes, but have stopped watching.  
It just stretches credulity; this is a nationally famous photographer...
have they eliminated/co-opted his publisher?  Every bookstore in the 
country that carries his books (which doubtless also have his photo), 
every library, every person who's ever seen his work, sent 
him a letter...it's just too big and too improbable.
