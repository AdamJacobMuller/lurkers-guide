<pre>     Ellen: thanks.  As for the episode in question, it's entitled "Point of
No Return," and the role of Lady Morella was written specifically for Majel.
I hustled to get it finished prior to the Wolf 359 convention, where I gave
her a copy of the script.  She read it overnight, and fell in love with the
story, the character, and what it was going to do with and to the BABYLON 5
universe (to wit: start turning it upside down).  Next morning, she said
"I'm in." And she is.

     Yes, it's a jms script, and is one of the most pivotal of this season,
episode #9, which with the one before it, "Messages from Earth," builds to a
major turning point in #10, so it should be a very popular, intense and
memorable episode in every respect.

                                                                       jms
