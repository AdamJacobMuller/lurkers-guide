<h3>Section: Star Trek<br>Date: September 30, 1995 10:31:31 PM</h3>
<pre>     Thanks.  What's compelling, for me, is that the reason the original
Star Trek worked so well is that the actors did a great job portraying those
characters...and ended up becoming tagged as being those characters, so in
the long run were hurt because they couldn't get other work.  But they were
able to make these characters work so well *because they were terrific
actors*.  So if you give a Walter Koenig or others another kind of role,
they'll do just as excellent a job with that as with what went before.

     So the part for Majel will, as stated, be quite different.

     Glad you like the final four; "Inquisitor" is also very much a favorite
of ours, and even though it has far fewer effects than the episodes on
either side of it, lots of folks here consider it possibly our best episode.
And yes, the impact of "Twilight" is pretty much what you describe...just
sort of a stunned silence, and lots of people have said they didn't want to
talk about it for a while afterward, being very moved by it.

     Re: the decision to hold back the final 4...creatively, it was a pain
in the ass, because I wanted them out in July, so people could consider the
implications.  But WB felt that it would give us a leg up on the third
season debut, let us build some momenum with 9 eps in a row rather than just
6-7.  There's an element of truth to that.  So I guess it's a wash....

                                                                        jms
