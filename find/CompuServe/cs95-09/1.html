<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: September 01, 1995 1:13:02 PM</h3>
<pre>     Simplest way to tell: if it has the PTEN copyright notice, it's 
usually authorized, same for any other product by other shows.  If 
not, not.

     One-offs, paintings of characters, that's one thing, but if 
somebody's selling mass-produced stuff like links, PPGs, patches 
without any kind of ID on them, you can be sure it ain't legit.
