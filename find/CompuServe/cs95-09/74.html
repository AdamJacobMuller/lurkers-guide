<pre>      Yeah, "Messages from Earth" came out quite well as a script; can't
wait for it to roll before the cameras.

      As it happens, episodes 8, 9 and 10 ("Messages," "Point of No Return,"
and "Severed Dreams") are kind of a triptych, linked at the hip and designed
to pull together/blow out several major hanging plot threads once and for
all, and send the show spinning off in an entirely different direction.  The
hardest one to write was 10, because it's a very emotional episode for the
characters, and for me.

      And next is #11, which I begin to write this weekend...and #11, year
three, is the *exact* midpoint of the 5 year story.  This is the hump, the
dead center of the journey.  It took so long to get here, and suddenly we're
halfway finished.

                                                                       jms
