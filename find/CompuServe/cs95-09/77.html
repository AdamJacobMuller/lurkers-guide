<pre>     Re: "No Mrs. Troi on B5," I remember the comments when we mentioned for
the first time that we'd have Walter Koenig on the show.  "Oh, lord, Chekov
on B5."  Then they met his character, Mr. Bester...and nobody said that no
more.  He instantly became one of our more popular, interesting characters.

     The role Majel's going to do for us is very different than what she's
done before...otherwise, what's the point?

                                                                       jms
