<pre>     There are limits to what the healing device can do, for starters; 
it can't repair physical damage to the body, mainly it works with 
disease and basic low-energy stuff; also, bear in mind that it was a 
device used for *capital punishment*...meaning that to save one person's 
life, another must sacrifice his or her own, if it's that far along, 
so it's not really something you can trot out everytime somebody gets 
nailed.
