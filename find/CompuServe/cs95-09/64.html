<H2> Major B5/ST News			</H2>
<h3>Section: Star Trek<br>Date: September 28, 1995 12:46:11 AM</h3>
<pre>     Before you hit the *kill* button...a thought or two in your general
direction.  First, if you're eager for the actual news part of this message
-- and it is kinda important -- it appears at the end of this message.  If
you've got a second, stick around.

     In every interview he's given on the subject, Walter Koenig has spoken
glowingly of BABYLON 5, as a show he feels is fighting for genuine quality
SF in television, with serious, mature stories for fans who grew up on STAR
TREK and are looking for more of that quality...none other than Majel
Barrett Roddenberry has gone on record at conventions, including Toronto
Trek and the recent Wolf 359 convention, as saying that BABYLON 5 was "the
only other intelligent science fiction series out there" besides the ST
shows, and urged ST fans to support it.

     If you've tried the show, and it wasn't to your tastes...fair enough.
No one should be expected to like everything.  If you'd like to give it
another shot, that's fine, but there is no need to defend your opinion; we
respect it.  Not every show works for every viewer.

     If you *haven't* tried the show...if you liked the original ST and the
work of Majel and Walter and Harlan and others involved in it...if you like
the work of Peter David, who has written for B5 and supports it...you may
want to give it a shot in October/November.

     The final four episodes from year two will be broadcast starting the
week of October 11th, with the new year three episodes beginning the second
week of November.  These nine episodes in a row contain some of the best
work we have ever done.  Acting, writing, directing, effects...we stand
behind all of them.  (The year two Final Four were held back from earlier
broadcast to lead into the debut, so these are new to the US, although they
have already aired to substantial praise in the UK.)

     If perhaps you have been turned off by some of the more vigorous
messages from B5 viewers, I'd only ask that you consider those comments in
light of the fact that Paramount (NOT the people doing ST, but the studio
itself) has done everything possible to hinder the progress of B5, which
engenders certain reactions from everyone; and that to a man or woman,
virtually all of the more vigorous posts have come from those who have long
considered themselves fans of STAR TREK, voicing many of the concerns which
are stated right here in this forum by current viewers...which they had long
before there was a B5...  as well as some of the praises found here.

     The ironic thing is that there is no problem between those who make B5,
and those who make ST..Jeri Taylor is a friend, Majel supports the show,
when ST does an episode with great EFX we call them, when we do a good one
they call us...it's almost entirely a matter of perception.

     So for what it's worth, direct from those of us who make BABYLON 5, if
you haven't checked out the show before, or if you're curious to see where
we stand now...I would like to personally invite you to check out the new
batch of episodes starting around October 11th.  If you want to give us all
nine episodes, that's great; if less, that's fine too.  If not at all,
that's also fine.

     Over a late dinner with Majel, I observed that after the original STAR
TREK, which for the first time presented truly *human* characters, with all
their flaws and frailties and bravery and nobility, in a science fiction
series, the ball was dropped, and no one picked it up again for years.  She
agreed with this...and it is my hope that you will find this coming season
of BABYLON 5 to be that show.

     Because it isn't an either/or, sum/zero game...one can watch, and
enjoy, BABYLON 5 and STAR TREK equally, for different reasons, since their
approaches are very different.  And this is the perfect time to come into
B5, since these episodes encapsulize a lot of background, and will take you
quickly into the background, the universe and the characters.

     Which is why, I'm pleased to announce, Majel Barrett will be appearing
as a guest star on BABYLON 5 this coming season...a gesture of support from
her, and a gesture of respect from all of us at B5.  The deal has been
signed, it's a done deal...she'll be appearing in episode #9, "Point of No
Return," as Emperor Turhan's third wife, Lady Morella.  We're very much
looking forward to her appearance in the B5 universe.

     For all these and other reasons, I hope you'll give BABYLON 5 a try.

                                                                       jms

     (P.S. For the Internet gang...please don't repost this on the 'net until
after Jeannette has broken the news; I promised I'd let her make the
announcement there, after she heard about it at Wolf 359 in the UK, and agreed
to keep this secret for the last week at my request.)
