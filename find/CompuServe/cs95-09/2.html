<pre>     Just so we're clear, the problem isn't getting WB moving on 
licensing; ever since we got started here, I've been dragging my 
feet on licensing stuff, because I've seen merchandising become the 
tail wagging the dog on TV shows.  I don't want that to happen 
here.  So as stuff comes in, I approve only a few things, selectively, 
that I think can be done, and done well.

     Re: the UK videotape situation...that's something that I have no 
input into whatsoever, as it falls under the jurisdiction of another 
country, and the approval steps are several steps removed from me.

                                                         jms
