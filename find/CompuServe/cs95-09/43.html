<pre>&lt;How many people there are in the world who have as much confirmation as you
do that they're doing with their lives what they were *meant* to do?&gt;

     I'm not sure some days if this is what I was *meant* to do...or if I'm
simply incompetent to do anything *else*....

                                                                       jms
