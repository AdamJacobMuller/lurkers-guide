<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: September 03, 1995 7:20:04 PM</h3>
<pre>     The Vorlons aren't yet ready; they can't take on the shadows by 
themselves, and must bring together other forces.

     And in each case, re: Kosh, what they saw was not the *head* of 
their belief, but in essence a supporting being of light; it wasn't 
G'Quon, but G'Lan that G'Kar saw, which was a being that story tells us 
served G'Quon. So you wouldn't see the head of the religion, 
since there can only be one of those, and lots of Vorlons, but each tends 
to have a supporting cast, for lack of a better term.  Those are what 
we perceive the vorlons to be.

     And remember, we didn't see any other human's POV of Kosh but 
Sheridan's.
