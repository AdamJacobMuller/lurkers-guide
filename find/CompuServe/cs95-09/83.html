<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: September 30, 1995 10:49:14 PM</h3>
<pre>     I don't tend to leave out things in my stories, particularly B5, as
much as morph them into something else if I feel it'd work better a
different way.  For any writer to be so hidebound to stick to every single
tiny element of the outline, once one is at the script stage (or the novel
writing stage) is foolish, and I can't think of anyone who doesn't diverge
to one degree or another.

     For me, an outline is basically a series of directions on a map; get
here, turn *right*, take highway 407 to here, get off and proceed south. But
if you get into a part of your trip, and suddenly see that there's a fork in
the road you hadn't anticipated that'll cut hours off your trip, you'd be
foolish not to take it.  Non-writers never understand that; they only see
the work when it's done, not the process, which is alien to them.

     If you make a course correction, you have to make sure everything still
tracks with your goal, natch, or risk getting lost along the way...but to
the "experience" part of your question...that's the instinct that keeps you
ever heading toward your destination.  That comes only with time.  And I've
been at this a LONG time.

                                                                       jms
