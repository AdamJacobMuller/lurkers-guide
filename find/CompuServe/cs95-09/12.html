<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: September 04, 1995 3:21:18 PM</h3>
<pre>     T-shirts are available from Creation and All-U, with caps and mugs from
Creation (and there's a GREAT new mug with the station on the obverse side),
along with a great jacket with the station embroidered on the back.  There
are 4 micromachine sets out now, with 2 more to come.  And the trading cards
from Fleer are due out in about a week or so.

                                                                       jms
