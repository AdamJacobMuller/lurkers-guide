<H2> Mira Furlan in LA Play		</H2>
<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: September 24, 1995 6:01:02 PM</h3>
<pre>     Mira Furlan, best known here as Ambassador Delenn, is currently 
starring in a production of Sophocles' classic play ANTIGONE.  This 
modernized version is directed by Mira's husband, Goran Gajic, and 
adapted by Deanne Stillman.  It's a chance to see Mira out of makeup, 
and in a very different kind of role than you've seen before.

     The play is currently running at the Hudson Guild Theater, 6543 
Santa Monica Boulevard, in Hollywood.  Performances are Thursdays-
Saturdays at 8 p.m., Sundays at 7.  Tickets can be acquired by 
calling 213-660-TKTS.
