<pre> Julie Mehta &lt;113367.1506@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Are there any more details in it about the devices that might be
&gt; useful to know?

"I agree the coldness was disturbing, but I feel this reveals the deep
emotion she feels at Byron's death and her consequent ruthless
determination to achieve his goals."

      This was the point I was going for with people who were saying
that the Byron thing was totally extraneous.  To get Lyta to this point
as a character -- remembering her "I'll sue" tirade as the last time
she even sorta kinda got mad -- she would *have* to go through the
fire, and lose something that meant enough to push her to this point. 
So you had to let the relationship with Byron go full term, follow it
over time, and see what it meant to her to justify and motivate what
happens to and with her in the last part of the season.

                                                                  jms
