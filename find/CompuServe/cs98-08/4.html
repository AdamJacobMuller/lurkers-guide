<pre> Michael Kalus &lt;100265.3065@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Why not the pilot?
&gt; Is the movie not in Widescreen available?
&gt; are already available for a Widescreen release?

"Why not the pilot? Is the movie not in Widescreen available?"

      Wasn't shot that way.

"Also I read somewhere that B5 has been broadcasted in Widescreen in
Portugal, does this mean that all the SFX etc. are already available
for a Widescreen release?"

      That's correct.

                                                                  jms
