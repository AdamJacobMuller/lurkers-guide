<pre> Philip Hornsey &lt;74053.2101@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; What...pray tell...is "The Shy Stegasaurus of Cricket Creek"?
&gt; Joe...did you write something "for kids"?
&gt; ...did you sell out?

      No, didn't sell out...it just came out looking a hell of a lot
cuter than I had been led to think, and it's kind of a cute
story...hell, it is what it is....

                                                                  jms
