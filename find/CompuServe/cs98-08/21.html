&gt; And for the last five years, I've been trying to develop a
&gt; dialogue with the SF communityNot just, "Here's what I'm doing,
&gt; here's the show, watch it, give us ratings, and be quiet," but
&gt; rather, "Here's what I'm doing...how close is this to what you've
&gt; been wishing someone would do? What are you tired of?
&gt; What do you think of this part over here?"
