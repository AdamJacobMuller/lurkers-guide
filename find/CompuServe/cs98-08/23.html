<pre>      Okay...I told you about Squirrel Nut Zippers, and Portishead
(those of you with good taste got that one, feh on the rest), and
Cherry Poppin' Daddies and Big Bad Voodoo Daddy before most anybody
else...and South Park just a bit before they broke out....

      Well, here's another recommendation, in the direction of the
surreal and the very funny and very weird.

      Sifl and Ollie.  MTV, weeknights at 12:30.  When you see what it
is, you'll think I've lost my mind to recommend it.  But just trust me
on this. Give it a chance.

                                                                  jms
