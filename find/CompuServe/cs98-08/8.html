<pre>{original post had no questions}

      Because we're shooting this week, the first few days on Crusade,
I'm still coming into the office, but taking it easy and not pushing
it.  The main problem was the trip and the stress of a full-blown
convention, the recirculated hotel air, shaking hands with a whole lot
of people who may have colds and the like...it was a disaster waiting
to happen under the current situation.

      At least filming is going well.

                                                                  jms
