<pre> T.P.Chai &lt;104674.3064@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; JMS, could you tell us how closely you are involved in the
&gt; Psi_Corps trilogy? the concept and name of the "kith", was that
&gt; from you or the author?

      The kith idea came from the author, and was a perfect way of
exploring the relationships there.

      Basically, I wrote detailed outlines for all three books, and
Gregory went away and wrote the books.  Frankly, I think this first Psi
Corps novel may be the best one to date, and that's saying a lot.

                                                                  jms
