<pre> Mike Lovitt &lt;75021.1731@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; How did he and Sinclair meet?
&gt; Why hasn,t he talked more with Dr. Franklin about Bester's
&gt; telepathic block?

      They met on Mars, as chronicled in one of the comics.

      Garibaldi has/will try a different approach to his problem.

                                                                  jms
