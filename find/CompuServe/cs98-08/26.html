<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Are you sleeping at least 8 hours /night?

      Had a bit of a rebound, for that reason, haven't been getting as
much sleep as I should've wit the first weeks of filming...not
monstrous, but vastly annoying.  It's exactly what I was told would
happen, but not as bad as it would've been if I'd've gone to WorldCon.

                                                                  jms
