<pre> SysOp Lee Whiteside &lt;76711.2660@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; What's the likelyhood you'll feel up to making it down to San
&gt; Diego this Saturday for your ComicCon presentation? Or should we
&gt; expect a telecommuting jms presentation?

      I should be able to make it down for ComicCon, though just for
the afternoon of the presentation.

                                                                  jms
