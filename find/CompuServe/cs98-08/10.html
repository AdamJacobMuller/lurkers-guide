<pre> Philip Hornsey &lt;74053.2101@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Did you get any more money per ep to make this series?
&gt; Also, is it going to be more expensive not to have the crutch of
&gt; the fixed B5 sets (I know your set designer was sorta a genius at
&gt; creating mix and match theater style sets)?

      We have a bit more money...though not a lot.  We'll do things as
we always do: smart.

                                                                  jms
