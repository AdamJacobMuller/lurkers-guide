<H2>B5 at ComicCon Canceled</H2>
<h3>Date: 14 Aug 1998 13:38:12 -0700</h3>
<pre>      I've left email for the folks at San Diego Comic Con, but
haven't yet heard back, and I want folks to have the most time to
adjust their schedules.

      As the doctor predicted, the pneumonia -- after a week of
feeling a little better -- has rebouned with a vengeance.  Going back
in today for a follow-up exam and more workups.  It's not as bad as it
would've been had I gone to WorldCon (that's what they keep telling me;
feeling as I do I have a hard time believing it because if it's true, I
can't even imagine what that would be like given what it's like *now*),
but it's laid me pretty low.

      Consequently, I won't be able to do the B5 presentation at San
Diego Comic Con on Saturday, or be there for the autographing session. 
There isn't any way to set up a replacement person and material, so
it's going to have to be canceled outright.

      SDCC is one of my two favorite conventions, that and LosCon; I
haven't missed either in something on the order of 12 years.  (If
nothing else I go to SDCC just to shop in the dealer's room for cool
Superman stuff.)  But this record has to be broken, much to my
considerable dismay.

                                                                  jms
