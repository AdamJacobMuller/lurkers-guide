<H2>Crusade Gone For Now</H2>
<h3>Date: 26 Feb 1999 13:12:04 -0700</h3>
<pre>      Well, we took our best shot.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it
don't.

      The SciFi Channel programming guys wanted the show; they wanted
it a lot.  They crunched numbers for almost two weeks trying to make it
work.  But at the end of the day, the problem was that they had already
allocated or spent their budget for the year, and couldn't come up with
the huge chunk of change necessary to get an entire season.  Had this
come up prior to January 1st, things would almost certainly have gone
differently.  But they have their budget, as we have ours, and it was
already allocated.

      So TNT will now air the full 13 produced, and that's the end of
it for now.  I say for now because WB has told us to fold and hold all
the sets, rather than scrap them, because they believe strongly in the
show, and feel that when the ratings come in we may well be able to
pick up a second season. We'll see.

      Meanwhile, I'm taking the day off, and deciding which of a
number of offers from networks and studios, sitting on my desk since B5
finished, to pick up.  I had declined to go that route so I could do
Crusade and keep playing in this universe, but absent that, there's no
reason not to go back to the networks and apply there some of what
we've been able to do in B5 and Crusade.

      My thanks to all those who wrote, and called, and emailed, and
lent their support to the process.  And I think that when you see the
show, you'll be quite pleased by what we did.  We're all very proud of
it.

                                                                  jms
