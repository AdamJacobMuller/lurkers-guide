"Now is the time to turn this to advantage.  The offers you have may

Please keep your little family here posted on what you decide to do."

      Will do.  One thing has already hit; as word got out Friday, one
of the networks called and asked me to write a non-SF TV movie for them
to shoot late summer/fall, with a name star.  I said sure, so that's
now in process. Can't talk much about it for now, though.

                                                                  jms
