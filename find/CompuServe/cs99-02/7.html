<pre> T.P.Chai &lt;104674.3064@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Since you mentioned you had consulted with NASA on various
&gt; scientific details, I wonder if authors of the novels have the
&gt; same benefit? or are they entirely on their own when it comes to
&gt; scientific research?

      No, often the authors send along questions, those get relayed to
us, and in some cases, as with Keyes first book, they get referred to
JPL which then answers 'em.

                                                                  jms
