<h3>Date: 26 Feb 1999 16:04:05 -0700</h3>
<pre> Janetch &lt;112013.1636@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; What happened?
&gt; Why the sudden change of heart?

      One element to the whole discussion is that B5 was already an
entity in its own right, and taking on the fifth year entailed
basically buying what was already there, as opposed to becoming
involved with the creative process of influencing a new series.

                                                                  jms
