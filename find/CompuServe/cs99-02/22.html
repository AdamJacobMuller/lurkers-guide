<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Do you have any idea what kind of promotion TNT will give the
&gt; show? Do you mean picked up by TNT or by SciFi?

"Joe, I am so amazed that you can still have any kind of faith in the
business of television the way you've been jerked around from the
beginning of Babylon 5 and now this. Every season you've had to
struggle to stay on the air, but you've kept at it and kept at it.
We're really looking forward to your work on the other projects you've
said you've been offered.  You must have the tenacity of a bulldog."

      You just accept certain things about the business going in.  You
can't look to anybody else with faith to give you want you want, you
have to be willing to work for it.  The faith has to be in the work,
and only in the work, because in the end, that's the only thing that
matters.

                                                                  jms
