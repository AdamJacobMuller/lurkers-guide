<pre> SysOp Dupa T. Parrot &lt;70040.104@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Well, next time you do better, eh?
&gt; So, has the success of B5 brought more offers than before?

"So, has the success of B5 brought more offers than before?"

      Definitely.  It showed that I could run a series and keep it on
budget and make it an international success.  Right now those elements
are in heavy demand at the networks.  Even though the pay is half in
cable what you get at the network level, I was content to stay with
Crusade if it meant keeping our team together, and playing in the B5
universe a bit longer.  Absent that, then there's every reason to take
up one or two of those offers.

                                                                  jms
