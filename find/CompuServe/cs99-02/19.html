&gt; One question: do you think that the success of such writers as
&gt; Carter, Kelley and Whedon on the regular networks will make it
&gt; easier for you to win battles of artistic control in future
&gt; projects? "Are you trying to Londo me?"

"One question:  do you think that the success of such writers as

      Probably not.  Those are always fought one at a time.
