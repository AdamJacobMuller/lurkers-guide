<pre> Jeff Peterman &lt;75361.430@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; So where does SF fit in?
&gt; Meanwhile, maybe there is enough demand for you to go directly to
&gt; video?

      No, you can't do a series to video, it has to be aired.  And DTV
is considered a poor man's venue, for stuff that couldn't make it
elsewhere.

                                                                  jms
