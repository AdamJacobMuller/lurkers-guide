<pre> Philip Hornsey &lt;74053.2101@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Do you ever get sick of this?
&gt; WHAT GOD@MN PART OF SUCCESS DON'T THESE IDIOTS WANT!?!??!

      The job of being a writer means constantly proving your talent
to those who have none.  I'm used to it.

"On top of that, did you notice in the last Voyager "movie" the Borg
planning to assimilate Earth by introducing a nano-based plague that
would take a few years to do the job...gaaaaagghh"

      Say what...?
