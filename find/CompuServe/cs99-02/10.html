"I just watched Deconstruction of Falling Stars for the 6th time and I
have to tell you a lot of people are predecting gloom and doom for
Crusade but I belive that it will be shown and I belive that It will be
as good as Babylon 5"

      Same crap happened when we did B5..."it's just a DS9
ripoff"..."it's going to be another stupid SF show with dopey people
and lousy writing and EFX..."

      Been there, done that, got the series....
