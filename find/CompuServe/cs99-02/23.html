<pre> Michael Beemer &lt;71551.1670@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; One *or two*?
&gt; How do you make the time?
&gt; Or are the duties "lighter" in the network jobs?

" &gt; Absent that, then there's every reason to take up one or two of
&gt; those offers.
One *or two*?  How do you make the time?  Or are the duties
"lighter" in the network jobs?"

      There's different kinds of deals, timings of deals, and
different kinds of positioning (first position, second position,
contractual stuff) that can give you the flexibility to have a couple
of different gigs going at somewhat the same time.  The TV movie I
mentioned uptopic for instance doesn't interfere with anything else.

                                                                  jms
