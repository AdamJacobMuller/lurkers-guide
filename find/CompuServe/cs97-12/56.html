<pre> Tom Knudsen &lt;72347.1626@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; However, if it was tampered with [ie, had it's mass or gravity
&gt; (and yes, I'm an engineer and I know these two things are usually
&gt; intimately related] increased) in an effort to increase it's
&gt; output, who know's WHAT is possible? If the human decendants a
&gt; million years from now are as advanced as they seem, who know's
&gt; what technology they could have mastered?

      And what if you, say, interfered substantially with the mass of
the sun by, say, causing a series of jump points to open up *inside*
the sun across several days?

                                                                  jms
