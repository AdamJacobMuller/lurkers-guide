<pre>      Just a note to remind folks that my email address is to be used
only for stuff that can't or shouldn't be discussed publicly, for
personal stuff. It's starting to fill up with general questions about
the themes of the show, plot stuff and the like, questions which would
serve better in the open forums where the answers would profit other
people, and save me from having to answer the same question X-times
privately.

                                                                  jms
