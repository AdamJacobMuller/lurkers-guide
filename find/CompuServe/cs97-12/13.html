<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;75063.3305@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; And wouldn't Sheridan qualify more as a legally detained prisoner
&gt; than a political prisoner?

      Yeah, he's legally detained, but he's being *illegally*
tortured. That's the distinction.  Nothing here is being done for the
prisoner's benefit, but for the interrogators.

                                                                  jms
