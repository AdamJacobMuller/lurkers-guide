<pre> Jonathan Kass &lt;74130.443@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Stephen Furst mentioned at Creation last weekend that he just
&gt; signed a 5 year extension - is that standard stuff?

"Just a curiousity side question... Stephen Furst mentioned at
Creation last weekend that he just signed a 5 year extension - is that
standard stuff?"

      No, that was a result of having amended Stephen's contract when
he did "Misery Loves Company" a while back.

                                                                  jms
