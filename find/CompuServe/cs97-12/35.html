<pre> Roseann &lt;103510.1542@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; He's a pretty smart kid, but a little emotionally immature (but
&gt; after all he is ten), would the B5 books be "over his head" or do
&gt; you think he would grasp it? Any suggestions on other titles I
&gt; could get for him?

      That's an okay one to start with...I'd also suggest the Hobbit,
and if you can find it the Mad Scientists Club and A Wrinkle in Time.

                                                                  jms
