<pre> Neville White &lt;100335.2721@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Would you care to share any pointers about what might have
&gt; happened to the character Ivanova in the future?

      Thanks...as for what Claudia would've been doing this season,
some bits of that have been sliced off and put into other characters,
so I can't comment until it hits the air.

      And thanks again...it's a good end for the season.

                                                                  jms
