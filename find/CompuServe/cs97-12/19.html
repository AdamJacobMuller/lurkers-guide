"But I'm not certain that in this case the people putting up the posts
are the jerks responsible for the rumors.  In at least one case I'm
pretty sure it was a somewhat panicky *fan* of the show who heard
something and didn't think it through to see how ludicrous it was."

      I've been on the nets for a long, long, very long time, and I've
yet to see a case of this where the person actually *heard* this, until
after it had long gotten into the fan community.  People *say* they
heard these things just to give it some credibility and someone to
blame so they don't have to take the rap for it themselves.  If they
*really* heard it from someone, then post that person's name.  They
were willing to post the rumor, which caused hurt and confusion and
distress, why not post the person's name who said it, so that this
person can be enlightened and corrected?  But they never do, because 
there never IS "the other person."

      They're sickos, liars, flakes, yoyos, yipyops, yahoos, bozos and
kadodies.
