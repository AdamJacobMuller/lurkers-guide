<pre> T.P.Chai &lt;104674.3064@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Since you are going to be in NY, it's such a short hop to T.O.,
&gt; would you consider coming up here to do promo if the offer is
&gt; reasonable??

      I'll generally go anywhere to help the show.

                                                                  jms
