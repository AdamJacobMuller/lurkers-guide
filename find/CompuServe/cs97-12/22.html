"...well half of this one was probably true from what i've heard
nobody liked the pilot as aired including JMS."

      Well, actually, if NObody liked the pilot we *wouldn't* have
become a series.  But the ratings were very good, and a lot of folks
*do* and did like the pilot.  It just could've been better, which is my
take on it, and now that we've gone in and adusted it it, is *is*
better.

                                                                  jms
