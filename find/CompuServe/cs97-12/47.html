"JMS indicated once the budget for these movies wasn't much greater
than the shows (basically that of two episodes if I remember right). I
don't believe it! It looks a lot better... do I have some wrong info or
something?"

      We did the movie for less than $3 million, which *technically*
is 3 episodes worth to pay for 2 episodes worth of running time,
*except* that rates tend to go up across the board for movies, so when
you adjust for that, yeah, it ain't much above episodic stuff.  What
you're seeing is the result of what we've been learning as we've gone
along over the 4 years of the show. Remember, our blood oath has been
the same from the start: each year we *have* to do better than the year
before, we don't have the luxury of any sort of established name,
quality is our only recourse.

      We implemented more of the lessons we've learned there, and in
the fifth season.  It's more a philosophical thing, in how we do what
we do, than a money thing.

                                                                  jms
