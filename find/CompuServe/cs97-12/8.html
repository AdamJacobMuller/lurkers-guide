<H2>JMS new Series?</H2>

<pre>{original post had no questions}

      A first season hasn't been committed to, at least in contractual
terms to me, and I can assure you that the series would be
season-by-season, like any other show.  It's never been broached to us
as a five-year deal.

                                                                  jms
