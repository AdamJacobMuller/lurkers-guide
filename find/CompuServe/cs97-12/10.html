<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Diamond's December catalog has a modified B5 logo (standard
&gt; Babylon 5 logo with the words "Earth Alliance Space Station") on
&gt; the page with the new 6 inch action figures (yay!) -- is this the
&gt; new logo you mentioned or is it one I've just never seen? Jeff
&gt; Sigh Corps - Pat Tallman Division Great Maker huh?

      No, that ain't it.

                                                                  jms
