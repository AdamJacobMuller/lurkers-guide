<pre> Elyse M. Grasso &lt;70302.3304@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; What are the good brands of S-VHS tapes, and what are good places
&gt; to find them at reasonable prices? What are people's favorite
&gt; surround-effect scenes in seasons 2 through 4 (which are the ones
&gt; I have on tape)?

      Don't forget the subwoofer....

      I generally go for the TDK SVHS tapes, in general I've had fewer
problems with those than any other brand.

      We had good surround when Sinclair is getting "What do you
want?" bounced back and forth at him, also when Talia is listening to
the many voices in "A Race Through Dark Places."  Overall, you'll get
most or all of the ship-bys we do, and you'll get the nice separation
of voices in the S5 title sequence.  We use the surrounds to give a
sense of place, and ambiance, more than anything else.  Pop in any
really busy action sequence and you'll get a good sense of movement.

      In general, the basic pro-logic setting is usually fine for B5.

                                                                  jms
