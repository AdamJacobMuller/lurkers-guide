      Short answer before the long one...obviously I cannot go into
any establishment, or have TNT do so, and have them contravene their
usual policies on smoking or drinking on our behalf...that's not
something that's in my purview.

      I got the list of places last week that will be part of the
series of open parties, and I'm pretty sure they're all bars of one
sort or another, for the primary reason that they all have
satellite/TNT feeds, and have the resources for a party other than one
that is catered.  Most average restaurants don't have those kind of
facilities.  Jeffrey Willerth advised me about this in a memo, because
he knows my feelings about alcohol.  So I asked hilm (he's the one in
touch with the folks at TNT) to try and find some additional, non-bar
venues.  Whether or not this is possible, especially at this late date,
remains to be seen, but TNT was nice enough to say they'd try and find
something.  The problem, as noted above, is finding places that have 
the necessary facilities.

                                                                  jms
