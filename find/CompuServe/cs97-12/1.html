<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;75063.3305@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Why were there no cameras monitoring Sheridan?

"Why were there no cameras monitoring Sheridan?"

      Torturers rarely videotape their work, thus assuring that it can
never be used against them should things not go their way all the time.
This is kinda pro forma in South America, for instance.

                                                                  jms
