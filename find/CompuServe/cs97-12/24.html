<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; How is filming coming?
&gt; What episodes are done?
&gt; etc.?
&gt; How is the special effects work going?
&gt; Is anything new or interesting happening there?

"How is filming coming?  What episodes are done?"

      Filming is going great; we're shooting 513 as I speak, with John
Copeland directing (John did "Endgame").  We shoot through 514 then we
break for Christmas, coming back on the 4th.  The first 6 episodes have
been completely finished (technically mixing the sixth one tomorrow,
but it's a fine distinction), and delivered to TNT, which has had
nothing but praise for the stuff this season.

"How is the special effects work going?  Is anything new or
interesting happening there?"

      Fine there; the most interesting stuff has been in the prequel,
and now in Thirdspace as we start producing stuff for that, since both
movies are very ambitious.  We're doing more compositing stuff for the
series, trying some new things, getting progressively closer to the
objects in the show to give a dynamic realism to them.  But most of the
interesting stuff this time around tends to be in the story and the
personal relationships, and changes everyone's going through.

                                                                  jms
