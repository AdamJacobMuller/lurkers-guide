<pre> Neil S. Turkenkopf &lt;102664.3532@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I could be wrong,but I'm pretty sure jms himself even said
&gt; so,since he still uses 3.1? To any of you who already have it,does
&gt; it run *at all* on Windows 3.1? Am I just being silly to think
&gt; that there's even a small chance that it'll work?

      No, it's specifically for Win 95.  A version I got for proofing
stuff was for 3.1 but for release purposes, it has to be one or the
other to have all the bells and whistles.  Virtually *everything* out
now is for nothing less than Win95.  (Just bought Riven, the Myst
sequel, and can't play that either until I upgrade, which I'll do when
I have time.)

                                                                  jms
