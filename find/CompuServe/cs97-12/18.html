      It's utter crap, like all such rumors.  These people put them up
and come up with ways to make it sound real, but it's crap.  TNT is in
love with what they're seeing, we've had no problems with them, they've
given us the biggest PR campaign in their *history* to launch the new
show and reruns... these rumors are put there by people who enjoy
making others jump around and respond to them, and put out fires. 
They're no different than the kinds of folks who light grass fires near
homes and watch from cover giggling as the firefighters come out to
deal with it all...makes them feel important, because their lives are
sad and pathetic and basically irrelevant.

      Like the rumor that I had a heart attack on the way to the
stage; the phone calls that came into the stage tied up phone lines and
ended up as a huge hassle for everyone.

      Look, it's really this simple...and I'm not mad at you, I'm mad
at them...if there's a problem, I WILL TELL YOU.  I've been doing that
for five years now.  Every time one of these rumors comes up, everybody
goes running around like chickens with their heads cut off until I can
calm everyone down, and then two weeks later it's the same thing over
and over, one manufactured crisis after another that takes up your time
and my time in responding.

      So this is just one more BS stupid rumor by an online jerk, of
which there are many.  Just take that line and cut and paste it on the
next stupid BS rumor.

                                                                  jms
