<pre> SysOp_Dupa_T_Parrot &lt;70040.104@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; is that from ITB?
&gt; (if so, he sure lost a LOT of hair between ITB and The Gathering
&gt; &lt;g&gt;) Or did Londo do Rogane? is that from a season 5 episode?
&gt; Or is B5 hosting the World Cup?

"Regarding the one shot of Londo with hair down to his forehead... is
that from ITB? (if so, he sure lost a LOT of hair between ITB and The
Gathering."

      Yeah, well, so did I....

"Also, the scenes of what looks likes a riot on the station... is that
from a season 5 episode? I don't recall those scenes in season 4."

      They're from Thirdspace.

                                                                  jms
