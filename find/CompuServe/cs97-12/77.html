      Oddly, the newspapers had it right, TV Guide didn't.

      But they're going to be airing the Guide sandwiched in between
the two TV movies airing next Sunday, so we're golden.

      (ItB got a great review in TV Guide...called it "stunning" and
"riveting.")

                                                                  jms
