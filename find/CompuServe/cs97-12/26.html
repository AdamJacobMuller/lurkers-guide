<pre> Schmulenson &lt;72447.224@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I may be missing something but I haven't seen any adds for the
&gt; show in the paper or promo's(but I don't watch tv often)-where
&gt; are they?

      There are ads all over the place...especially on TNT.  You'll
see more as we get closer to air.

                                                                  jms
