"It does, however, make it interesting in that I think this is the
first incidence of an AMERICAN made show surviving the loss of it's
lead actor."

      Actually, not correct...there have been many cases of this, from
MASH to Bewitched to other shows.  It's not common, certainly, but not
unheard-of.
