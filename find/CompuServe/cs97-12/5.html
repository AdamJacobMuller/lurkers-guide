<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;75063.3305@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Understood, but why were there no surveillance cameras watching
&gt; (not taping) such an important prisoner, especially when he
&gt; wasn't being "interrogated"? Did they just not think of it?

      Mainly because, in the research I'd done, it's just rarely if
ever done in real life, and real life was my template here.  There's TV
logic, and there's what tends to happen in the real world, and I tend
to err in the direction of the latter.

                                                                  jms
