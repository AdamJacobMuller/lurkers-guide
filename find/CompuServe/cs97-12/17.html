<H2>B5ers do it very late.</H2>

<pre> Peter Deeks &lt;113213.3222@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Do I get the impression you get the same problem in the States?
&gt; It's crazy, isn't it?

      Thanks....

      Bear in mind that the C4 programmers put it late because they
received many calls from B5 viewers asking for a later slot, since they
said C4 was treating the show as a kid's show...so this is a situation
where C4 gets yelled at whichever way it goes.

                                                                  jms
