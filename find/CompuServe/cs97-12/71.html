<pre> Neil S. Turkenkopf &lt;102664.3532@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Doesn't the sound of all those jaws dropping give you a headache?

      I think the only reason we're still amazing them is that they're
only now finding *out* about us.  We're doing what we've been doing for
5 years now, it's just taken folks this long to notice us (which is
about what I figured would be the case going in).

                                                                  jms
