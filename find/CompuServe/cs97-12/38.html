<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Does Andrew Porter have a time machine?
&gt; Have you seen the photo of yourself on page 15 of the November
&gt; Science Fiction Chronicle? What's that about?

      No, I haven't seen it yet.  Will look it up.  On the other
project, not much to say until paperwork comes.

                                                                  jms
