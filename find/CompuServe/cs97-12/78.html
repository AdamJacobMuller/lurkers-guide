      The scary thing is to look at the promos John and I did for WB
for the pilot and first season.  I didn't have a grey hair on my head,
and there was more of it; John had a few, but has since gone totally
grey-white from the rigors of this show, all in five years.

      Thing is, though, I look at the promises we made in those early
interviews, and by golly, we kept every one of them.

                                                                  jms
