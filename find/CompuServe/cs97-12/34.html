<pre> Tom Knudsen &lt;72347.1626@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; You don't happen to know if they still sell them, do you?

      Yeah, they still sell 'em.  Interesting history...the Hamilton
Ventura was the first electric watch produced.  When the art deco case
went out of fashion (as if art deco *ever* goes out of fashion), they
discontinued it. As I understand it, and this is only based on what
I've been told, I have no first-hand knowledge here, back a few years
ago, when I bought mine, they had found some of the original parts and
pieces and casings and released a small number of them.  They were all
snapped up, and Hamilton decided it might be a good idea to release
them for real in a newly manufactured line.

                                                                  jms
