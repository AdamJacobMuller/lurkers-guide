<pre> Roseann &lt;103510.1542@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Did you know that the executives at Paramount didn't want to do
&gt; that? How do you not take them in a head lock down the hall and
&gt; hold their heads in the toliet and flush it a few times? Do they
&gt; not *know* how to market the shows or what?

      Here's the stupid thing about the syndication worry: it's
nonexistent. The stations invariably grab shows in production order
unless something is specifified to the contrary on the inventory
sheets.  Every so often, some of the animated shows I worked on years
ago will show up...and they're *still* being played in correct order,
and I doubt very much the station is trying to do so, it's just a
matter of going in numerical order off the charts.  This is a concern
that goes back to very early syndication that doesn't hold anymore.

                                                                  jms
