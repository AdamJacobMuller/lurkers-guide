"It looks as if TNT will not give B5 anymore respect than the
independent TV stations did as to when they will air it.  They have to
be bettter than WSKB though.  This torked me off too."

      This only happened due to the game.  There won't be games coming
on before the episodes themselves, so we'll be on time.

      And believe me, they've *already* given this show more respect
than the syndicated stations did.

                                                                  jms
