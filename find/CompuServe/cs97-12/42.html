<pre> Craig M. Bobchin &lt;102354.3246@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Who chose the characters for the directory?
&gt; Could you give a bit of a hint where I should start looking?

"Who chose the characters for the directory? There are a few noteable
exceptions that probably should have been included. I'm talking about
Bester, Talia, Morden and both Koshs."

      The conceit of the disk is that it's a guide to the station as
of the end of the 4th season.  That's why neither Vorlon is listed,
since they're gone by that time, ditto for Morden who was never
actually a resident or officially a part of B5 and wouldn't be listed
in any event, and of course Talia was gone a while back.

"You mentioned that there is kind of an easter egg hidden on the disk
somewhere. Could you give a bit of a hint where I should start
looking?"

      Just keep poking around until you find something that sounds
right.

                                                                  jms
