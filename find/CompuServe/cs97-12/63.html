<pre> Philip Hornsey &lt;74053.2101@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Do you see Star Trek listed...do you see a seperate section for
&gt; B5? to all of this, did you find it interesting that the biggest
&gt; objection that the Trekkies had to First Contact was that Picard
&gt; actually *showed anger* about having been kidnapped, mutilated,
&gt; and forced to assist in the destruction of his own race?

"You may soon wish to reconsider this POV. IMHO you will soon be
bigger than Star Trek (why am I suddenly reminded of the Beatles?)."

      It's certainly a wonderful thought, but here's why I think it
won't happen.

      At its core, B5 is a thinking man's (and woman's) show.  A
viewer has to bring a lot to the table, pay attention, and be willing
to be reflective to get out of it all that the show has to offer.  That
pretty much precludes it from being a big pop-culture phenomenon.  I
think we'll always do well, and we'll be around for a long, long
time...but as a cult show, as the Prisoner is a cult show.

      Which is absolutely aces by me.  I got to tell my story, and
make something that'll endure, and that's why I entered the race in the
first place.

                                                                  jms
