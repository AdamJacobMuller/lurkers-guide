      The ones under discussion, the 6" figures, are killer...they're
even closer in appearance, sleeker, their faces are great...and
apparently they'll be available from both Toys R Us *and* Diamond (via
comics stores).  These are definitely the ones that'll go on my desk.

                                                                  jms
