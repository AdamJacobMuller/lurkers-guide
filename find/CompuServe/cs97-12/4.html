<pre> John Creigh &lt;75270.423@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is that something you put together for TNT as a teaser?
&gt; Do you have her interacting with G'Kar much in season 5?

      The third one I showed was a music video I commissioned a while
back to pull together the show overall for TNT and conventions.

      We haven't had many scenes between Lochley and G'Kar yet, but
that will likely change.  And yeah, Tracy's doing a great job.

                                                                  jms
