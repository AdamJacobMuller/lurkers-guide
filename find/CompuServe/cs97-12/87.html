      I have a directTV satellite dish, and I have to tell you I would
*never* go back to cable.  The quality is substantially better, you
have far more options, it never goes out, the per-month charges are
about the same, for more services, and the initial cost of the setup
has dropped dramatically in the last few months to just a couple
hundred bucks for a basic system.

                                                                  jms
