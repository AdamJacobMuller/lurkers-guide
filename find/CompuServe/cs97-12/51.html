<pre> Stephen Edwards &lt;101741.771@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I know you do not want to do a sixth season of B5 but are you
&gt; planning to do any spin off's set in the B5 universe, Like Star
&gt; Trek did with Voyager ??

      Yes, there are plans for a follow-up series.  A back issue of
Dreamwatch has a lot of info about it.

                                                                  jms
