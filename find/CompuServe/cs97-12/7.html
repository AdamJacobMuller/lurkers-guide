<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; What would the best way be to do that?
&gt; Dont know if its propoer etiquette to ask you to pass them Bruce?

      You can send them on to me via the B5 mail drop, 14431 Ventura
Boulevard, Suite 260, Sherman Oaks, CA 91423.  I'll see they get to
Bruce and John.  (Or you can send them directly to John and Bruce via
that address.)

                                                                  jms
