<pre> Colin Heaps &lt;100622.3610@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; As for Ivanova's departure, isn't it amazing what a 10-second
&gt; voice-over can achieve? One complaint though, what am I going to
&gt; do with my time until season 5 comes around?

      Thanks, and after we're gone...well, yer on yer own.

                                                                  jms
