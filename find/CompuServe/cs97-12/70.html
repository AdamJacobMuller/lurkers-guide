      Yeah, it's a struggle, and hard work, no mistake, but we also
have our fair share of fun as well.  What makes it more bearable is
that we've instituted a humane system of film-making.  Most shows shoot
16 hour days and then some.  We shoot 12 and that's it.  If you plan
out what you're doing properly, and don't get reckless, you can do
that.  The Directors' Guild has been fighting for 12 hour days for
years, and been told that it couldn't be done.  Then recently they
heard about us, and their jaws dropped, and they're coming out to do an
article that says, in essence, see, it CAN be done.  And has been done
successfully for 5 years.

                                                                  jms
