<pre> Bruno Melancon &lt;102647.3222@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; 2 questions: 1) What does "3 first acts" mean?
&gt; 2) When does your script begins?
&gt; It seemed six years after the War, but since the last TV show
&gt; doesn't end with an armistice, how did you approach the beginning
&gt; of your show?

       The last V movie ended with the armistice, as I recall; and 3
acts means the 3 dramatic sections between commercials.

                                                                  jms
