<pre> Bill Dugan &lt;71016.576@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Do you mean that relations wouldn't be fertile, or that it would
&gt; be physically impossible to do it at all?

       They wouldn't be fertile, no...as for impossible, the long
history of odd human sexual behavior seems to indicate that for some
folks, there ain't much that's impossible to mess about with.

                                                                  jms
