<pre>       Okay, so you've got some friends who've maybe checked out B5,
and they've kinda gone back and forth...maybe the week you asked them
to watch was a slower episode, and they wanted something other...or it
was a bit too much on the arc-ish side

       Give 'em a call and have them watch "Severed Dreams" this
coming week. Don't say anything more than that, just make get 'em to do
it.

       We'll take it from there.

       Trust me on this one.

                                                                  jms
