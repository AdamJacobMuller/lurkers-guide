<pre> Philip Hornsey &lt;74053.2101@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Incidently, was it in response to this submission that the
&gt; infamous "If we give the SF fans rayguns and spaceships the'll
&gt; show up" comment was made?

       No, that comment came when I was still a reporter with the
late, lamented LA Herald Examiner, when the V series was still in
production, by one of the producers of the series.

                                                                  jms
