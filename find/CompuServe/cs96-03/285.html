       Exactly.  B5 has to be an organic process; it's a history of
the Babylon station and the people who lived there once upon a time. 
It should have the feeling of a real place, and real people.  Stuff
happens to real people.  The key is to turn it to your advantage, and
use it to make the story stronger.

       It's like trying to tapdance while people are rolling bowling
balls at you and firing burning arrows...if you can keep to the rhythm,
and even add some interesting new steps because of all the commotion,
while making it all feel perfectly natural...then you've got something.

                                                                  jms
