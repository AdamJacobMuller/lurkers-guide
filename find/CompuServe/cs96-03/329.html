<pre> James R. Kapesis &lt;104154.27@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; How do you decide whether a episode will be a two parter or as a
&gt; series of connected stand alones like "Severed Dreams" is a part
&gt; of? Do you have any two part episodes planned for season 4 yet?

       For the most part, it's a matter of how the episodes feel to
me, what length they feel as if they require.  When I did the big three
this year -- Messages, Point and Dreams -- I hadn't really figured
they'd be as tightly connected as they ended up being.  I knew they'd
relate strongly to one another, but in a sense, they're reallly a three
parter.  The War Without End story I knew was WAY too big for one
episode, but due to the structure of the story wouldn't take being
extended for one more episode; at that point you'd just be dragging it
out.

       It's all instinct, I wish I had a more concrete answer.

                                                                  jms
