<pre> Philip Hornsey &lt;74053.2101@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is it safe to say that one day we *will* see a resoution of the
&gt; Londo-G'Kar thread that will dispose of the dream in *some
&gt; manner*, even if that is Londo doing something that makes that
&gt; unlikely to happen?

       But of course....

                                                                  jms
