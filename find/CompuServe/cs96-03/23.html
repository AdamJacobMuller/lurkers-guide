<H2>San Diego ComiCon?</H2>
<h3>Date: 02-Mar-96 18:56:33</h3>
<pre> Richard Cunningham &lt;71213.3504@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Okay..since I got my little sign-up guide for SDCC the other day,
&gt; do you know if you'll be doing a presentation, and if so, which
&gt; day?

       Nothing's been firmed up, they haven't spoken to me directly
yet, but invariably I do a presentation (usually they're one of the
biggest events of the con), so I'd *imagine* nothing's changed this
year, but at this point I don't have any real info.

                                                                  jms
