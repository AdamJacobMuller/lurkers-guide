       No, I'm not in any way a "proud papa" or *any* kind of papa
when it comes to Hypernauts.  I had nothing more to do with it than
recommending Christy Marx as story editor and to write the pilot, and
offering a few suggestions when asked, which was rarely.  The H-team
did this entirely on their own, though certainly some of the B5
production models (meaning *how* we do things) were used to make the
show containable for television.

       A number of shows have scoped out how we've done things, and
are learning from our experience.  This can only lead to more SF TV,
which is in general a Good Thing.

                                                                  jms
