       Better for B5, though, in that TNT has a lot more coverage,
more cable stations, and more PR than the SciFi channel.  More folks
will be able to hear about it and see it on TNT.  (I should mention
that TNT is *very* excited about the show, as much as we're exited to
be going there after the first run is over, and they're planning to
give it a regular time slot and a lot of publicity.)

                                                                  jms
