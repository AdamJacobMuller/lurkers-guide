<H2>NEW B5 EPS!</H2>
<h3>Date: 10-Mar-96 22:44:30</h3>
<pre>       Good news.  We've finally convinced Warner Bros./PTEN to go
with eight new episodes in a row, starting the first week of April. 
The new schedule, which just went out via fax to the stations today, is
as follows:

       So here now is the revised schedule:

       NEW EPISODES:
       2/12    EXOGENESIS
       2/19    MESSAGES FROM EARTH
       2/26    POINT OF NO RETURN              (w/Majel Barrett)

       RERUNS:
       3/4     FALL OF NIGHT
       3/11    THERE ALL THE HONOR LIES
       3/18    AND NOW FOR A WORD
       3/25    IN THE SHADOW OF Z'HA'DUM

       NEW EPISODES:
       4/1     SEVERED DREAMS
       4/8     CEREMONIES OF LIGHT AND DARK
       4/15    SIC TRANSIT VIR
       4/22    A LATE DELIVERY FROM AVALON     (w/Michael York)
       4/29    SHIP OF TEARS                   (w/Walter Koenig)
       5/6     INTERLUDES AND EXAMINATIONS
       5/13    WAR WITHOUT END: PART ONE       (w/Michael O'Hare)
       5/20    WAR WITHOUT END: PART TWO

       We're now in the process of working to get 2 new episodes in
July, so there are only 3 left for October.  Even so, we're very
excited to get a chance to show eight episodes in a row, building up to
the end of the May sweeps with our big two-parter.

                                                                  jms
