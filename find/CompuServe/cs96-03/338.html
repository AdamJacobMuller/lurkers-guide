<pre> John M. Graham &lt;74166.3727@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Joe, I just finished watching my tape of "All Alone In The Night"
&gt; If it isn't giving anything away, could you clear up somthing for
&gt; me? Can you clarify this?

       Ivanova is the woman in each case; and that's Garibaldi, yes.

                                                                  jms
