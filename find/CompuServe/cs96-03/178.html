<pre> Philip Hornsey &lt;74053.2101@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I mean, everyone knows how to build 'em, and pretty well how they
&gt; work, but *everybody* bough plans for the things and they haven't
&gt; changed in the whole history of the galaxy?

       Yeah, generally, the tech is pretty standard, and universal, so
you don't get a lot of variation with jump gates.

                                                                  jms
