<H2>JMS:B5 on WB Network?</H2>
<h3>Date: 20-Mar-96 22:26:51</h3>
<pre> Tom Knudsen &lt;72347.1626@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; With PTEN going away, doesn't that mean that B5 is no longer a
&gt; PTEN show? Or is it just that WB won't take a show that didn't
&gt; originate on the WB?

       We're now pretty much the province of WB syndication, a very
different arm than WBN, so the dichotomy persists.

                                                                  jms
