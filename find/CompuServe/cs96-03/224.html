<pre> Laurence Moroney &lt;100546.50@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Near the mark?
&gt; love the 'V' script in the library, will we be seeing any more?

       Close, but there's a lot more involved in the third age than B5
or the shadows per se.

       Yes, there's a full V script -- 4 hours worth -- that I wrote
for WB, but it'll never get made; too expensive for syndication. 
(Heck, it was also too expensive for *network*...which is one reason
why we had to fight so hard to get B5 on the air.  V the series nearly
torpedoed WB television all by itself due to bugetary over-runs.)

                                                                  jms
