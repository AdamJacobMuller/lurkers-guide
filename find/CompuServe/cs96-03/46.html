<pre> Mike Hoffmann &lt;100321.2604@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is this sudden request related to the events of message abuse?

       If Brent Barrett -- not one of the Demento Half-Dozen -- is
asking permission to repost your messages, then he's doing this
properly.  So if you don't mind your posts being reposted, by all
means, give permission.

                                                                  jms
