<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Are you going to have some sort of "Charter Membership" for those
&gt; of us who are standing in line on day one?

       One of the things we'll be offering for the first 100 signups,
when the details are announced, are full-color decals/stickers of the
*alternate* B5 logo designed by Peter Ledger, never actually used in
the show.  These are from my own personal collection of stuff we did
during the development period. We're still looking into what else can
be included for those first in line.

       What we're also going to do is to offer the first two issues of
the B5 newsletter free to those who signed onto the original
newsletter, which was going to run for only 5 issues, and stopped at
#3.  This way everyone gets their full money's worth.

       (The other day I suggested that we start the newsletter with
volume 5, on the theory that volumes 1-3 were destroyed or sabotaged at
the printer's, and volume 4 vanished mysteriously....)

                                                                  jms
