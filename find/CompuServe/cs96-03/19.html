<pre> Joe Salemi [ZD Net] &lt;72631.23@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I was wondering about that; so, unlike the usual pattern where
&gt; each show is a few weeks after the last, these three are
&gt; continuous over a span of a couple of days?

       Not per se, no; you can have one picking up a frame later, but
there are still time gaps in *story*.  Between 1 and 2 there's only a
few hours; but between 2 and 3 there's several days or so.

                                                                  jms
