<pre> Laurence Moroney &lt;100546.50@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Does that mean it ends this season?
&gt; What happens then to years 4 and 5?

       I think it's fair to say that the shadow war will drag on into
at least a portion of the fourth season.

       Bear in mind that in the first season, we didn't even know the
shadows *existed* until it was almost over.  This is more than just the
story of this particular war.

                                                                  jms
