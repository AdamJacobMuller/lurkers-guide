<pre> James R. Kapesis &lt;104154.27@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Does the fact that WB is giving away a chance to be an extra on
&gt; B5 which would presumable have to happen in season 4, bode well
&gt; for renewal?

       One would think the contest would bode well...but there are
always ways out and consolation prizes.  It guarantees nothing but we
take some small reassurance in it.

                                                                  jms
