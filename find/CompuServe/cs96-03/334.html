<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Do you have anyone to research before the final script?
&gt; Have there been any major errors in continuity?
&gt; Or will you not tell if there were?

       No, I kinda have to keep it all in my head.  Nobody knows the
show more than I do, so a researcher wouldn't work.  So far, in 3
years, I don't think there have been any real continuity goofs.

                                                                  jms
