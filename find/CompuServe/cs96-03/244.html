<pre> Matt Allen &lt;100530.232@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Are the computer Fx also in widescreen?
&gt; But as far as I know the PAR can't put down widescreen stuff
&gt; unless you screw around with the output resolution?

       We'd pretty much have to re-render the CGI for important shots,
while more mundane stuff where there's nothing in the upper and lower
parts of the frame could be safely cropped and lose nothing.

                                                                  jms
