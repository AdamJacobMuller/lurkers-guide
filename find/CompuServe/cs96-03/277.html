<pre> James R. Kapesis &lt;104154.27@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; When Andrea Thompson told you she was leaving the show, did you
&gt; consider replacing her with another actress?

       Fundamentally, for reasons that become clearer later this
season, I needed *a* telepath on the station, in one of several
possible positions; it's what we call in TV writing "a moveable piece."
Didn't affect things in any significant way, except to allow the return
of Lyta, which opens up a LOT of great story areas.

                                                                  jms
