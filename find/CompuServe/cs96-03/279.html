       It's two separate mechanisms; no one has been able to open a
jump point in a jump point because of the hideous amount of energy
needed by the ship in question.  They used the White Star to open a
jump point within a standing *jump gate* that was already there, and
had a secondary source of power.  The competing energies were
impossible to control, and blew the whole thing.

       And yes, I'm *that* jms.

                                                                  jms
