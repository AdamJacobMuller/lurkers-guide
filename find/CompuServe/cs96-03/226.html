<H2>Thought from jms</H2>
<h3>Date: 18-Mar-96 14:02:22</h3>
<pre> Philip Hornsey &lt;74053.2101@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Gee, there was stuff omitted?
&gt; Have you ever considered asking Warner to let you do a 2 hour
&gt; syndicated series?

       We end up cutting stuff out of every episode to some extent.  I
believe in writing long so you can take out any bits that don't work as
well, so only the strong stuff remains, and keep the pacing fast. 
Usually it's just line cutting within a scene, but on a few occasions
we've snipped out an entire short scene when necessary.

                                                                  jms
