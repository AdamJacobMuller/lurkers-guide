<pre> Philip Hornsey &lt;74053.2101@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; More seriously, if you were to suddenly discover that Warner
&gt; would only pony up for 88 eps (like they did for Kung Fu), but
&gt; *would* do that to get a good syndication position, could you
&gt; finish out the story with 21 more and a movie?

       Yes, if WB said there's no 5th season, period, end of
discussion, the market has gotten too glutted, it won't sustain
it...yes, the story could be collapsed into year four.  It would just
mean omitting some of the personal non-arc episodes, and some segues. 
There are basically three major movements or themes that occupy the
last two years; best is to let them play out at a reasonable pace over
two years, but it could be collapsed into one, if that were to ever
become necessary.

       But obviously that would not be my first choice.

                                                               jms
