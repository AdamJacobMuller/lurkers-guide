       Thanks.

       There's not a lower house in the EA, in the sense that each
nation/state has its own various houses, and its own leader, but that
leader is also part of the EA senate.  One per nation/state.  Each
nation/state has its own constitution, but must not contravene the
larger principles of the EA constitution.

                                                                  jms
