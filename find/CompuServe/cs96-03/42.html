<pre> Joe Salemi [ZD Net] &lt;72631.23@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Am I correct in guessing that some of what would have been
&gt; Na'Toth's story moved over to Ta'Lon? Or did you plan on bringing
&gt; him back all along?

       I liked Ta'Lon, and definitely wanted to bring him back.

                                                                  jms
