<H2>Death of Turhan Again</H2>
<h3>Date: 20-Mar-96 22:26:52</h3>
<pre> Kevin P. Kenney &lt;104102.352@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; When can we expect to know about, or be able to ask about,
&gt; whether the death of Turhan was an assassination, and if so by
&gt; whom? Might a different (non-Talia) character that we have seen,
&gt; also been under the influence of an implanted personality,
&gt; partially controlling their actions in a certain episode? If I
&gt; specified who I was talking about and why (in-episode pointers)
&gt; in the last question, would I have crossed into the verboten
&gt; realms of plot ideas?

       No, Turhan's death was exactly as stated, natural causes.  If
it were anything else, we'd have at least nodded in that direction at
some point. It's not fair to do so otherwise.  Ditto re: any other
implanted person; there isn't one.  At least not that *I* know of.

                                                                  jms
