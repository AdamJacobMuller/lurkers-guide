<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; I don't want to criticize the Great Maker but, let's see now
&gt; where's that calculator? Almost $200, huh Joe?
&gt; Can you tell which episode this is from?

       The scene was from "Ceremonies of Light and Dark."

                                                                  jms
