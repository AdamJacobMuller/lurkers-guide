<pre>       Not bad.  Y'know, if I wuz you, I'd send this along to the
rastb5-info group for archiving.  Helps to answer the yahoos saying
I've left the arc behind and gone off to Latveria to work for Dr. Doom
or whatever nonsense is being proffered this week....

       It still tracks.

       Individual threads come and go, but the story still tracks.

                                                                  jms
