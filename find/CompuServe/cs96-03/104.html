       "Basically, it was a decision by the WB suits that was mutually
agreed to by all."

       Not correct.  It was first broached by me, to Michael, for
story reasons; we discussed it, mutually and amicably agreed that this
would work out for both of us, and then confirmed this with WB, to whom
we had indicated we might do this, pending the conversation with
Michael.

       There's a long post here that was written by me and archived at
the time; it's in one of the two B5 libraries.  It goes into great
detail on the whole thing.

                                                                  jms
