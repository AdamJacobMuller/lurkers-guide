<pre> Laurence Moroney &lt;100546.50@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Does that mean we will lose the Vorlons when the war is over?
&gt; Or, as a previous hypothesis of mine went, does that mean we will
&gt; _become_ the Vorlons when the war is over? By the way, Kosh is
&gt; Clarence isn't he?

       You make those assumptions about the war dominating the show
because that's the obvious way to go, and the way most shows *would*
go.  We're many things, but obvious ain't one of them.  There's more to
it.

       But no, we don't become Vorlons at the end of the war.  They're
who and what they are because they're millions of years older than we
are; you don't just get that status in a box of Crackerjacks.

                                                                  jms
