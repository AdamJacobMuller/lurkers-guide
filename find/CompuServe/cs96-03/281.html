       What those who use ratings to bash B5 tend to forget is the
history of ST...that the original ST limped along in the ratings
basement for its three seasons, that fans of Lost in Space were
constantly bashing it as an attempt to cash in on that show (some
reviewers even noted this, in TV Guide and elsewhere), and that finally
it got dropped as a ratings failure.

       One would think that knowledge might encourage tolerance....
