<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Have you received the Gary Numan tapes I sent?

       Yes, sorry, it's been busy, so I've only gotten a chance to
listen to one tape so far.  I'll be honest and say that while I think
it's good, it's not generally the kind of thing I tend to listen to for
very long, in that what I've heard so far doesn't seem to have a lot of
variation to it, it's very electronic, and after a while, for me, that
becomes white noise.  It's the kind of music you tend not to notice
after a while, and I like to notice my music.

       Nonetheless, you went through a great deal of effort to send it
along, and that is most definitely appreciated.  Musical tastes, like
anything else, vary widely.  I can see why many folks would like Mr.
Numan's work, and his background (in the clippings, for which I thank
you again) is most interesting.  It's just not the kind of thing that
winds my watch.

                                                                  jms
