<pre> Mike Hoffmann &lt;100321.2604@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; - Haven't rewatched the tape, but was there a mention of a ship
&gt; called Schwartzkopf, letting Hague escape from Io? - Who blasted
&gt; the escorts of the Alexander, if we saw and were told they
&gt; escaped?

       When we come back, the very next episode has a very funny scene
re: Londo and Narn security.  And yes, that was the Schwartzkopf.

       Thanks....
