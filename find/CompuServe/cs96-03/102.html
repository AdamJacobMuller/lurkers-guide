<pre> Brian A. Thomas &lt;75231.1122@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; You were not kidding when you said you were pulling the triggers
&gt; on the guns you set up were you? [Another moment of stunned
&gt; silance] What?! A repeat next?!
&gt; When in May do we get new episodes?

       You get new eps in April, the first week, rather than May.

                                                                  jms
