<H2>Lost Threads?</H2>
<h3>Date: 25-Mar-96 20:19:46</h3>
<pre> Kevin P. Kenney &lt;104102.352@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is this a fair assessment?
&gt; Have we lost a few percent of what you originally wanted the
&gt; story to be because of this? On a larger scale, how many threads
&gt; are there that you don't know the resolution to yet? (Hey, nothing
&gt; is set in TV till it is aired.) How many mysteries have you not
&gt; decided the answer to yet, since you're still willing to use
&gt; something cooler that you think up later? How much may we lose
&gt; because you can't fit it into episodes?

       Nothing dropped behind is ever essential; if it's essential, it
stays in, and gets paid off.  A story thread that hits a
reality-speedbump just gets modified, flows into another thread, just
like life.  You just keep on the road until you get to the end.  It's
just what the characters do.

                                                                  jms
