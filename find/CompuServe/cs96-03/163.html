<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; (Guess I'm dating mysel!) &lt;BG&gt; On another note, have you ever
&gt; kill off a main character in B5? If not, is that ever a
&gt; possibilty?

       Yes, we killed Lt. Keffer, one of our starfury pilot recurring
characters, and killed Talia's primary personality.

                                                                  jms
