<pre> Bernard F. Dowdy, J &lt;76550.347@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I probably know the answer to this already, but here goes: Have
&gt; you ever provided fans or viewers with any such documentation?

       "Have you ever provided fans or viewers with any such
documentation?" I think I need clarification here...documentation of
what?

       Also, if you did get a copy of the original email "digest" of
messages from here, was there an address on the point of origin, i.e.,
who was sending them around initially?

                                                                  jms
