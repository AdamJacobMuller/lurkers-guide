<h3>Date: 27-Mar-96 20:39:45</h3>
<pre> Troy Starr &lt;74752.3172@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Or, to put it another way, how often does the Council get new
&gt; members?

       Membership in the Grey Council is usually for life; a person
can choose to leave but only under truly extraordinary circumstances
(kind of like being appointed to the Supreme Court).  In Delenn's case,
though, remember that she didn't quit, she was booted out.

                                                                  jms
