<pre> Michael Zitaglio &lt;102545.641@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Does this mean that Franklin is backing Clarke?
&gt; Will we see which side Franklin chooses?

       Franklin is of the breed of officers who feels it isn't his
place to set policy, only to execute it.

                                                                  jms
