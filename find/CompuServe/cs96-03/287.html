<pre> Arwel Parry &lt;100336.623@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Since you're using a Latin title, does the fact that "vir" is the
&gt; Latin word for "man" have any significance?

       Yes, it's sort of a double pun in that respect...thus passes
the man, which can have many meanings, also entering manhood, or dying,
or going away, or the more Vir transitioning, or going...lots of
variations.

                                                                  jms
