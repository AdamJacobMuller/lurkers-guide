<pre> Fred Owens &lt;74051.3602@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Joe, Silly question probably but, is Minbari sexual physiology
&gt; completely compatible with human physiology?

       No, not under normal circumstances; it'd have to undergo some
fairly extensive genetic modifications before that could happen.

                                                                  jms
