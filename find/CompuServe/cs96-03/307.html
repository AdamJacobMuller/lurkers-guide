<pre> Bill Hirst &lt;104106.431@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; But who's out on the net every night talking to his fans?

       Kiddo, you gotta understand Da Biz, and in Da Biz, writers have
never been given the same influence or recognition as actors, and never
will. It's something you have to understand going in and accept,
because there ain't much you can do about it.

       And it's hard to fault that logically.  An actor's face is on
screen; the writer is invisible.  We all see what the actor does.  Most
folks still don't quite understand what a writer does, particularly in
TV.  Whenever I leave town, when I'm in a cab, or (less often because
fans are generally more informed) at a con, somebody'll hear what I do
and say, "So do you make up the story and the actors come up with the
dialogue?"  Some think that the TV writer puts the stuff together after
the actors and directors make the episode.

       They honestly, simply Don't Know and Don't Understand.  And you
can't take umbrage at that; it's simply the way it is.

       And whatever my participation on the nets may be, only one out
of a couple hundred people even *have* computers, and the number of
folks on the net are even smaller.  The general population still
doesn't notice this area as much as they will in a few more years.

                                                                  jms
