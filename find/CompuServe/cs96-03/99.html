<pre> Philip Hornsey &lt;74053.2101@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Do you think that this is some innocent person that reposted a
&gt; bunch of our material which was then grabbed by the Fullers, or
&gt; is this some twisted scheme?

       You must understand that because I'm not on rastb5, my info
comes secondhand.  My understanding, from TF's own statements, is that
this last round came about because of a mailer generated by people who
like trying to "mind-phuque" me, of which he is one, and is thus on the
list.  (The term is his, cleaned up for cis.)

       There are, on the other hand, other lists compiled by people
who're fans of the show, for general information purposes.  They should
not be considered in the same way, and as far as I can tell, they are
going to great lengths to do this the right way.

                                                                  jms
