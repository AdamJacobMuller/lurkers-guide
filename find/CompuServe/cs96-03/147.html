       We've always done everything in our power to assist our actors
in taking outside work when they're not needed in the show.  We let
Stephen Furst out of his contract enough to do "Misery Loves Company"
for Fox, and rearranged our shooting schedule days to accommodate him;
ditto when Peter Jurasik wanted time off to do "The Late Shift," and
Andreas when he wanted to do a recent movie project.

       The key is that we need *advance word* on these things; then we
can adjust the scripts and schedules.  If someone comes to us at the
last minute, we can't do much about that.

                                                                  jms
