<pre> James R. Kapesis &lt;104154.27@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; What, if anything, happened to the ship that originally
&gt; discovered the ruins of Z'ha'dum?

       As will be explained later this season, the ruins at Z'ha'dum
were detected by a long-range probe; same as the kind of probe IPX used
to find the other planet in "Mind War."

                                                                  jms
