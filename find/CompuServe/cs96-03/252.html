<H2>G'Lan/G'Len???</H2>
<h3>Date: 21-Mar-96 14:53:49</h3>
<pre> Chad Underkoffler &lt;102512.1310@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; was that G'Lan?
&gt; was that *also* G'Lan?
&gt; Or does there exist a "G'Len" and I'm just not hearing right?

       G'Lan was one of a number of higher Narn beings who appeared to
support G'Quan.  There is no G'Len, that's a misspelling of G'Lan.

                                                                  jms
