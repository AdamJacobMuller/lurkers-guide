<pre> Philip Hornsey &lt;74053.2101@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; When you find yourself asking the question "Why the hell did
&gt; Sheridan do this?"

       One reason for the continuity is because you don't have a lot
of different chefs in the kitchen.  The more you divide up the
direction of the show and parcel it out, the more contradictions are
going to emerge.  Also, by virtue of having the whole story forwards
and backwards in my head, when a question gets asked about a production
element, I just sorta mentally fast-forward or backward, see how it
fits in, and can say yes, no or give a correction.  Often on shows
you've got people going and coming in the command chair, and they may
not always know the background as well as they might.

                                                                  jms
