<pre> James R. Kapesis &lt;104154.27@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Were they part of the last conflict with the shadows?

       It was the fear of the shadows, among others, that compelled
them to start building up their war technology...with unfortunate
results.

                                                                  jms
