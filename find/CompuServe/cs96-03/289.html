<H2>Yr. 4 renewal</H2>
<h3>Date: 26-Mar-96 23:41:25</h3>
<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Do you have any specific plans?
&gt; Like releasing it in novel form, or unfilmed scripts?

       Let me rephrase this: I can't answer the question because I
can't allow the question to even exist in my head.

                                                                  jms
