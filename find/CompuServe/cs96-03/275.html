<pre> Jim De Vico &lt;72662.2765@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Are there any contingency plans in the event that B5 is not
&gt; picked up at any point along the story arc?

       I always have to operate on the assumption it will be picked
up, or it'll falter; this show is an act of sheer will.

                                                                  jms
