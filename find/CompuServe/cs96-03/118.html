       We'll give the info out when we've settled for sure on what
we're going to be charging, and offering, for the club.  (Unlike some
clubs, which charge as much as $20 or more, we're trying to keep it
down to something a little more reasonable, to keep it more accessible
to people.)

                                                                  jms
