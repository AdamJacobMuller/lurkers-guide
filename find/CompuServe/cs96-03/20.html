<h3>Date: 01-Mar-96 23:32:43</h3>
<pre> Mike Hoffmann &lt;100321.2604@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Only: what permanent remedy is there?
&gt; Legal action?
&gt; And who has the time or the means to pursue that?
&gt; Physical violence?

       There is no permanent solution; but people should be aware of
this, in case they do have a problem with it, so that they can at least
know it's going on...at most perhaps encourage those doing this to
cease by virtue of complaining about it to them or to their service
providers.

                                                                  jms
