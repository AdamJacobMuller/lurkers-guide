       "Everybody involved in B5 is in it for the money."

       Y'know, this with some of your other comments here -- using the
old canard of dismissing anyone who disagrees with you as "worshipping"
someone who creates or does a TV show -- amounts to some of the most
cynical crap I've seen in a long time.

       Here's a little revelation for you: Before doing B5, I was a
writer producer on MURDER, SHE WROTE.  A top-ten (sometimes even top 5)
rated megahit for CBS, with extremely high visibility.  I resigned M,SW
to take on the reins of a syndicated series, which pays me HALF WHAT I
EARNED WHEN I WAS ON M,SW. Not only is my producer's fee half what it
was when I was at the network, the scripts fees are ALSO far
less...about $15,000 as compared to $24,000 for a network script.  The
residuals are lower in syndication, the publicity budget is less,
people pay less attention to you in town.

       Now...why don't you just sit down and do the math, and poke
your head out of your butt long enough to consider that maybe, MAYBE,
some people do something because they're motivated by something other
than just being in it "for the money."  If I were "in it for the
money," I would've stayed with a hit network series for major bucks. 
If I were "in it for the money" I'd be pushing for more merchandising,
I'd *NEVER* have set a ceiling of 5 years on the show, and I'd
certainly never want to get away from TV and go back to writing novels
when this is all over, since books pay a fraction of TV.

       It's truly sad to see the world through your eyes, in which no
one does anything for reasons other than THE BUCKS...no story wanting
to be told, no art, no music, no committment, nothing other than sheer,
naked greed.

       Do not mistake cynicism for open-mindedness.  Yours is just
another form of prejudice.  One can be just as close-minded by assuming
the worst of others as by (to use your term) "worshipping."

                                                                  jms
