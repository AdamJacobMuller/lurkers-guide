<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Do you happen to know whether out of control budgets is what sank
&gt; "Live Shot?"

       I don't really know enough about that show to comment; the only
reason I know as much about the V series as I do is because, when they
brought me in to write the new miniseries, I was briefed on the
situation they'd had.

                                                                  jms
