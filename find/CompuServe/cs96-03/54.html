<pre>       Every once in a while, I get something along these lines,
though so far usually it's enough just to tell them to please back off
a little. Their desire is usually well-meaning, just...overly
enthusiastic.  For a while, I was getting 7-8 messages a day from a few
different people, in email, asking extremely detailed background
questions, literally dozens at a time, every day.  Eventually, I had to
ask some of them to just back away and stop it.  So far they have, some
with greater grace than others.

       A related problem I have sometimes is that people will send me
email with 5, 8, or 20 questions (literally), each question requiring
an elaborate explanation to be clear.  I don't think they understand
the sheer volume of email I get on a daily basis.  If a person sends me
one or two questions I can answer fairly briefly, they'll usually get
an answer.  If it's something like this, I go into overload, and either
say "sorry" or just don't reply. If I were to engage in that kind of
detailed email correspondence, I'd a) never have time for the show, and
b) 2/3rds of the rest of my email would never get answered.  It's hard
to fault them, because it's clear that their messages spring from real
interest in the show.  I just think they don't really understand how
*much* email I get on a daily basis.  (So in general, if it's a general
question of any sort, from which others might benefit from the answer, 
*always* post it publicly instead of emailing it.  This also saves me
from having to answer the same question in email 50 times.)

       Then there was the one person I told to avoid sending me email
with 15 questions...who solved the problem by sending me 15 emails with
1 question each.....

                                                                  jms
