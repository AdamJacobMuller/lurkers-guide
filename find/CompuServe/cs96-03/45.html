<pre>{original post had no questions}

       BTW, Peter, I happened to catch the episode tonight (though I
missed the opening and about 2-3 minutes at the top).  Nicely done.  I
still think I preferred the commander from the test episode (now it's
YOUR turn to hear that), but a lot has been improved, particularly the
sets, which are very elaborate and visually interesting.  Some fun
writing, good (if somewhat over the top) directing, and the effects
were quite good.  This one may actually have some shelf life....

       Congratulations.  You are now officially a Mogul.  Your
certificate of membership should arrive in a few days.

                                                                  jms
