<H2>Duck food?</H2>
<h3>Date: 12-Mar-96 14:47:30</h3>
<pre> Mark Sloan &lt;100407.3462@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Did someone once say negotiating with TV executives was "like
&gt; being nibbled to death by ducks"? If so, who was it?
&gt; Have I got the context right?

       I think it was Eric Severied of CBS News.

                                                                  jms
