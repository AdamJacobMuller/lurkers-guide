<pre> Lee McNeil &lt;101611.1440@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is this person *something* to do with the onslaught of Babylon 5
&gt; ? (When it goes BOOM!) And could it be that this person, *if* he
&gt; were to be attacking B5, using some sort of watered down
&gt; OrganicWeapon technology which EarthForce Defence/Research
&gt; devision got thier hands on at the end of "Infection" ?

       No, if I remember correctly, the person you're seeing works
station defense, laying down a fire line against incoming personnel.

                                                                  jms
