<pre> Brian A. Thomas &lt;75231.1122@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Have you heard if any B5 people will be there?
&gt; BTW, just saw a B5 shirt at a local hobby shop, what name should
&gt; be on the lable to see that it was an authorised printing?

       Yeah, in addition to me, Richard Biggs will be there, and one
other; unfortunately I've just forgotten who....

                                                                  jms
