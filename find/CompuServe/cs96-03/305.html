       Yes, indeed, you've sussed it out.  I *am* from the future.
Unfortunately, I'm only from 15 seconds into the future, so it doesn't
do me a bit of good, except being able to more accurately cut out
commercials while taping "The Simpsons."

                                                                  jms
