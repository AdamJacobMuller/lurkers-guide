       Actually, a CDrom screen saver is *already out* from Sound
Sources; info can be had in one of the B5 libraries.  Beyond that, a B5
encyclopedia is still in the works for CDrom, though not finalized yet.
Also, Christopher Franke, our composer, will be doing a second B5
soundtrack and a CDrom to go with it.

                                                                  jms
