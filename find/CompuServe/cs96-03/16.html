<pre> Joel Hilke &lt;102354.1702@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; And what's your problem with that?

       "B5 has gravity defying video cameras"

       Only if you consider a plane or any other reasonable technology
of flight to be gravity defying.

       The video recorders are made of an extremely ultralight
material, new alloys that in total weighs less than an ounce; it has a
visible (and audible) air propulsion system, a high speed fan with a
stabalizer/gyroscope that keeps it steady, and move it forward.

                                                                  jms
