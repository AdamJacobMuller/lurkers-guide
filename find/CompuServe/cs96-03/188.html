<pre> Al Lipscomb &lt;75204.2225@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Could this mean that by the time the games comes out you will
&gt; have finished showing us the aliens and are moveing along with
&gt; other things?

       I think I can work out how much info to put in and still leave
me with other areas to bring out new stuff, and there'll likely be
supplements and subsequent reference works later that incorporate new
stuff anyway.

                                                                  jms
