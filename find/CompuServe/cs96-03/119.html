<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; So this would be a bad time to set-up as a life insurance
&gt; salesman on B5?

       The key to writing an ensemble show is to use those characters
that serve the story, and for no other reason, not becuase you think
they should get more on-air time for egos or any other rationale.

                                                                  jms
