<H2>VQT Ratings &amp;Endorsement</H2>

<pre> William H. DiPaola &lt;76521.1751@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Joe, Care to make a comment about this?
&gt; Just heard from Pigdog that VQT took a full page out in a trade
&gt; publication listing the endorsed shows and, well, guess what?

       Yes, we had this confirmed in Friday's Daily Variety; Viewers
for Quality Television has added B5 to its short list of qualified
endorsed shows, along with Murphy Brown, 60 Minutes, Dr. Quinn Medicine
Woman and about 10 others.  It's a definite recognition of the quality
of the show.

                                                                  jms
