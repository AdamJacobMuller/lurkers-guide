       Nope, the time I spend here is on my own dime in terms of time
invested.  Wouldn't have it any other way.

       And yes, there will be a B5 rpg coming out later this year, and
yes, as with all licensed B5 products, I'll be involved in the
development process.

                                                                  jms
