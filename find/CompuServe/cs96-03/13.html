<pre> Mike Hoffmann &lt;100321.2604@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Wouldn't doing so vastly exxagerate their importance - and be
&gt; just what they want? How could anything I or others on this forum
&gt; write be harmful to you or the show? Put it another way: is it
&gt; worth it? Is there any indication they have harmfully falsified
&gt; the posts of this forum?

       No, I don't mind if my messages get reposted all over; I've
long ago given permission for anything I write to get reposted
anywhere.  It's just that others have been having their stuff reposted,
without their knowing, and I find it vastly inappropriate to do so
without the courtesy of even letting them know.  It's a real breach of
trust.

                                                                  jms
