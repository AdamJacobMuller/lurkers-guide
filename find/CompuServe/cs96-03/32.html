       No, Stephen, you've got that backward.  We had booked Foxworth
long in advance.  Later, out of the blue, a rep for the actor said that
by accident he'd been double-booked on B5 and DS9 for the same
period...and even though we had prior claim, because the other was a
two-parter, more money, they went for that.  One can only wonder when
the other offer *really* came in....

                                                                  jms
