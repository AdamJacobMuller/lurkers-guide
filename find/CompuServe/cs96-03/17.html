<pre> John L. Creigh &lt;75270.423@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Was that your intent?

       It's more universal than that.  Any time there's a big disease,
we get Stupid.  The same exact thing happened with the Black Plague, as
was mentioned in the episode...instead of blaming gays, the leaders of
the time blamed jews and lepers.  The whole *point* is to drop politics
and scapegoating whichEVER disease it happens to be next...and there is
always a next...and focus on the problem: the disease.

                                                               jms
