       THE (EVEN MORE!) COMPLETE BOOK OF SCRIPTWRITING will be
available at most any decent-sized bookstore when it comes out this
Fall, as well as via direct-order from Writer's Digest Books.  I
haven't received a final price tag or ISBN number yet.  I opted to
include the script for "The Coming of Shadows," since that seems to be
the most favorite overall thus far, though I suspect that may change
later this season.

                                                                  jms
