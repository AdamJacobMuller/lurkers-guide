       We'll hear more on Na'Toth this season.

       Laurel was, as stated in the series, transferred to the Rim.

       Dr. Kyle, as stated in the series, was transferred back to
Earth.

       Talia was sent back to the Psi Corps as stated in the series.

       Bureau 13 changed it's name and was absorbed into the whole Psi
Corps covert operation.  Secret organizations are constantly changing
their names. Homeguard has been absorbed into Nightwatch.

       The fate of B4 will be shown this season.

                                                                  jms
