<pre> Joe Salemi [ZD Net] &lt;72631.23@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Ta'Lon's line about "All answers are replies, but not all replies
&gt; are answers" -- is that from something else (a paraphrase
&gt; perhaps)?

       No, I don't think that's a quote from anywhere but the show, at
least insofar as I know.

                                                                  jms
