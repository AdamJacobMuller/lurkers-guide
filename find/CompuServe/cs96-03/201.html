<pre> James R. Kapesis &lt;104154.27@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; My question is why hasn't any new B5 comics come out yet?
&gt; What is the delay and do you still have a contract with DC?

       Basically, we hit a snag we're trying currently to work out;
it's a jurisdictional question between B5/WB and DC.  Business stuff. 
I haven't yet heard a final disposition on this.

                                                                  jms
