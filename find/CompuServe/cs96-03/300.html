<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; So,....What is it with you and San Diego anyway?
&gt; Did you lose you luggage there or something?

       I used to live in San Diego, first from 1971-1972, then from
1974 until 1981.  It's my way of sort of nodding at my old stomping
grounds.

                                                                  jms
