<pre> Theo Thourson &lt;73214.2131@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Full length or one act?

       I tend to write both full-length and one-act plays, depending
on the requirements of the topic.  I've had about a dozen produced (a
mix of both lengths), and one published (and no, I won't tell you
where, because I was only 18-19 when I wrote it, and that it's still in
print leave me chagrined no end).

       I actually tend to write just about anything; I enjoy working
in, and have sold in, every form of prose: short stories, novels,
anthologies, articles, investigative pieces, nonfiction books, even
songs.  The one thing at which I'm *truly* awful however is poetry.

                                                                  jms
