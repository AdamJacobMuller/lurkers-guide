       Exactly.  And that's the point that a few non-writers make when
they go after that aspect.  Writing is fluid...if you alter course a
little, it's usually because you found a better way to do something. 
This is done all the time, in every conceivable art form.

       Also, the B5 basic storyline was conceived by me in 1986/87; I
was a fairly good writer then, I'm better now...it's almost 10 years
later, and I've written a lot of stuff, learned more about my craft,
and the writer of 1996 has some better ideas of how to do things than
the writer of 1986.  I'd be a fool to stick to every single note from
10 years ago if I think of a better way to do it now; the goal is to
tell the story as effectively as humanly possible, not to be rigid.

                                                                  jms
