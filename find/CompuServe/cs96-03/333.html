<h3>Date: 31-Mar-96 14:04:47</h3>
<pre> James R. Kapesis &lt;104154.27@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Two questions about it, was Delenn in the Whitestar when she came
&gt; to defend B5? Also, are any of the new fighters that B5 is taking
&gt; on the new starfuries?

       Yes, the push in on Delenn revealed her in the White Star, and
yes, a fair number of the new 'furies B5 inherited are Thunderbolt
class.

                                                                  jms
