<pre> Cherns Major &lt;75026.3723@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Can you say, "Blessed are the cheesemakers"?

       No, actually, it's neither annoying nor irritating to have all
my posts archived.  For starters, it keeps me honest; I don't think
I've ever been caught out in a major contradiction.  It shows the
progression of events, and chronicles how a show is made for
educational purposes.

       (Since some are opting out of being reposted, I'm going to try
to make my replies here more reflective, so they can be followed even
without any supporting messages.)

                                                                  jms
