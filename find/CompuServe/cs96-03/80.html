<pre>       Not a problem, Kevin.  You've usually been quite fair.

       (I agree about Penn and Teller...love 'em.  They're just nuts.)

       I can see no reason not to oblige Brent and John Hardin with
their requests for reposting from my side of it; these are, of course,
issues of privacy, the latitude and longditude of which are
circumscribed by the quiet turning of your own considered conscience. 
If you don't mind, then say yes; if you do mind, then say no.

       As for the masks, yes, I believe they're the licensed ones from
Ruby.

                                                                  jms
