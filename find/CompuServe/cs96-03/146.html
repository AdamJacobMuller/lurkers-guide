<h3>Date: 10-Mar-96 23:28:49</h3>
<pre> Kevin P. Kenney &lt;104102.352@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Any thoughts on your next step in this in-joke-a-thon?
&gt; Will you wait for Peter to do a year 4 script, or might something
&gt; crop up this year?

       I haven't yet decided...though I have some ideas...and a few of
them are *real* doozies.

                                                                  jms
