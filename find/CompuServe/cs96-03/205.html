<H2>_WHAT_ uniforms?</H2>

       The basic Ranger uniform can't be *too* specific and uniform in
every case, or it defeats the purpose of a more or less covert group. 
But the silhouette is the cloak, the dark colors, a cowl, and the pin
worn over the right breast.  (We'll have more on the pin and its
meaning in the next batch of episodes.)

                                                                  jms
