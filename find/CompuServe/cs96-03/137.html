<H2>B5: 5 or 6 years?</H2>

       A stand-alone TV movie really can't be an arc in the same sense
as a season of the show.  So I can't really consider it "a year."  A
year of story time equals one year of real time.  That's the five year
arc, which refers to the *series*, to that specific one-to-one ratio. 
The movie I've always considered to be a preface, or introduction...The
Hobbit, if you will, to The Lord of the Rings.  If it were going to a
sixth year arc, then it should've covered a span of a year; but it only
covered a few days.

                                                                  jms
