<pre> Elyse M. Grasso &lt;70302.3304@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Have you ever read "Goedel Escher Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid"
&gt; by Douglas Hofstadter?

       Have read some of Goedel's work, but not enough to be even
remotely conversant about it.

       Yes, a lot of stuff is coming together in the story now.  We've
set up a lot over the last 2 years, now is the time to begin paying it
all off, resolving threads left hanging, and moving the show to a
different level. So a lot of stuff has to hit the fan here over the
balance of this season.

                                                                  jms
