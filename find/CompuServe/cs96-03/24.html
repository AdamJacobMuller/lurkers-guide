<H2>Season 3 and Na'Toth</H2>
<h3>Date: 02-Mar-96 19:09:59</h3>
<pre> Automedia, Inc. &lt;70530.2521@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; A question from my friend Vince: "Now that you've written all of
&gt; the season 3 scripts, can you tell us how things might have been
&gt; different had Na'Toth stayed in the storyline?"

       The story arc would've stayed the same; but the character
would've had some good moments, and helped move it along.

                                                                  jms
