       It's either their ignorance or they don't care...but you're
correct, in the B5 universe you can't have two races interbreeding just
like that. (In fact, I seem to recall pointing this out in my notes on
the manuscript; odd that it hasn't been attended to, from what you're
saying.  I can only assume that it slipped between the cracks.)

                                                                  jms
