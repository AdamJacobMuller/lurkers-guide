       Gerald, the reality is that as humans, we're all flawed. 
Errors and inconsistencies in something as big as a novel, written by
someone who doesn't work on the show, isn't involved in it day to day,
are gong to slip through. That is inevitable.  I try to keep track of
it all, read as much as I can, to keep it in line, but the *only* way
to keep it 100% canon is to invest all the time I currently spend doing
that on the series, which is a 24 hour a day job.

       A writer comes in, has a notion for a book, or gets one
assigned to him; the writer then goes away and around that notion
writes 100,000 words or so.  I don't see it again until the finished
manuscript comes in, almost always at the last minute.  The *only* way
to make sure that every word of that is canon is to work hand in glove
with the writer through every page. The reason the B5 series is as
consistent as it is, is because that's what I do, day in and day out.

       So the broad strokes are always going to be pretty much
consistent with the series; of the next batch, we'll probably do some
backstory in the B5 universe taken from my notes.  But some of the
details will always be off a bit, because you're turning the work over
to the hands of others.  There is simply no other way to do it short of
my adding Editor and Publisher to my list of hats.

                                                                  jms
