       Yes, you've caught them exactly.

       With Ivanova, I've tried to construct a small emotional arc, in
that when she arrived, she was the new kid, she was a bit uncomfortable
with the job, and responded by being very formal, very businesslike, a
bit on the snide side.  As she's gotten more comfortable with the job,
and the people around her, she's relaxed a bit around her
co-workers...but if somebody crosses her, as Bester tends to do, she
lets fly with some pretty sharp lines.

                                                                  jms
