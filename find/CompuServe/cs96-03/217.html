       Yes, I tend to agree.  Lately we've spent a lot of time on the
Narns and the Centauri from a cultural point of view, so the latter
part of this season swings a bit back in the direction of the Minbari,
allowing us to learn a little more about them, their approach to war,
relationships, their political structure and so on.

       And of course, the middle batch we've been in lately has
focused a lot on Earth, so we can deal with the whole Nightwatch/Clark
scenario before moving back into broader questions.

       I tend to write toward (for lack of a better term) musical
structure; one theme in the piece rises for a while, dominates, then
slowly diminishes for a bit while another theme comes forward...then
you have several rising all at once...interludes and
crescendos...broken here and there by the single clear note, the
non-arc story, which sustains us between the major pieces and greater
musical themes.

                                                                  jms
