<pre> Philip Hornsey &lt;74053.2101@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; What was it's final condition, and which side is Stephen's father
&gt; on?

       Stephen's father is a by-the-book guy; he doesn't think his job
is to set policy, only to implement policy.

                                                                  jms
