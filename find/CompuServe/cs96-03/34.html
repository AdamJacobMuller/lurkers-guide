<pre> Randy Upshaw &lt;75464.1275@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I don't see that that has anything to do with the b5 story line?
&gt; By the way were are the shadows???

       "I don't believe a conservative nightwatch would be tolerated
either."

       Senator Joseph McCarthy.  The House Un-American Activities
Committee. You can look it up.

       Also, there was a PBS documentary this past week on the
blacklist; I suggest that ANYone who thinks we would never fall for
something like the Nightwatch should take a look at it.  It makes the
Nightwatch look pale by comparison.

                                                                  jms
