<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; At that point, I guess I would wonder out loud what difference it
&gt; makes if my public words are seen merely by the hundreds in here,
&gt; or the many hundreds or thousands "out there"? But the messages I
&gt; wrote with the expectation of their being read by hundreds of
&gt; strangers anyway??? Does the idea that hundreds *more* might see
&gt; them bother me?

       Which is exactly the point.  If you're not bothered in the
least, then it isn't an issue.  It just seemed fair and proper to
notify those who *might* have a problem with it, and some did.  It just
allows people to make informed choices.

                                                                  jms
