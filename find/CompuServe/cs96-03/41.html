       Absolutely.  You're quite right.  The other digest of my
messages is a fine and fair thing, because I've said that my messages
can be reposted anywhere, anytime.  It's others who have not given
their permission, and the messages involved, that they may need to be
made aware of.  (Darn, ended on a dangling preposition....)

                                                                  jms
