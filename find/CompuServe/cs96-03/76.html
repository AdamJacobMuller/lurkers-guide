<pre>       No, I'm not going anywhere as far as B5 is concerned; we'll
have some freelance scripts coming in in years 4 and 5, but that's just
the same as in years 1 and 2.  They'll almost certainly be based on
assigned premises, and in all cases, I rewrite to make sure it all
hangs together.

                                                                  jms
