9) imbalance in the Grey Council

Will be dealt with this season.

10) the Underground Railroad

Will be elaborated upon and brought to the fore later this season.

11) Lady Morella's vision

C'mon..."unresolved?"  It was only mentioned for the first time in the
last new episode.  Gimme some time here, I'm dancing as fast as I can.

(Some more on this later this season.)

12) What Kosh really looks like

More on this later this season, in an important way.

13) Sinclair not the One, but he will be

In the fullness of time.

15) Londo's prophetic dream

More this season, in detail.

16) Where Bester stands (to be decided in Ship of Tears, later this
year!)

Yes, this season.

17)  Minbari souls

Also this season.

       See, this is the thing that I have to shake my head at when
people use terms like "unresolved plot lines" or "dropped threads;" the
story ain't done yet.  You only use that term when you've finished the
book, and stuff is left hanging.  We're only midway through the book --
not even that yet in what's been broadcast -- it's a little premature
to start announcing threads or plots as unresolved.  There's an ebb and
flow to the threads, they're brought in and out as needed.

       You can't reference every single thread in the show in every
episode, or you'd just have an hour of people sitting around and
reciting updates on all the various positions.

       I don't like leaving loose threads hanging around.  And I
don't.  We will hear more about Na'Toth soon, because it's time to
mention that again, as an important storyline element.  (Somebody
commented that it's being mentioned because folks have been
asking...no, I don't work that way.  It's been asked for ages now. 
People have been asking for n'grath, and I ain't moving on that one. 
The few who've tossed this my way, that because they asked they forced 
me to deal with it, are like the roosters who think their sounds at
morning are directly responsible for the sunrise.)

       In any event, to this issue...be patient.  This isn't about
immediate gratification.  There's a certain pacing in the show in the
ways in which story elements come and go, which would be more apparent
if the show were being broadcast more steadily, without breaks.  Yeah,
there've been two months almost since Lady Morella's prophecy, but
there *haven't even been any new episodes aired yet*, and it was only
aired in the last new epsiode out of the blocks, so how can it be a
dropped plotline?

       At the beginning of year one, a lot of folks were saying,
"Where's the arc?  Huh?  Where's this `overarching storyline' we've
been led to expect? Huh?  It ain't here."  Then they saw it bigtime
starting with "Sky," and eventually realized that some elements of what
they were seeing had ALREADY STARTED the arc...they just hadn't
realized it until they looked back.  "Oh, yeah...THERE it was."

       Others said, "What happened to that alien ship that blew up the
Raiders in "Signs?"  They were just thrown in there to shake things up,
and then they dropped it, I hate it when shows do that.  It's a cheat."
Oh, you mean the SHADOW VESSEL that has now formed the main core of
year three and a lot of year two?

       In this list of "unresolved plot lines" I haven't yet seen one
that we're not either dealing with, or planning to deal with shortly. 
I would suggest we perhaps table this approach until the work is done,
since only at that time can you say, positively, "THIS is an unresolved
plot line," since we've hit the resolution of the story then.  Until
then, it's an exercise in "who didn't cross the finish line?" halfway
through the marathon.

                                                                  jms
