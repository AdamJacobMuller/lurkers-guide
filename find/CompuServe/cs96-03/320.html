<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; I'm currently on a debate on Vorlonspeak, so why not go to the
&gt; source? Do Corlon's speak in music, and the translator turns it
&gt; into English?

       They speak in tones, almost a chorus of voices.

                                                                  jms
