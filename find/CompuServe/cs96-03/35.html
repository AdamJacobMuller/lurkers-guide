<pre> Cherns Major &lt;75026.3723@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; This discussion (about a spoiler for Point of No Return) brings a
&gt; question to my mind: where do TVGuide and other publications get
&gt; their little capsule descriptions, anyway? I don't presume that
&gt; TVGuide has a screening room where they watch all programs that
&gt; will be aired in a month or so, just to come up with little
&gt; five-line descriptions; wouldn't there be some sort of system in
&gt; which the station provides these descriptions along with their
&gt; schedules? And, assuming that stations themselves don't have
&gt; description-writing screening panels (or even advance access, in
&gt; many cases, I imagine), wouldn't these descriptions come from the
&gt; program source itself? Which brings up another question: are
&gt; episode titles usually provided for shows that have them, and why
&gt; aren't these listed? Or am I 'way off track in all this supposing?

       Synopses come from one of two places: 1) a two-page synopsis
from the studio/network, or 2) scripts provided to TV Guide by same.

                                                                  jms
