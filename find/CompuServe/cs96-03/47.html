       Good heavens, Karen, there was nothing in your message to be
offended *at*.  I took the inquiry at face value, and answered it thus.

       Glad you enjoyed "Point."  It sets everything up, so we can
knock it all down in "Severed Dreams."  Now everyhing I need is right
where I need it to be....

                                                                  jms
