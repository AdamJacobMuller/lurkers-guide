<H2>Just a Question</H2>
<h3>Date: 17-Mar-96 02:04:43</h3>
<pre> Michael E. MacDonal &lt;102371.1166@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; and was wondering which one it was?
&gt; and if this Caused a great deal of changes to accomadate the cast
&gt; on his Arm ?

       The arm broken was his right arm and wrist; we worked it into
the show, in a way which actually worked well with what went right
before it. Jerry's doing fine now.

                                                                  jms
