<pre> Chad Underkoffler &lt;102512.1310@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; (aside) *ONE* of?
&gt; How does that sound?
&gt; At one time, wasn't the G'Quon/G'Lan situation outline to us
&gt; netted folks as similar to what happened with Islam after the
&gt; Prophet got "translated"? Rage Ranger of Washingdome "Book of
&gt; G'kar?

       Oh, the Vorlons can be *very* invasive, when they want to be,
if it suits their purposes.  There's no Vorlon prime directive...it's
manipulation, whether small or large.

                                                                  jms
