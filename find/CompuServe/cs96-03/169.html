       I think they have the potential to become very popular, if done
right; if they're treated as novels, which means you're going to be
tied to the quality of the person telling the story.  If it's just done
as a gimmick, then arc-series won't hit it.  My sense is that since
over the next few years series may end up having shorter runs due to
the massive amount of available programming, why not build it to turn
that to an advantage?
