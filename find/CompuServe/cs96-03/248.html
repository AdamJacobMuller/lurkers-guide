<pre> James R. Kapesis &lt;104154.27@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Now that Sheridan is allied with Kosh, does he plan to ask Kosh
&gt; what happened to the Earth ships that went into Vorlon space? Or
&gt; does he believe what the Vorlons said about the ships having
&gt; accidents?

       He would probably ask that of Kosh, if there were time, and
circumstance to think of it.  It's hard to bring that sort of thing up
unless it ties into an episode; otherwise it's just a forced sort of
thing.

                                                                  jms
