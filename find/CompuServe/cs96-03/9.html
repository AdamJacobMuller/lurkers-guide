<pre> Steve Ramage &lt;74731.235@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Carter?

       I agree; Fry's work must be read or heard aloud to be most
fully appreciated.  It has a wonderful cadence, and the vocablary is
really quite extraordinary.  Some of his imagery is amazing.  I don't
know if Marcus is so much in that vein as it might be, but there are
probably some influences here and there.  Certainly when he winds up he
can pick up some of that cadence....

                                                                  jms
