<pre> Philip Hornsey &lt;74053.2101@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Incidently, what were Londo's first two choices?

       Centauri are always suspicious, and if you knew you might be
emperor after the other is dead, you might be encourage to...help that
process along, however you might like someone.  It's just good
business.

                                                                  jms
