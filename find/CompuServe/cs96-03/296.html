<H2>Lost Threads?</H2>
<h3>Date: 27-Mar-96 12:28:50</h3>
<pre> Philip Hornsey &lt;74053.2101@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Regarding changes that have been made, if Pat had not become
&gt; available, and if AT had not chosen to leave, would Talia have
&gt; been Control and then come back later with an altered
&gt; personality, or was the Control thing a trapdoor (set up from the
&gt; beginning with the mirrors and such) that you *could* spring
&gt; *only if you needed to*?

       I'm busy enough on the threads that are happening...if I get
into all the threads that might happen I think my head will explode....

                                                                  jms
