<pre> David Nedrow &lt;70004.1273@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Does this give you any leverage with PTEN on renewals for
&gt; season's four and five?

       No, the TNT situation doesn't really impact the PTEN decision
overall, though certainly I expect they'd like to get at least 88
episodes out of it.

                                                                  jms
