<pre> James R. Kapesis &lt;104154.27@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; How do they decide which design to wear?
&gt; Is it based on rank or just personal preference?

       Some elements are very traditional, and many opt for that
aspect of Ranger clothing; others go for something more modern, or find
a middle ground.

                                                                  jms
