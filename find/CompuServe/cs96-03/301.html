<pre> (blocked) asks:

&gt; Sin wreak-oar ` Mistie, Montie, PITAS, Emperor of COWDP and
&gt; Kidism Patroler You've probably wondered in the past, "How can he
&gt; have Montie in his sig, yet never have used a single Python
&gt; line?"

       Correct, the critter in "Knives" was most *definitely* not a
Vorlon.
