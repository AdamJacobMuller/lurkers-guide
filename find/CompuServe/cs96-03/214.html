<pre> James R. Kapesis &lt;104154.27@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Since Lyta had so much trouble contacting the Vorlon homeworld,
&gt; how was G'Kar able to do it in "The Gathering"?

       Contacting the Vorlon government isn't the hard part; getting
into and out of their space is what's hard.  We showed in the pilot
that B5 and Earth were in *contact* with the Vorlons; Lyta was trying
to get inside their turf, and they aren't exactly neighborly in that
respect.

                                                                  jms
