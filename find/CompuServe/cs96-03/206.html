<H2>Drazi Question...</H2>
<h3>Date: 17-Mar-96 02:04:40</h3>
<pre> Chad Underkoffler &lt;102512.1310@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Does the Drazi Ambassador (Kim Strauss) have a name, and if so,
&gt; what is it? Ob JMSRequest: More Drazi, plis?

       Yes, the Drazi ambassador has a name, and we've used it, but
I'll be darned if I can remember it right now.  Just fell out of my
head.  (It was used in the episode where we have the mediation by
Delenn between the Drazi and Londo.)

                                                                  jms
