<pre> Philip Hornsey &lt;74053.2101@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; So this would have been made *instead* of the *amazingly*
&gt; pathetic series?

       This would've followed the last version, and have been truer to
the original miniseries.

                                                                  jms
