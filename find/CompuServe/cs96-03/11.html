<pre> John Hardin &lt;74076.22@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Hey, Joe, why can't *your* sci-fi show finagle a special tribute
&gt; to itself on an awards show? Or arrange a sketch on late-night TV
&gt; with Jay Leno on its set, being stupid with one of its
&gt; characters? Or have two of its principles slum out of a camper in
&gt; the boondocks, appear between sections of a movie (say, "The Four
&gt; Seasons") on a Saturday afternoon and make insipid comments about
&gt; the movie, and have pleas to watch B5 interspersed, disguised as
&gt; network identification? And how come you can't manage to produce
&gt; even a single B5 episode with a tidy, formula plot and a preachy,
&gt; politically correct moral that's about as subtle as a freight
&gt; train? Creative, well-thought storylines; thought-provoking
&gt; exploration of important issues that resist the urge for easy
&gt; answers; intense drama and intelligent comedy; insight into
&gt; individuals and societies; dynamite special effects; complex,
&gt; three-dimensional yet believable characters, excellently
&gt; portrayed by top-notch actors: just how far do you think that
&gt; *these* will take you?

       I strongly suspect that one of us needs to lie down for a long,
long time....

                                                                  jms
