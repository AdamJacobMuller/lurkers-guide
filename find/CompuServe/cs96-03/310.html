<pre> James R. Kapesis &lt;104154.27@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Can Kosh speak on his own to other people in their language or
&gt; does his encounter suite translate his Vorlon language for him so
&gt; he can be understood? Is this why in "Fall of the Night" when
&gt; Sheridan asked if the person who saved him was Kosh, all Kosh did
&gt; was nod because he couldn't speak on his own?

       His encounter suit translates vorlon into english; he can
converse just fine with other vorlons without it.

                                                                  jms
