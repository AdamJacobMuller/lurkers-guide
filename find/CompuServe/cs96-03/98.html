<pre> Philip Hornsey &lt;74053.2101@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Trying to give the guy the benifit of the doubt (he's had a
&gt; pretty damn rough last few months after all), but would it not
&gt; have been professional to at least give you guys a couple of
&gt; scenes to tie up characters threads?

       It wasn't workable, due to his schedule.

                                                                  jms
