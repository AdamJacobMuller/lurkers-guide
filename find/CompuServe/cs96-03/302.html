<pre>{original post had no questions}

       I don't think I flamed anyone...certainly I don't think the
person to whom I was responding felt particularly flamed.  When I set
out to flame, there ain't a whole lot of ambiguity about it.  I was
stating the background to the situation firmly, and indicating the
frustration brought about by *the question*, not the person.

       I did not consider the original question a flame in my
direction, nor did I consider my response a flame in the other
direction.  If I stated the issue strongly, it's likely because I know
that any time I leave a message, it generally gets cross-posted to a
zillion other systems, so in a way it becomes "talking to the room," so
the wider audience will know the full background of the
situation...thus helping to avoid having to go into the situation in
great detail multiple times.

       If the person to whom I was "speaking" feels flamed, he should
let me know and I will apologize, as that was not my intent.  If not,
then it's a moot question.

                                                                  jms
