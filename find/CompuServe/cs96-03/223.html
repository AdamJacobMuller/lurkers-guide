<pre> SysOp Lee Whiteside &lt;76711.2660@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; ANy chance TNT might move up the start of their airings?

       The broadcast stations which are a part of PTEN feel that if it
aired now on TNT as well it'd be competition that would dilute their
ratings.

                                                                  jms
