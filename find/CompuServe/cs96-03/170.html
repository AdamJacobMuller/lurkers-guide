       Well, you've just asked two questions disgused as one; why do
*I* feel I need to tell this story, and why should this story *need* to
be told.

       I need to tell this story because it won't let go.  The only
way to get rid of it is to tell it.  Because I think it may be
important.  It needs to be told because I think it has some ideas we
need to hear, and because it's time somebody did a saga like this to
help reinterpret some myths at a time when we very badly need our
myths.

                                                                  jms
