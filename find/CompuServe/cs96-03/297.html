       Thanks.  It's just as much fun for me.  To the waiting...I try,
where I can, to resolve any question raised within the course of the
coming year, rather than trying to stretch it out much beyond that. 
One question gets answered, another question looms.  There've been a
few exceptions, but overall I think we've pretty well stuck with that
model.

                                                                  jms
