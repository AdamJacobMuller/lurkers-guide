<pre> John Hardin &lt;74076.22@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; However, given this policy, how do you respond to questions
&gt; emailed to your CIS address?

       It's an awful bind there as well.  Up until now, I've been
responding to most of my email.  I guess I consider email different
than a public posting, because anyone can direct email anyone without
having to use an intermediary to post in a forum.  And it's a private
communication.

                                                                  jms
