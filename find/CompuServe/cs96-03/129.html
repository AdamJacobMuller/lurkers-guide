<pre> Fred Owens &lt;74051.3602@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; For the record, what is the status of the security forces on B5?
&gt; Are they EA or are they rent-a-cops hired by Sinclair to manage
&gt; his security when he took over due to the problems on the other B
&gt; stations?

       No, they're attached to the Earth Alliance and responsive to
those commands.

                                                                  jms
