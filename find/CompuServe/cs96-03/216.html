       The fan club was authorized a few weeks back, and we're in the
process now of finalizing all pertinent (and impertinent) elements;
price (we're trying to keep it under $15 to allow maximum
accessibility), what's going into the first membership kit, setting up
an account, that sort of thing.

                                                                  jms
