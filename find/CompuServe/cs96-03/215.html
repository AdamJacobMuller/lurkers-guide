<H2>Mr. Morden</H2>
<h3>Date: 17-Mar-96 19:07:19</h3>
<pre> James R. Kapesis &lt;104154.27@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Morden as the same person who asked him "What do you want?"
&gt; " in "Signs and Portents"?

       G'Kar probably has not yet put that together; remember, he only
met Morden once, for about 4 minutes, a couple of years previous to
this.

                                                                  jms
