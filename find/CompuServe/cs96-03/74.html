<pre>       Yeah, I also heard that Paramount sent the US Navy a letter
claiming that they owned the copyright to the term USS Enterprise, and
that the Navy should cease and desist from using that name in future.

       The Navy told 'em to stick it where the sun don't shine.

                                                                  jms
