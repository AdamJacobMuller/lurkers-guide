<pre> Edward Sykes &lt;101632.3501@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I have another question :- At the start of season 2 when Sinclair
&gt; was reassigned, what happened to Catherine, who he got engaged to
&gt; at the end of season 1?

       They had to break it off...he had responsibilities that
excluded that kind of relationship.

                                                                  jms
