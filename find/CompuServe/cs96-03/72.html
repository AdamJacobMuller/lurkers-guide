<pre>       Just so we're clear...the problem is primarily with the mailer
set up by the Hall Brothers, who were picking, choosing and editing
threads for the express purpose of providing "ammo" to use by others in
the Let's Get B5 and JMS arena.  It's that use that had to be
addressed, and it's spilled over into the other mailers.

       The flip side is that this *is* a legitimate issue, and had to
be dealt with one way or another.  I would also rather it hadn't come
out in this way, but when the stuff is out there, it has the potential
for misuse; it was inevitable that it would *be* misused...and now it
has.  Once again, the Usual Few misuse the system and cause more grief
and emotion in a situation that could've been dealt with differently.

                                                                  jms
