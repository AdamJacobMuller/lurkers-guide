<H2>Sci Fi Buzz Interview</H2>
<h3>Date: 29-Mar-96 20:31:59</h3>
<pre> James R. Kapesis &lt;104154.27@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Could you tell me what episode it was that they showed scenes
&gt; from? I notice that Sheridan has longer hair now, is that part of
&gt; the storyline or did Boxleitner do it on his own?

       Not having seen the episode yet, I can't tell where the scene
came from.  And the styles do get a bit looser with time....

                                                                  jms
