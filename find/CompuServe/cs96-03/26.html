<pre> Chris Croughton &lt;100014.3217@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; So has that last name caused you problems, or has it been an
&gt; advantage in that people recognise it?

       The name's probably been a slight disadvantage from time to
time, but not significantly so.

                                                                  jms
