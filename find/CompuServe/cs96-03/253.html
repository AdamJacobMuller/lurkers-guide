       Except I don't think it's actually a story idea, but rather
qualifies as parody (of a sort).  Also, I've never said I'd go after
anybody who posts story ideas, because I can't do that; I can only
leave any forum where they come up.  I can't interfere with that. 
Actual *published* fiction that infringes is another matter entirely,
of course.

                                                                  jms
