<pre> Ray Pelzer &lt;70475.1263@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Remember the stuff about the actual latitude and longitude of
&gt; "Area 51" being burned into the Newton 2.0 operating system, and
&gt; a CIA cryptographer found it, and they pressured Apple to remove
&gt; it from the time zones utility?

       How odd that they would be so concerned about a base that, they
say, doesn't even exist....

                                                                  jms
