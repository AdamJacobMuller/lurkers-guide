<pre> Al Lipscomb &lt;75204.2225@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Will we see any direct conflict between the Vorlon and the
&gt; Shadows in the arc? Of course we would all like to see the epic
&gt; space battle with the super races fighting it out ('battle of
&gt; five armies'), but is that the flavor of the war?

       It's fair to say that sooner or later, probably sooner, the
Vorlons are going to have to get more involved...but mark this, be
careful what you ask for....
