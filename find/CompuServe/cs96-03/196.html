<pre> Charles S. Tritt &lt;70254.131@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Will Katherine (sp?) be coming with you to Marcon?
&gt; What is she doing to stay busy these days?

       Still working out my Marcon plans.  Kathryn spends a great deal
of her time tracking all the stuff that needs to be done while I'm lost
in the B5 writing/producing process.  I'm nudging her to get back into
her own writing more, though having done it once she doesn't seem
interested in another foray into writing an episode of B5.  But there
are other options we're looking into....

                                                                  jms
