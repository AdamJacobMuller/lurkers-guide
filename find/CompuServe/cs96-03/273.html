       Yes, as your stats noted, it's been pointed out to me that in
general, B5 messages outnumber the ST messages here on CIS by a factor
of 5-to-1 on most days, and in some cases, as you noted, almost 10-to-1
(the 45 for DS9 and the 451 for B5 in the same period).

       I think it's in part because, once the episode is over, that's
when the fun *really* starts as folks get into the debates and
discussions of what the episode dealt with, the quesions -- plot, moral
and ethical -- raised in the episode, the thematic and historical
elements, and so on.  The show doesn't operate in a vacuum (though the
B5 station obviously does), and it's the threads that reach into other
areas that provoke discussion.

       Which is a Very Good Thing from where I sit.

                                                                  jms
