<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Are you assembling a mailing list from people who write the PO
&gt; box now?

       There's a mailing list being put together, yes, but what'll
count is when the actual checks arrive, and we haven't released the
figure yet.  BTW, we also plan to offer fan club members a 10% discount
on all B5 merchandise produced by the club.

                                                                  jms
