<H2>Question re:First Ones</H2>
<h3>Date: 12-Mar-96 23:50:46</h3>
<pre> Andrew Diseker &lt;70714.105@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Now, the question is: Just because the "First Ones," Vorlons, and
&gt; Shadows are old races, does age necessarily lead to maturity, or
&gt; does a race only last to become an old one by becoming mature?

       A first one is a first one because...well, they're first.  But
yes, the characters are growing.  Growth and change are at the center
of the show.

                                                                  jms
