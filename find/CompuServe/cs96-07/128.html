<pre> Paul Owen &lt;100331.2357@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Since its own weapon seemed to be pretty devastating why did we
&gt; not see it attack a Shadow vessel directly ?

       I think we just didn't see those shots; it was used in the
attack. And thanks.

                                                                  jms
