<pre> Margaret Rainey &lt;100445.742@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; If the Shadows are already on-station, and can blow away Kosh (of
&gt; all people), why don't they just rub out Sheridan, Delenn, et al,
&gt; in a similar manner, and solve their "problems" at a stroke? why
&gt; do I feel I must be over-simplifying....?

       A good question, which we'll answer in the last episode of this
season.

                                                                  jms
