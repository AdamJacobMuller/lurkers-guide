<pre> Rebecca Eschliman &lt;76072.2345@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Now that the Emmy nominations have been announced, and the
&gt; inevitable reactions from the netted are battering at you, I
&gt; would ask, "What award currently given to television would mean
&gt; the most to you?" Is there a particular award that you would find
&gt; most gratifying to receive?

"Is there a particular award that you would find most gratifying to
receive?"

Speaking as a long-term fan...the Hugo.
