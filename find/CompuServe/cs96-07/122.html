<H2>B5 FAN CLUB INFO!</H2>
<h3>Date: 29 Jul 1996 12:47:36 -0700</h3>
<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Why should Joe be soliciting members when he hasn't taken care of
&gt; the ones who sent in money months ago? What guarantee do new
&gt; applicants have that they won't be left in the lurch?

       For starters, I didn't resolicit anyone, the fan club message
gets popped up by the system.  Second, new applicants have less of a
chance of getting left in the lurch than the folks who dived in at the
beginning when we were still putting all the pieces into position.

       If you have *any* reservations, we will happily refund your
money. Or you can give it a bit of time; we can't know who hasn't
gotten their stuff until we hear from them, and/or the post office
sends back the material, which has begun to happen.  We're dealing with
it as fast as possible.

                                                                  jms
