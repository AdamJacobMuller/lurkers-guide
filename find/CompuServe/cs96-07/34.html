<pre> Troy Starr &lt;74752.3172@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; That got me thinking: If you had the choice, how would you have
&gt; prefered the show to be created and distributed? Would you prefer
&gt; independant distribution (such as PTEN), a cable network (TNT),
&gt; or a broadcast network? the market penetration of a prime time
&gt; broadcast network slot?

      It'd be either a guarantee from a cable network -- which would
let us do a lot more in terms of language and hard storylines -- or
syndication. This show wouldn't have lasted long on the networks, which
invariably tend to interfere creatively, and only give short orders to
start.  This is a very eccentric show....

                                                                  jms
