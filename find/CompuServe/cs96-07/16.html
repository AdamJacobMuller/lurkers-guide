<pre>{original post had no questions}

      ANY B5 videos of any sort being sold at conventions are bootlegs
and illegal.  They are crummy quality, and copyright infringement.  We
have been and will continue to prosecute anyone we find doing this. 
And I do mean prosecute.  Serious fines are the order of the day.  For
a second offense, we go for criminal penalties.

                                                                  jms
