<H2>Centari Background</H2>

<pre> Will Caraway &lt;73671.2434@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; 1) What was the Centari's part in the last Shadow War?
&gt; 2) How large was the Centari Empire at its peak?
&gt; 3) What started the downfall of the Centari?
&gt; 4) What role, if any, did the loss of Narn play in that downfall?
&gt; 5) How was the Eye lost originally?

      In short form, since this would take forever otherwise...they
were a fairly large empire at one time, but in areas which didn't
really connect with what was going on with the last shadow war.  They
were more or less out of it. The downfall of the republic was mainly
entropy, it's nearly impossible to maintain control of an empire
covering light years (or even thousands of miles, as the early British
Empire discovered, among others), and in that process, the Narn were
basically the final insult.

                                                                  jms
