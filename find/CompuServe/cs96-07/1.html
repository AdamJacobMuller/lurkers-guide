<pre> Bill MacIntosh &lt;70275.1372@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is there a email address to inquire to the status of my
&gt; membership?

      They're going out in batches; anyone who hasn't received one
within the next week or two, let me know.  Somebody started sending
them out bulk mail; they'll go out henceforth either 1st or 2nd class
mail.

                                                                  jms
