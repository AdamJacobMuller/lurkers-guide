       I think it'd be hard to just drop in Garibaldi's attitudes
about Valen without it having something to do with an episode; if it
doesn't move that particualr episode along, it shouldn't be there.  So
that sort of thing is tough to pull off, making the show more
unfriendly to new viewers.

                                                                  jms
