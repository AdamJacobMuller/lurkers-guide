<pre> Neville White &lt;101352.1023@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; presumably Adira was actually poisoned by Mordens cronies, since
&gt; he was looking for a way to hurt Londo, and we saw him finding
&gt; out information about her? I don't remember seeing any rangers in
&gt; this episode - where did he come in? Will we ever find out why
&gt; Kosh allowed himself to be "poisoned" in the pilot episode now? 
&gt; What was the flash of light running across B5 when Kosh died? Does
&gt; Delenn know what the shadows are after (considering the war from
&gt; a 1000 years ago, I would have thought that the star faring
&gt; Minbari would have had pretty good records)? Will you tell us?
&gt; What happens to the information Kosh recorded about Talia back in
&gt; year1?

Thanks...to your questions:

"1. presumably Adira was actually poisoned by Mordens cronies, since
he was looking for a way to hurt Londo, and we saw him finding out
information about her?"

Correct.

"2. In the final credits, a ranger is mentioned. I don't remember
seeing any rangers in this episode - where did he come in?"

His scene was snipped for time, it was a small one, didn't add much to
the story, but you have to keep those credits in under SAG rules.

"3. Will we ever find out why Kosh allowed himself to be "poisoned" in
the pilot episode now?"

You're assuming he allowed it.

"4. What was the flash of light running across B5 when Kosh died?"

A non-localized phenomenon.

"5. Early on, when Sheriden was talking to Delenn, he wants to know
"what the Shadows are really after". Delenn looks like she is
resolutely not saying anything and hoping that the conversation moves
on before Sheriden presses for an answer... which it does. Does Delenn
know what the shadows are after (considering the war from a 1000 years
ago, I would have thought that the star faring Minbari would have had
pretty good records)?"

They do, and she does, and she's making a few mistakes that may come
back to haunt her in the not too distant future.

"6. Will you tell us? (answer = cryptic "YES" no doubt!)"

In the fullness of time.
