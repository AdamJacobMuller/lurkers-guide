<pre> O. C. Alexander &lt;72623.3472@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Indirectly unrelated to this, wouldn't intimate contact make it
&gt; more difficult for Susan to hide any psi tendencies from Talia? 
&gt; Also indirectly unrelated, given the previous statements by Talia
&gt; about the intensity of mutual telepath love, do telepaths in
&gt; general view intimacy with non-telepaths as a lesser experience,
&gt; and so typically avoid "normals" as lovers?

      Well, a telepath can also hold it back and avoid dipping any
further into someone's mind, if not permitted or asked not to do so.

                                                                  jms
