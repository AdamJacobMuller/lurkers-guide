      I'm also the executive producer, I basically *make* the show,
overseeing every aspect of production, hiring directors, actors,
supervising sets, costumes, efx, you name it.

      It takes 7 days to film an episode.  My favorite is probably
"Shadow Dancing," which you haven't seen yet, mainly because I haven't
been able to poke any holes in it yet.  It's a good ep.

                                                                  jms
