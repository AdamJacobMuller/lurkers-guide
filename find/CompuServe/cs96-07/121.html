<H2>B5 FAN CLUB INFO!</H2>
<h3>Date: 29 Jul 1996 12:39:07 -0700</h3>
<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Nothing personal, Joe, but why are you soliciting membership in a
&gt; "fan club" when most of us who applied for membership and sent
&gt; money months ago haven't received anything?

       No, it's not vapor.  Many people *have* received their stuff. 
So it's there, and it's working, but there have been some glitches in
the post office side that blindsided us.  A "vapor club" is one where
you sign up and get nothing, because nothing's made or delivered.  Many
people here and elsewhere *have* received their full packets, and
newsletters, and the posters are going out shortly, now that WB has
*finally* approved the design, which took longer than it should have.

       If you haven't received the material, send email to
jplb5@aol.com and let him know.

                                                                  jms
