<pre> William H. DiPaola &lt;76521.1751@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Why did they(the studio) even bother in the first place without
&gt; serious revisions having at least been done first??!! Have people
&gt; become this lame in mentality, this stupid??????? Where has common
&gt; sense gone by en large, and have people learned to just 'shut
&gt; their brains off' when they go to a theater?

      Thanks.  I saw ID4 this week, and on one level, could enjoy it
for the technical expertise (I think they ate our lunch in some visual
areas, and now somebody else is doing Big Fleet stuff, so we have to
work to stay ahead of the curve again).  But story wise, yeah, there
was some massively dopey stuff in there.

                                                                  jms
