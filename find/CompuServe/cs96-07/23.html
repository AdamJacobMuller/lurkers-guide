<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; What should we do, next time?

       Best to get their card and let me know the details; we'll take
it from there.

       There've been enough inquiries on this that I'm thinking maybe
I ought to make some kind of general policy statement for folks to
have.  I'll try to get to it soonish.

                                                                  jms
