<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;70530.2521@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I'm curious: What exactly did Marcus/Franklin tell Delenn about
&gt; David in "A Late Delivery from Avalon" before she went in to
&gt; recover the sword? Did they tell her who he was and what he did?
&gt; Did they tell her what "role" the wanted her to play?
&gt; Did they tell her to get the sword?

      She was told the whole background...including who David really
was. She was in a way taking the pain from someone who had attacked the
very ship she and the other Grey council members had been aboard.

                                                                  jms
