<pre> Philip Hornsey &lt;74053.2101@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; In what context did Torme's name come up, if I may be so bold as
&gt; to ask?

      No, everything I've heard concurs with your assessment. 
Basically, we have a lot of mutual friends in common, and the name just
came up in conversation.

                                                                  jms
