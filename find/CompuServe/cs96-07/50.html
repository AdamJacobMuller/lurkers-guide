<pre> Art W. Sullivan &lt;104630.1315@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Contrary to other peoples worries, do you feel, that it will be
&gt; easier getting B5 renewed for year 5, than it was for year 4? Now
&gt; that WB has shelled out the money for 4 years of B5, even if
&gt; rating dropped slightly ( not that they will ), wouldn't it be
&gt; better to complete year 5 and try for a greater syndication price
&gt; based on a 5 year complete series than a partially completed 4
&gt; year run?

      It's a sensible position, yes.  Let us hope they can be
reasonable.

                                                                  jms
