<pre> colin heaps &lt;100622.3610@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; It's okay to kill the Narns , after all, it isn't as if they were
&gt; another sentient species is it? Finally, Claudia, (why can't she
&gt; come to the Wolf convention - please, pretty please - you'd hate
&gt; to see a grown man begwouldn't you?

      That's all very encouraging, thanks.  Yeah, it's kind of a fun
episode, all soft and fuzzy on the outside, with REAL big teeth on the
inside.  I like that kind of episode a lot.  It's wonderfully
subversive.

                                                                  jms
