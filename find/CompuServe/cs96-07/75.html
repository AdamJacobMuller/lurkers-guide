<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;70530.2521@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; How is it done, or is it some combination of these things that
&gt; determine a Minbari's caste?

      In "Legacies" the question of caste heritage had more to do with
how your death is handled than what you're determined to be in life.

                                                                  jms
