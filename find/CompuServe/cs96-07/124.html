<pre> Neville White &lt;101352.1023@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Another thought that occurred to me just now - and I haven't been
&gt; back to the video to check it up, but in Dust to Dust didn't Kosh
&gt; appear in G'Kars dream as *his* father, too?

       Yes, by all means, I can't exactly lay claim to a patriarchal
system, after all.  And that's what Kosh tends to play into, the whole
father aspect, though others might take the other approach in this.

                                                                  jms
