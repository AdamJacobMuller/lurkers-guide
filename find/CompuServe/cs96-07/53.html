<pre> Michael Beemer &lt;71551.1670@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Are they still "speaking Minbari" with the English presented for
&gt; our benefit, a la "Red October"?

      No, he slid into Minbari at that point to try and conceal what
was being said from the others on the bridge.

                                                                  jms
