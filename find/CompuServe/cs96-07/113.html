<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; What exactly is a "demo reel"?
&gt; Is it more like a pilot episode complete with actors or more like
&gt; a series of highlight clips? I know the sequel is in the B5
&gt; universe but time-wise would it be before, after or during the
&gt; current timeline? Does the TNT deal have to do with the broadcast
&gt; of B5 reruns?

      No, the TNT situation involves something else, though it relates
to B5. More on this when things are settled.

                                                                  jms
