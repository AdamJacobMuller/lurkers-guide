<pre> Paul Owen &lt;100331.2357@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I've just watched Ship of Tears, and looking at the new War Room,
&gt; I wondered how much the ordinary technical staff know about the
&gt; Shadows?, are they a selected and trusted few or are all B5 (ex
&gt; Earthforce) personnel now pretty much aware of what's going on ? 
&gt; PS who do the flying saucers belong to???

      Everyone now pretty much knows what's going on.  It's out in the
open now.

                                                                  jms
