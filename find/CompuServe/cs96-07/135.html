<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; What significance was the fact that one of the Vorlon ships was
&gt; red instead of the usual green/yellow ? Is it a prototype ?

       Thanks.  The different color just goes to show some measure of
individuality in design, and there are some hierarchies implied here.

                                                                  jms
