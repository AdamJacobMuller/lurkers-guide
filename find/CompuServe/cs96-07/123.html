<H2>B5 FAN CLUB INFO!</H2>
<h3>Date: 29 Jul 1996 12:47:37 -0700</h3>
<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Nothing personal, Joe, but why are you soliciting membership in a
&gt; "fan club" when most of us who applied for membership and sent
&gt; money months ago haven't received anything?

       PS...I just went down the hall to ask Jim Lockett about what
the status of things was, and there was a huge pile of newsletters and
packets on his desk ready to go out.  I asked about yours in
particular, and he had it right there, about ten down in the "to-mail"
pile.  So you should have the stuff shortly.

                                                                  jms
