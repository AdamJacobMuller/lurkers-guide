<pre> Don Crossman &lt;75147.175@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Question: I sent a query (from my AOL acct); Is he acknowledging
&gt; msgs or not?

      Jim's gotten a lot of email on this, but that's good, it lets us
track down where the problems are.  But it may take him a while to
acknowledge it all, given that.

                                                                  jms
