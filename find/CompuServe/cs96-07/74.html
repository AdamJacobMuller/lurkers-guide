<pre> Vivien Loveday &lt;100705.2440@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; protect what?!
&gt; Is this going to be explained in Shadow Dancing?
&gt; have the shadows reopened the facility that you mentioned in
&gt; Messages From Earth and the comics? Is this Mars link important?

      Kill telepaths to protect the Machine from them.

                                                                  jms
