      No, I don't think so, because that plunges you too deeply into
the mire of situational morality or situational ethics.  Granted,
there's always a certain element of situational judgment in these
things ("It's wrong to kill. The martians are about to flatten the
country.  KILL 'EM.")  But the decision making process should, ideally,
be on what seems the *right* thing to do rather than the *convenient*
thing to do.

                                                                  jms
