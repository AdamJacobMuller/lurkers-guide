<pre> S.G. Menzel &lt;100537.1517@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Any idea how much longer?
&gt; Could you post a message here, once the webpage is up and
&gt; running?

      Thanks, and as soon as WB gets us the approvals, we'll be sure
to announce the web page just about everydamnwhere.

                                                                  jms
