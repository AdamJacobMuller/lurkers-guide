<pre> Al Lipscomb &lt;75204.2225@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; A race of critters who started out in hyperspace?
&gt; Who could have let them out?

      No, they didn't exactly start out in hyperspace, but they were
among the first to get into it, and they know a lot of tricks in and
out and around it.

                                                                  jms
