<pre> Hero Games (Sue) &lt;75162.372@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Did I miss something?
&gt; Was anything ever actually confirmed between the two of them or
&gt; was it merely hinted at as being a possibility?

      They weren't shown in separate beds.  We saw Talia reaching over
to the empty space in the bed where Ivanova had been, and finding her
gone.

                                                                  jms
