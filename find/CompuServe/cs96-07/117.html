<pre> AsstOp Mike Willmoth &lt;76170.1037@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Why the difference?

       Because putting Ambassador at the start of each name would look
odd after a while, and many people wouldn't get to the second name
before it scrolled off; because Delenn and G'Kar only have the one
name, and to break it for Londo...well, what the heck.  So the Centauri
get screwed for a change, it's about time.

                                                                  jms
