<pre> Rebecca Eschliman &lt;76072.2345@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; May one assume that, given these new potential offers, that you
&gt; might be willing to postpone your retirement from television for
&gt; a few years (please, please, PLEASE..)?

       We will see what we will see....

                                                                  jms
