      I'd actually offer that we're not a moral show at all, but
rather an ethical show.  We don't generally tell people what to think,
or which road they have to take.  Rather, we raise ethical issues for
the purpose of provoking discussion so people can define their stands
for themselves.

                                                                  jms
