<pre> SysOp Dupa T Parrot &lt;70040.104@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; So how did you manage that?
&gt; Didja throw teddy bears at him?

      At Chicago, the assumption was still that the UK wouldn't be
getting the final 5 until the US did.  But since now they'll be getting
new (to the US) episodes starting in August, keeping the title quiet
now seems kind of a moot issue.

                                                                  jms
