<pre> Mark Sloan &lt;100407.3462@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Did you ever consider regularly putting in clips from previous
&gt; episodes at the start of each programme, in the same manner as,
&gt; say, LA Law, another programme with multi-episode storylines?

      The problem with putting in clips from previous episodes is that
we only have about 42-43 minutes to tell our story.  If we put in 30
seconds or 1 minute of clips from last week, that leaves us with 1 less
minute to tell our story this week, and in this show, we need every
second we can get.

                                                                  jms
