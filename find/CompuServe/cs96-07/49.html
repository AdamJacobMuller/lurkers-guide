      Thanks.  I know the feeling; I get the same reaction when I read
Jonathan Carroll's books.  It's the nearest thing I've seen in writing
to close-up magic, it's *right there* in your face, and you can't see
how he's doing it.  If the stuff in I&amp;E came even close to that, then
I'm happy.

                                                                  jms
