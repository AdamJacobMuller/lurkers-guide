      Usually I carry it around in my head; if I need to quote
verbatim from a prior episode, for a flashback or the like, then I tend
to drag out the script and read it; it's easier than fast-forwarding
through videotape.

      I do tend to rewatch episodes as they're aired in reruns, making
sure nothing untoward happens to them.

                                                                  jms
