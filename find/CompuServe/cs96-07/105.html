<pre> Stephen Chatwood &lt;100522.1020@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Then at the end of WWE we see Sinclair flanked by a couple of
&gt; Vorlons, about 900 years before Babylon5 existed?? Any comments?

      Bear in mind that there have been lots of folks named Sinclair
in the last 900 years; that we don't know how much Valen told anyone
about his prior life; that the Minbari had had little to no direct
contact with the Vorlons in well over a hundred years and likely would
not have told them what they found at the Battle of the Line until such
time as personal contact had been made again, which only happened at
Kosh's arrival...and there wasn't exactly time to make a report after
he rolled into B5 for the first time.

                                                                  jms
