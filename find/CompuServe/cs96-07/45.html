<H2>Minbari &amp; League Ques.</H2>
<h3>Date: 15 Jul 1996 22:56:24 -0700</h3>
<pre> Richard Wakefield &lt;100534.504@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; When was the Earth-Minbari war ?
&gt; And it was the DSEV Amundsen that fired, was it not ?
&gt; How many (roughly) Alien races are in the League Of Non-Aligned
&gt; Worlds ? Are there just the ones in the B5 Counsel ?
&gt; Or are there a few more ?

      The Earth/Minbari war ended in 2247, and there were several
ships in the initial contact convoy, the Amundsen and the Prometheus.

      The membership in the League varies widely and frequently, so a
good count is difficult.

                                                                  jms
