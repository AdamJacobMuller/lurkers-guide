<pre> SysOp Dupa T Parrot &lt;70040.104@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Do you have any idea how often you've brought tears to our eyes
&gt; this season? Particularly the tears shed over an animatronic
&gt; actor?

       And that's good.  Too much of TV is just the plot/action stuff,
not much emotional content.  For me, drama done well should make you
feel something.  That's vitally important to me.

                                                                  jms
