      It is, not to put too fine a point on it...EXTREMELY important
to see "Shadow Dancing."  If they choose to cut the nasty bits that's
one thing, it won't affect what You Need To See, but to not run it at
all would be a disaster of substantial dimensions.  Still, I imagine
they'll run it; the nasty bits can be excised pretty well, if
necessary, I should think.

                                                                  jms
