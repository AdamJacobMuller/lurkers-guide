<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Did you mean to say you "could" answer every question "if" you
&gt; chose, UNLESS you were specifically prohibited by WB from doing
&gt; so? So you just basically feel that reveling his age would be a
&gt; major spoiler of some kind?

      Well, logically, you could backtrack from there to figure out
exactly when Sheridan and Delenn...er...get together.  I'd rather let
that come along at its own pace.
