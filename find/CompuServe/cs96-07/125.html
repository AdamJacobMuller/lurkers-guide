<H2>Olympics in 2260?</H2>
<h3>Date: 30 Jul 1996 14:19:09 -0700</h3>
<pre> Eric Rochkind &lt;70671.302@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Since we have not yet seen or heard the Olympics mentioned in the
&gt; third season of "Babylon 5" (Granted, this could be in one of
&gt; those episodes we haven't seen yet) are the olympics still being
&gt; celebrated in the 23rd century? If not, why not?
&gt; Any ideas on this subject?

       My gut instinct would be that the Olympics would still be
almost exclusively an Earth/human thing, we have to keep some things to
ourselves, as part of our unique heritage.  And they're probably still
going on.

                                                                  jms
