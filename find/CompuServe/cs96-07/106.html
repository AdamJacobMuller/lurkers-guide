<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Are there serious, concrete plans for this "side story"?

      All I can say for now is that WB has asked us to make a
presentation to them on a possible sequel; this has been done.  They've
now asked us to go to the next step of making a demo reel.  In
addition, there's some very exciting stuff going on with TNT that I
can't talk about yet, but hope to be able to do so soon.

                                                                  jms
