      Re: apologies...unnecessary.  We learn by our mistakes, and move
on. The incident is forgotten, gone.  We move on.

      To your questions...there's always been a side-story that could
go off after the 5 years in the B5 universe, but it wouldn't be B5.  No
reference books planned for now, or anything filmic currently on the
boards.

                                                                  jms
