<pre> Jonathan Hoopingarn &lt;73172.1065@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is 1G maintained at the interior surface or the last level (Down
&gt; Below?) just inside the skin? How many levels are there between
&gt; the outer hull and the inner surface (I'm trying to figure the
&gt; change in "gravity" from level to level)? What's the radius of the
&gt; main cylinder? By the way, had you read Gerard K O'Neill's work on
&gt; space habitats?

       I don't have the specs onhand, but basically you've got a
smidge under 1g in the inner levels, working out until you've got a
smidge over 1g in the areas closest to the hull.  This helps with alien
requirements in living quarters in those areas.

                                                                  jms
