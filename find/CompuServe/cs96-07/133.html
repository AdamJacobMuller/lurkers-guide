<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; First of all why does she get into the suit?
&gt; What the heck is that about?
&gt; Also, why wouldn't she try and wake Sheridan to see if he was OK?

       When Delenn takes off her stabalizer and puts it on Sheridan,
taking on his suit for whatever small protection it might offer, at
that point he stabalized and she became lost/unstuck in time.  So it
was she who appeared in the last sequence there.  She took the risk to
ensure saving Sheridan.

                                                                  jms
