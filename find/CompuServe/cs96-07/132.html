<pre> Chris Croughton (UK) &lt;100014.3217@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; To you, maybe, but there are dozens (hundreds?
&gt; How about all the blues singers who couldn't recognise a note of
&gt; written music but wrote those superb songs? Has it been shown yet?

       No, the songs are in "Walkabout," which is the next episode up
after "War Without End."

                                                                  jms
