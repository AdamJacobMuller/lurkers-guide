<pre> Helene Northway &lt;72370.1026@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Any word for those of us who sent checks/form in in April and
&gt; haven't received anything yet????

       There've been some problems with the post office; send a note
to jplb5@aol.com to let him know your situation.

                                                                  jms
