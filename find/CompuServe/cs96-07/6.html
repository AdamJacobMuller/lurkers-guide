<pre> Martin Shaw &lt;101642.505@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; What is the current status on this?

      Okay, we've got a reading on this.  All overseas/foreign Fan
Club memberships will be handled using Air Mail instead of ground, for
the same price.  We'll just eat the difference.  So memberships from
the UK and elsewhere can come on in now.

                                                                  jms
