<pre> Shane S. Shellenbarger &lt;104305.3404@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; BTW, standing and pacing for ninty minutes must be tiring,
&gt; couldn't they get you a bar stool?

      There were chairs there, but I would've been low-eye level, and
given that there were SO many folks so FAR in the back, all you
would've seen from that distance would've been the table and a little
bump for a head.  So I stayed on my feet.  Besides, a moving target is
harder to hit....

                                                                  jms
