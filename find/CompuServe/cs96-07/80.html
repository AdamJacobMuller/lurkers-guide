<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; How come we've never seen one on B5?
&gt; Hasn't Dicovery done one, or did we manage to miss it?
&gt; With Chris Franke doing the music for that show, can't you
&gt; contact the producers and get into their lineup? Or is this
&gt; another example of WB a**h***ishness?

       Movie Magic wanted to do an hour on B5, but it was nixed by WB;
we hope to do one eventually, though.

                                                                  jms
