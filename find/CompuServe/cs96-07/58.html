<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; I can see why you can't answer questions #2 &amp; #3, but how could
&gt; the age of Delenn and Sheridan's child spoil a plot? Would it make
&gt; a difference if he was 5 or 15 at the time?

       It's not that I *can't* answer the question, I simply choose
not to. There is no requirement here that I HAVE to answer every single
question unless I'm specifically prohibited for some reason.  Some
things I just prefer to hold back until a later time.  You may not know
the reasons, but I do.

                                                                  jms
