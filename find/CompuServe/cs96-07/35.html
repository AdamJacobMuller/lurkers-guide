<pre> Vlobb &lt;101523.507@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Seriously for a second...are you going to be writing the episodes
&gt; for Season 4 under the assumption that there shall be a Season 5
&gt; at the moment? Oh, and if you are writing them assuming that there
&gt; will be an S5, do you have a Master Plan to bring us the end of
&gt; the story should Warners fail us???

        I'll have more on this once I've worked it out.

                                                                  jms
