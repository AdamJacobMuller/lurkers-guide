<pre> Andrew Bradbury &lt;100777.747@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Would I put something like "Copyright Time-Warner 1996", (or am I
&gt; getting totally confused?), or "Babylon 5 is a trademark of {x}"? 
&gt; Finally, as the picture is entirely my own work, am I entitled to
&gt; put my own copyright on the picture (making sure I acknowledge
&gt; the previous trademarks/copyrights)?

      The copyright is still owned by PTEN, regardless of the future.

                                                                  jms
