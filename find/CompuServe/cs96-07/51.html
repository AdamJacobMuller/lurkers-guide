<pre> Richard Wakefield &lt;100534.504@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; How do you get around and reply too so many messages ?
&gt; All I would like to know is are *all* the races, including
&gt; Vorlons and Shadows between 2-4 days hyperspace from B5 ? We know
&gt; Earth is 3 days, Centauri Prime is 4 days.Someone said the Vorlon
&gt; Homeword was 4 days, and Narn 2 days...can you confirm this ? Are
&gt; the shadows far away, just a couple of days ?

      The majority of races are within that range because that's as
far as they've gone in putting in navigational beacons, without which
traveling in hyperspace can be extremely dangerous.  You sort of inch
your way outwards.

      And thanks...it is a massive task, moreso than most folks will
ever know, or should ever know...but it's worth it in the end.

                                                                  jms
