<pre> William H. DiPaola &lt;76521.1751@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Your show in an issue where Trek was also focused on??!!

       I stay off the road for the good of the commonweal; it's not
something I feel is negotiable, just personally.  It's unquestionably a
pain in the butt.

                                                                  jms
