<pre>{original post had no questions}

      The intro movie, "A Call to Arms," is still slated for January
3rd; the series initiall was going to go in January, then they moved it
to June 2nd to make room for the NBA playoffs, and now that it looks
like the playoffs may not happen, I'm hearing March/April.

                                                                  jms
