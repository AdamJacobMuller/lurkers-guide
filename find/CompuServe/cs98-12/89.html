      Understand: I get several HUNDRED messages a day.  Every day. 
Day in and day out.  Public and private.  I cannot reply to all of
them, and there is no requirement that I must reply to each of them. 
If I feel it requires a response, I do so; if not, I don't. 
Complaining about it to the forum is not the appropriate response.

                                                                  jms
