<pre> Andy Ihnatko &lt;72511.204@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; No more, for they made the same frustrated laments: "But what
&gt; about Londo and G'Kar? Did Garibaldi...?
&gt; And will David...?"
&gt; (aside: Why is it that all of the shows in this last category
&gt; seem to have one-word titles and be about former standup comics?

      Thanks...and you're right on all counts.  Additionally, you have
to really decide *Who is the story about?*  You can really only track a
couple of characters to the end...here we tracked a number there or
nearly there. This story is a history -- told from a future perspective
 -- about the events of the Babylon station, and those who passed
through it, during a specific period in its history.

                                                                  jms
