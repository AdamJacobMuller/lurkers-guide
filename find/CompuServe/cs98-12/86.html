<pre> Bruce Scandariato &lt;72571.1722@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Since SIL was filmed in season 4, was there anything that you
&gt; would have changed had you known ahead of time that B5 was
&gt; renewed for season 5 with respect to Ivanova and Lochley and
&gt; others?

      I had the option to change stuff if I'd been so inclined...but
felt it was right as it was.

                                                                  jms
