<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; BTW, did SiL remain completely untouched in the can during the
&gt; fifth year?

      Yeah...everybody figured the pak'ma'ra were just a waste...which
is why this seemed so right.

      And yes again...SiL was untouched since I finished my producer's
edit at the end of year 4.  No need.

                                                                  jms
