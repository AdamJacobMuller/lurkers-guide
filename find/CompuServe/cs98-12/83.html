<H2>Hugo?</H2>
<h3>Date: 30 Nov 1998 12:29:00 -0700</h3>
<pre> George Gillburg/CA &lt;73137.1733@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Speaking of which, in the scene where General Ivanova (and thanks
&gt; for getting her back for this last episode) receives here
&gt; summons, was that a Hugo award on her desk?

      Yeah, that was our first Hugo...just sorta slipped it in with
Ivanova's other awards.  It was kind of a nod back to our fans...and I
think the first time that a Hugo has been shown on-screen in a series
that has *won* a Hugo.

                                                                  jms
