<pre> Mark McGehee &lt;75720.2420@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; However, I receieved a very "flip" response from somebody named
&gt; Michael?????

      It wasn't me.

      And I didn't need to have this copied to me in email because you
can't read an address line to see who sent you mail.

      And it's arrogant.  Not arragont.

                                                                  jms
