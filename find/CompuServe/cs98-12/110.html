<pre> Joseph Schierer &lt;76326.3124@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; So, now that it is done - just how big a feeling of satisfaction
&gt; did it give you? with the benefit of hindsite, would you do it all
&gt; over again?

      It's an immense satisfaction to get it all done, and out the
door, when nobody thought it could be done.  Would I do it again?  I
don't know...I had no idea how hard this would be when I got into it. 
The only way it got done was that I didn't know it was impossible at
the time.  I think I would, though.

                                                                  jms
