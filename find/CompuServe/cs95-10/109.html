<pre>     In Zone, I tried as much as possible mainly to stick to the Serling
influence in my stories; that I felt was my primary obligation.

     "Gethsemane" isn't a horror-type story at all, though it does have a
very TZish feeling, so it doesn't owe to any of those.  Best to just let you
see it when it airs.

                                                                       jms
