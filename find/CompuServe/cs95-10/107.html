<pre>     I saw your prior note, and I'd have to say that probably most of the
items you cite as similarities in approach have to do with just about any
space-borne science fiction.  Many colony worlds, varying tech levels,
that's fairly generic.

     Definitely agree about the differences, though.

                                                                       jms
