<pre>     Re: "Comes the Inquisitor" (and I'm not sure whether to address this to
you or Rae, not quite having caught the top of this)...when I wrote that
episode, I figured it'd get some strong reactions.  What I did not expect
was the comment, which I've now received from a number of women -- women who
sat stoically through "Believers" and "Confessions and Lamentations" -- that
they were in tears over "Inquisitor."

     So I'd be curious to know what caused that reaction.  I think I may
have subconsciously tapped something there -- the search for identity at its
most emotional core, or just that it's Delenn -- and I'm trying to get a
better sense of what that is.

                                                                       jms
