<pre>&lt;What's holding Londo to the deck? Velcro(tm)? Suction cups? The 
w\e\i\g\h\t\ mass of his sins? Something else?&gt;

     Some races, like the Centauri and the Minbari, use drive systems built 
to varying degrees on magnetic and gravitational forces; 
some of them don't so much go to a planet as create a situation where they 
are drawn toward it. 
One of the side effects of this is a field allowing for artificial gravity. 
Earth doesn't have this level of technology, however.

                                                                       jms
