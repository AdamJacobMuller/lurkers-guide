<pre>     Absolutely not.  I don't think the audience is facionalized, really; I
think there's *plenty* of room for SF, but it has to be SF *done well*.

     See, that's the difference in how execs think (if I can use that term);
if a cop show dies, they say, "Well, that one show didn't work."  If an SF
series dies, they say, "There's no market for SF in television."

     I think that the audience can handle lots of SF, if it's quality.

     BTW, though I normally don't have a chance to catch the ST shows, with
rare exceptions, I did manage to catch tonight's Voyager...and I have to say
that this was probably the best I've seen to date.  The dialogue was crisp
and funny and insightful, the story worked (even though the plot per se was
nothing to write home about), the bits played...I quite enjoyed it.  I'd
love to see them do more of this kind of thing.

                                                                       jms
