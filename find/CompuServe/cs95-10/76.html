<pre>     One solution to this, though, is what made this last episode of ST:V so
enjoyable.  Usually, when you watch a ST show, you get gang writing credits;
it goes through the hopper and gets filtered through so many other writers
that it loses its flavor.  Not to say they're not good writers, this is the
case on ANY show, on ANY script; the more people who stick their snouts into
a script, however individually talented, the overall quality of the script
diminishes, gets watered down.

     The episode this past Monday had just one name on it, and while I'm
sure there was some tinkering here and there, it wasn't enough for anyone to
take credit, which means the lion's share of the episode was written by this
single writer...and that made all the difference in the world.  The dialogue
was crisp and funny, the "voice" of the show was consistent throughout, it
moved well...it worked.

     The ST model is to work over scripts in-house to within an inch of
their lives...but frankly, sometimes it's better to leave the darned thing
alone.  This was a good example of that.  (I don't recall the writer's name
offhand, but if they're smart, they'll put him or her on staff asap.)

                                                                       jms
