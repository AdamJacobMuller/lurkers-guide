<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: October 19, 1995 1:09:01 PM</h3>
<pre>&lt;Would you have still attempted something as complex as Babylon 5 if VCRs 
were not as common as they are now?  
Say, ten years ago? Is it something you took into consideration at all?&gt;

     The story is the story, regardless of the medium some might use to 
record them at home.

                                                                       jms
