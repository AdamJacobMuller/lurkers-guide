<pre>&lt;Didn't Garibaldi see Talia in comic #8?  Why didn't he recognize her later?&gt;

     Nope, he was looking at the process overall; he never saw Talia.  The
one shot of her is the omniscient POV, not his.  (And even if he had seen
her, it would've been only a glimpse of a blonde woman, no name that he
could see, and after so many years, given that her condition wasn't great at
the time, he wouldn't necessarily recognize her in any event.)  But it's a
moot point; the comic never indicated that he saw her.

                                                                       jms
