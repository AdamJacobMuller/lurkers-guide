<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: October 07, 1995 9:53:15 PM</h3>
<pre>     Yes, the B5 magazine is coming out from Sendai in the next month or so.
I've read the copy for the first issue, and what I like is that it's not an
obvious puff piece; it asks some tough questions, and doesn't soften the
language or image of the characters on this show behind the scenes.  I told
them, when they got the license, right up front, nothing is taboo, write
about whatever you want.  The first issue, by nature, is more or less an
introduction, with profiles of most of our core cast, but my guess is that
more in-depth pieces will be coming in subsequent issues.

     We finally got the paperwork on the B5 fan club, and have to make some
minor adjustments, but should have the contracts revised and signed within
the next week or so.  Shortly after that, we'll have an AOL page, and not
long thereafter a web page for signups; we'll also try and integrate those
fan clubs already out there as official branches, should they so desire.

                                                               jms
