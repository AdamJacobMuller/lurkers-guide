<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: October 18, 1995 2:06:00 AM</h3>
<pre>     What many folks forget is that Serling's story were as often about
redemption as about damnation; about hope as often as about horror.  That
lesson is forgotten by many horror writers who claim him as influence.

     The Serling influence, for me, is the strength of individual humans to
endure much, sacrifice greatly, yet come out the other end of the struggle
something nobler and stronger.

                                                                       jms
