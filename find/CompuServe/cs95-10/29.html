<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: October 07, 1995 12:36:12 AM</h3>
<pre>     I'd also put "Grail" in my list of least-favorite eps from year one,
along with "Infection" and "War Prayer."

     We're shooting the two-parter as 15 and 16, but airing them as 13 and 14,
in order to accommodate the need to have the same director do both halves.
It's a matter of working around the schedule of directors when they're
available, and that's when Adam's available.

                                                                       jms
