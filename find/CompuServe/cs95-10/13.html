<pre>     I understand your point of view that point of view is no less valid
than any other point of view...and note that the point of view about point
of view offered from this end elicited "I don't necessarily agree with
that," because that point of view is not a point of view which coincides
with your own point of view, thus is viewed by you as a not necessarily
valid criticism, which fundamentally reinforces my original statement, from
my point of view.

                                                                       jms
