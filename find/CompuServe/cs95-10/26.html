<H2> VOYAGER'S BAD TREK		</H2>
<h3>Section: Star Trek<br>Date: October 05, 1995 11:25:18 PM</h3>
<pre>     Speaking of TPTB, here's an interesting angle on the whole Voyager/DS9
dynamic.

     Recently, more and more, the ST execs (people like Berman and Pillar)
have been commenting publicly about the factionalization of the SF TV
marketplace, and how this has diminished the numbers for the ST shows
overall.  Most interestingly, one of them commented in an LA Times article
this past week that a big problem for them is the factionalization *within*
ST...that people may only have time to watch one version of ST that week,
and they're being forced to choose.  And, of course, there are the debates
between the two sides on quality.

     Which dovetails precisely into the rumor running around town that
Paramount is considering giving the axe to DS9 after this season, in order
to force folks who want their ST to watch Voyager...because they have more
money invested right now in Voyager, particularly in start-up, and they have
their hopes for the Paramount network pinned to Voyager as their center.
They don't like the idea of a syndicated show out there causing problems for
the network on which they've spent millions and millions of dollars.  And
DS9's ratings have been steadily on the decrease since the debut.  So the
logic goes: take away DS9, and make those who want Trek go to Voyager as the
sole provider of that.

     Given the sources from whom this has come, I give very high credibility
to the notion that this *is* being discussed; whether or not it will be
implemented, that only time will tell.  If Voyager continues to decrease,
threatening the foundations of Paramount's bid for a network, I'd think the
chances of this happening will continue to rise.

                                                                       jms
