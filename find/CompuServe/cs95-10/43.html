<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: October 07, 1995 9:54:00 PM</h3>
<pre>     Visually, yeah, I'd have to say TFoN is one of our biggest from year
two, and I'm quite fond of it; the only reason that it isn't in my top three
is because while the last half is very intense, it takes a little bit to get
there; I like 'em intense from the first frame on.

     For the growing use of montage/intercutting...it's really just a
process of continuing to learn my craft.  So I try out and experiment with
different techniques.  While I love dialogue, and lots of it, I'm also
coming more and more to appreciate moments where you *only* play the
visuals, and the music, and get out of the way of the Moment.

     At this point, we have the first 5 in various stages of completion; we
deliver 1 and 2 this coming Tuesday; we've finished all the EFX in #3 except
for the placement of a couple of sound effects and the placement of music
cues; we're still getting in EFX for #4, and just finished the producers'
cut on #5.

                                                                       jms
