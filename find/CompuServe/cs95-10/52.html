<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: October 10, 1995 12:49:24 AM</h3>
<pre>     No, "Severed Dreams" is episode #10.

     I think really that "War Prayer" was so thoroughly ruined for me by the
direction, as was "Grail," that I can't see past that aspect.  We spent
hours and hours in the editing room, trying to make those work, and it was a
major league pain in the butt.

                                                                       jms
