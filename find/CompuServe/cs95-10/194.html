<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: October 30, 1995 10:33:10 PM</h3>
<pre>&lt;Have you won any awards for the show yet?  Kosh was spectacular.&gt;

     We've only won one Emmy and a couple of small awards for the series 
(plus another Emmy for the pilot).  We're still working on making people
aware that we're here, and what we're doing.

     Other than that...thanks.

                                                                       jms
