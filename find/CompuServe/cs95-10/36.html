<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: October 07, 1995 12:53:12 AM</h3>
<pre>      As noted elsewhere, there are going to be more B5 comics as one-shots
and miniseries...Tim DeHaas is doing one set during the Earth/Minbari War (I'm
doing a lot of consulting on that one to provide canon background on who was
where, when, doing what), and I've begun a 4-issue mini tentatively entitled
"The Book of the War," which chronicles much of our new Ranger character.

                                                                       jms
