<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: October 26, 1995 2:18:31 PM</h3>
<pre>     In answer to your question (383177)....

     As you've noted, the Powers That Be at Warner Bros. don't think there 
is a market for B5 tapes, from the first season to present.  The *only* way 
that they can ever be released is if the fans themselves take action.  
That is the absolute bottom-line.  Only if the fans speak out will this 
happen. This is not a drill, and I don't pass along this kind of information 
lightly or often, even when requested, as was done here.

     The primary contact, who can make the decision, is Mr. James Cardwell,
Executive Vice-President/General Manager, Warner Bros. Home Video, North
American Division, 3903 W. Olive, Building 154, 3rd Floor, Burbank, CA 91522.

     I do not anticipate posting this elsewhere, to avoid the appearance of 
encouraging a deluge.  The question has come up here repeatedly, and I
answered finally.  If others choose to take this message from CIS and post
it elsewhere, that's certainly their option.

     At this point, since WB has no plans to rerun the first season due to 
concerns that the presence of a different CO might confuse viewers, 
this is about the only way for folks who saw, or missed, the first season to 
catch up on all that went before.  (Obviously when the show is over completely,
 the episodes will go into syndication, but that is, presumably, 3 years 
down the road.)

                                                                       jms
