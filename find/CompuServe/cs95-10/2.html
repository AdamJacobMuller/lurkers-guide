<pre>     No ill will was taken, or is extended.

     Actually, it seems to me, what you're really talking about is not the
show's maturity, but your *familiarity* with the characters, two different
things.  The more you see them, the more backlog of information you have to
appreciate their actions.  Very often, on many series, it's not so much a
question of the actors getting comfortable with their characters as the
*audience* getting comfortable with them.  Many of the same folks who
initially didn't like Sinclair, after they got to know the character, went
back to re-watch the first episodes and found that there's depth they didn't
appreciate there, visible now because they know who the character is.
