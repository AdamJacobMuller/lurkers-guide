<pre>     Some shows just tend to have that as their guiding principle: rewrite
the hell out of it.  Others try as much as possible to leave it alone and
let the voice of the original writer come through.  I tend to fall more into
the latter camp.  In some cases, I revise heavily, but only where I feel
it's absolutely necessary.  Otherwise I leave it alone.  David Gerrold's
script for "Believers," for instance, is about 85% his.  DC Fontana's last
script for us was about 90% hers.  Just tweaks, mainly.

     According to an interview I saw with one of the main ST producers, they
use the "breaking the story" mode, which I've never much liked.  To wit: in
each and every case, they take the story, and gather in a room, and start
scattergunning ideas and arguments and plot points, which one person writes
down on a blackboard, crossing out some items while adding others.  Yeah,
it's a very democratic system, everybody gets their say...but I've always
felt, on other shows, that it tends to knock off all the corners when you do
that.  Doesn't mean good stuff can't get through -- obviously it does -- it
just makes it harder for it to do so, and this is the case for any show that
uses that approach.  At least, from my admittedly subjective point of view.
But trying to tell one person how to tell his or her stories is like telling
somebody how to make love...the advice is invariably unwanted, and usually
inappropriate.
