<pre>     No, had nothing to do with Q, it's deciding what kind of person our 
Mr. Sebastian might've been, and working from  there.  When you have 
a character with as vivid and powerful as his, you don't need 
to look to ST for any ideas on character.  And unlike Q, Sebastian has no
powers of his own, just the force of his personality.
