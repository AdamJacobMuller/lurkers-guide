<pre>&lt;How did Lennier know where to find Delenn?&gt;

     Well, given Delenn's position, I think she'd have let Lennier know 
where she was, or that he'd heard Sheridan tell Delenn in the scene we 
played the voice-over.

     Thanks, it was a good show.

                                                                       jms
