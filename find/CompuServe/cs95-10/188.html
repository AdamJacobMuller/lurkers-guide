<pre>&lt; &gt;&gt; Actually, there *was* a scene where Lennier, concerned, tracks down Kosh 
to inquire after Delenn's situation, which report alarms him and sends him 
after Sheridan.  It was filmed...but cut for time. &lt;&lt;
  Can you post it?&gt;

     Can't really post that kind of stuff, alas....
