<H2> B5: Final Year???		</H2>
<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: October 04, 1995 3:31:29 AM</h3>
<pre>     What's necessary is to understand that the syndication picture has
changed a bit since B5 hit the airwaves.  There are far more programs on now
for stations to choose between (which is why B5 is now airing only once a
week in most markets, to allow stations to include more and different
programs in their line-ups).

     The first year, we only had to sustain our ratings to be renewed for
year two; in year two, we only had to grow modestly to be renewed for year
three; in year three, with all the new programs now available, and WB and
UPN and PTEN and FOX fighting it out for the few remaining slots, we have to
do even better.

     This is the dilemma of *every* TV series, not just B5.  You grow in the
ratings, or you get canceled; networks or syndication, that's the rule. All
we can do is continue to make the best show we can, and hope enough people
hear about it to come and check it out...because if they do, in most cases
they stick around.

     So this is a *very* important time for us; if you have friends who
haven't yet seen the show, give 'em a call and invite them to the party.

                                                                       jms
