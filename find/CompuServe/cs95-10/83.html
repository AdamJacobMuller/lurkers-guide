<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: October 12, 1995 9:09:22 PM</h3>
<pre>     A non-telepath can learn certain tricks to make it harder to break
through, albeit briefly, so the reaction was sufficiently ambiguous and the
event sufficiently brief that it wouldn't raise too many concerns.  Which is
why Sheridan dived in when he did; if she'd continue to block much longer,
just instinctively, it would've revealed her latent potential.  It was his
distracting Ivanova that in a sense helped Lyta break through.
