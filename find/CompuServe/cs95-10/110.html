<pre>     Okay, here's intro lesson #5, on How Hollywood Works, by jms, age 12.

     Writers, the really *good* writers, are few and far between.  Sure,
you've got journeymen and journeywomen, people who can cobble up a decent
story, but the percentage of really *good* writers is the same as it is in
any other venue, a minority.  And of that sampling universe, smaller still
is the group that can write perfectly for *your show*.

     Writer A may be a great writer on series A, B and C, but when it comes
to show D, just doesn't Get It.  Every once in a very great while, someone
walks in the door, and absolutely nails it first time at bat.  That person
is *exactly* suited to your show.  So it's in your best interest to grab
that person and stick him on staff as fast as you humanly can.

     If you bring him in as a staff writer, he can't rewrite others, and
can't verbally participate in story sessions (per WGA rules) with freelance
writers.  His utility is limited, and since there isn't that much difference
in salary between a staff writer and a story editor, you usually bring the
person in as story editor.  Or, if the person has a lot of credits, you
bring him or her in as a producer.

     Hence the preponderance of writer/producers in TV, which has somewhat
become the norm.  Working through freelance scripts is a difficult thing on
the best of days, so there's an understandable impulse to hire a whole bunch
of writers who you know Get It, give them producer titles, and have them do
the lion's share of the writing.  This is how most TV shows are done today.
In a way, it's kind of diminished the title "producer," since many writer
producers don't really produce, it's just a title with more money.  You've
got producers, co-producers, associate producers, executive story editors,
story editors, supervising producers and executive producers.  And even
executive producers don't always participate in the day-to-day operation of
a series, so they've come up with a term that creates a subset of executive
producers, an unofficial term you'll never see on-screen, which is "Show
Runner."  That's the one person who is running the whole darned thing.

     Is all this fairly new?  Yeah, fairly.  There was a time when the
majority of TV shows were written by freelancers, but that was when the WGA
consisted of far fewer writers than today, and it was easier to dip into
that pool.  Now you've got well over 9,000 Writers Guild members, of which
roughly 50% are unemployed at any given moment.  That's a lot of people
scrambling to beat down your door at any moment, and when you factor in the
greater risks these days, the short orders (you used to get a full season's
order, 24 episodes, on networks, now you get 8, then if the ratings hold, 7
more, then a third order for the balance of episoodes, called the Back Nine,
which means you can risk less with outsiders in your first batch), that can
lead to a bunker mentality.

     Did I start out this way?  Sorta.  I've only written two freelance TV
scripts for dramatic series; each time I get hired instantly right
afterward.  On other shows, I'm just hired straight off, no freelance work
required.  I didn't actually set out to be a producer; it was never my plan,
or my goal.  Didn't want the Pointy Hat of Authority.

     But I discovered early on that the only way to make sure nobody rewrote
me, that the words got through as I wanted them to get through, was to go up
the ladder until I became an executive producer/show runner.  It's a hell of
a lot of work.  If someone said, "Look, we'll make you a staff writer, pay
you crappy money...but we won't change your words," I'd take it in a hot
second.  But that hasn't happened, so here I am...in the cannon barrel.

                                                                       jms
