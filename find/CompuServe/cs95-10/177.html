<pre>    &lt;Did Sinclair have to undergo a similar interrogation?  Good show.&gt;

     Bear in mind, though, that we don't yet know, when someone says The 
One, the answer to, "The One *what*?"  When this gets answered later this
season, you may have your answer there.

     And thanks.

                                                                       jms
