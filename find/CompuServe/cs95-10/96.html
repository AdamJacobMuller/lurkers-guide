<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: October 15, 1995 5:06:01 PM</h3>
<pre>     Basically, all that was indicated in the script was that he for a beat
isn't sure what's up...then lets it go.  I generally don't drop specific
points explaining foreshadowing in the scripts, in case they leak out.  If a
line like that isn't sufficiently clear for the actor's intent, they then
come to me and I explain it verbally.  This was done in particular when we
had to shoot "Chrysalis" before "Signs and Portents," even though the latter
aired before the former.

                                                                       jms
