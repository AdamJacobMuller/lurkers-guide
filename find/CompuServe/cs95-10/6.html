<pre>     Your motives in asking the question are beyond doubt; your intent is
clearly sincerely motivated.  It's just that it's been asked so many times
in broad strokes that it's become difficult and leads to flame-wars.

     When one says "what's being done wrong" with another show, then you've
instantly got a value judgement that leads right to subjective argumentation
rather than analysis.  But if you can somehow structure the discussion so
that is analyzes the writing of each show independently, comparing and
contrasting certain techniques or plot elements, more power to you.

                                                                       jms
