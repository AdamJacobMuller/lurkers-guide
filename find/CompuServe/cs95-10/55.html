<pre>     Oh, I won't defend the delay in new episodes, because I think it's
indefensible on many levels.  I just don't think it's appropriate to make
the show into something less than it is to stay on the air; because then the
show you want to keep on the air, that which makes it special, is gone
anyway, so you've lost both ways.  Better to go out on your feet.  But we've
made it 3 years so far, and I have no intention of letting it fall before
finishing the storyline.

                                                                       jms
