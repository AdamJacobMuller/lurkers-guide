<pre>	&lt;&lt;OF course, that raises the question -- Is penance enough?&gt;

	At some point, it must be.  Even the worst of us must have some
hope for reprieve at some point.  Either let the creep out of jail, or kill
him.  I think four hundred years of not knowing would even do justice to
Manson. ...&gt;

     No, I think your points are all excellent, and tie right into the whole 
question at hand.  Nothing soft about them, just very thoughtful and
insightful.  One of the primary functions of the show, beyond entertainment,
is to provoke questions, discussion, and the comparison of views.

     I think my message titled videotapes from jms is still here with an 
address for WB about tapes.

     And thanks.

                                                                       jms
