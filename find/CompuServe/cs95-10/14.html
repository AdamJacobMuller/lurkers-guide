<H2> Major B5/ST News			</H2>
<h3>Section: Star Trek<br>Date: October 04, 1995 3:14:19 PM</h3>
<pre>     It came out of an original announcement that Majel Barrett Roddenberry
would be guest-starring on a B5 episode, and kinda grew from there, so the
start of the thread was definitely ST related.

                                                                       jms
