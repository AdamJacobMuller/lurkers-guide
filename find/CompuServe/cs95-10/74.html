<pre>     Talia v 1.0 would not have violated Ivanova's privacy during any kind
of intimacy, as that would violate her profoundly; you can hold back, and
Talia would have, and Ivanova would've sensed if she had tried it.  The
theory on telepaths making love is that they both willingly drop the blocks
they normally keep in place.
