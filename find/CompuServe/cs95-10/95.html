<pre>     "With all due respect" is a term usually used (in addition to other
places) in military life; it's a way of disagreeing with a superior officer
without getting nailed for insubordination.  If it's used in that context a
lot, it's because that's how it's supposed to be used.

     "To be perfectly frank" doesn't serve the same purpose; the intent is,
"I disagree with your assessment, but that doesn't violate the respect your
position must demand of me."

                                                                       jms
