<pre>     The series is fine as it is.  The changes you suggest would simply make
into a gimmick show, action without substance.  Then it wouldn't be the show
that people like...so what's the point?  I'd rather have it the show I mean
it to be, and die, than compromise and go on.  What we need, primarily, is
good PR to let people know what we're doing.

                                                                       jms
