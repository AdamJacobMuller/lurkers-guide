<pre>     Oh, there's no question that they need to bring up the ratings on DS9,
that's a separate issue, however.  They need the ratings up because
Paramount sells ads based on figures determined by ratings.  They've
promised certain levels of ratings, and if the show doesn't pull those
numbers, they have to give money *back*.  So it's definitely in their
interests to keep the ratings up for as long as the show is on the air.

     And, again, this is more the corporate POV of the situation.  The
potential revenue for their new network *far* outmatches what any single
syndicated show could pull in, and if the latter poses any kind of threat to
the former...it ain't a contest.  Even Berman, in the same article, wonders
if they may have come close to "going to the well too often."

     So we'll have to see...clearly, many of those involved with the show
want it to continue, as do the fans...we'll have to see if the corporate
types feel the same way.

                                                                       jms
