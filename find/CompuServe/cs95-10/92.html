<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: October 13, 1995 8:52:11 PM</h3>
<pre>     Overall, I'd think this is a better question *debated* by folks than
answered by me.  (And there's no one B5 answer, as there are so many varying
belief systems in the B5 universe.)  All I can suggest is that you keep an
eye out for an episode called "Passing Through Gethsemane," around #5 or so;
it may get into some of this.

                                                                       jms
