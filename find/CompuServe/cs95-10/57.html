<h3>Section: Star Trek<br>Date: October 11, 1995 1:33:20 AM</h3>
<pre>     Debbie: thanks.  To avoid a lengthy recap of the O'Hare situation, I
would point you to the B5 library, sec 5, which has a lengthy message from
me on the subject, which should answer just about all of those questions.

     As for the second half of the "Babylon Squared" episode, and all the
questions arising from that...and your question about O'Hare returning...
they both have the same answer.  He'll be reappearing in season three in a
two-part episode that shows the other half of the B^2 storyline.

     Thanks for the kind words.

                                                                       jms
