<pre>&lt;In "The Gathering," was the data Delenn gave Sinclair on the Vorlons really
*everything* -- including the First Ones, the Shadows, etc.?&gt;

     Yeah, there was a lot of info there...it was everything she had *there*
at hand, but not everything the Minbari have overall.

                                                                       jms
