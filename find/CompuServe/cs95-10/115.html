<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: October 16, 1995 11:22:08 PM</h3>
<pre>     1) You're assuming Bester knows everything.  Also, Bester's interest
may have been more...carnal than PsiCorp oriented.

     2) The real Talia was becoming more and more disenchanted with PC, and
this was in time going to pull her into resistance activities, which Talia
v2.0 would only be *thrilled* about.  The self-protection mechanism only
kicks in when the personality's existence is threatened.

     3) Remember that Ironheart was not seeing Talia under the best of
conditions...he was fighting hard NOT to use his abilities, for any reason,
because it created mindquakes...he was pulling everything IN.  And later he
was shot, also not a good position.

     It lays out fine, really.

                                                                       jms
