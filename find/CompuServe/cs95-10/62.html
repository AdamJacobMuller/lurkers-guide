<H2> WOTW: DS9 Imitates B5?		</H2>
<h3>Section: Star Trek<br>Date: October 11, 1995 9:53:14 PM</h3>
<pre>     Ah, I see the infamous Randy Hall of AOL is here, as well.

     In citing the DS9 ratings, you carefully omit the Voyager ratings, which
in many cases in the past have been somewhat *less* than the B5 ratings.
Which kinda takes the air out of the argument, doesn't it?

     Even so, B5 is challenging the ST universe artistically, in terms of
what we put on the screen.  As we hope they will challenge us.

                                                                       jms
