<pre>     Okay, here's one clue for any would-be Ripperologists out there.

     In all the long story of Jack, when he was out doing his nightly work,
only one person, a woman, wrote an actual letter, published in the London
Times, offering an *explanation* for the Ripper's work, arguing that he was
trying to send a message, that maybe people should listen to that message.
It was as close as anyone's ever come to an actual *defense* of what he was
doing.

     Note the woman's name, and who her husband was...a man who was twice
interviewed by Scotland Yard, and interviewed by many Church officials, the
transcripts of which have been *sealed* by the Church ever since, at the
request of the family...a person who was the last man to see at least one of
the victims alive...and who was a direct blood relative of the man who was
living with the final victim (who was killed indoors, leading to the
speculation that she knew her assailant)...who suffered a breakdown just
before the murders began, was obsessed with cleaning up the Whitechapel
area, and after whose sudden, hasty transfer, the murders stopped...and
whose profession is tied *directly* to the only thing the Ripper was
overheard to say to one of his victims.

                                                                       jms
