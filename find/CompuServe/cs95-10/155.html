<pre>     The reason for the placement of the jump points is *very* straight 
forward.

     By virtue of their size and the tremendous forces unleashed by punching
a hole into hyperspace, you want to form it a little distance away or risk
being severely damaged. If they formed the points between them and the
enemy, which was quite capable of avoiding them, it would be entirely
possible for the shadows to get in front of the point and cut off their sole
means of escape.  Usually, better to form them behind you, so the enemy
can't block your way out, and take a possible hit or two to your aft
sections than be totally cut off.  They didn't anticipate the extra weapons
the shadows had.

                                                                       jms
