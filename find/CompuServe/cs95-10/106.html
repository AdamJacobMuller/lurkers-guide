<H2> New DS9 opening = B5?		</H2>
<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: October 15, 1995 8:39:09 PM</h3>
<pre>     I've actually received email from people who say they've been harrassed
by some of the more extreme ST fans for liking B5; one recent correspondent
sent me a note off the usenet describing when he went into an SF bookstore
(that also carried comics, soundtracks, other stuff), and was derided for
wanting the B5 soundtrack, made fun of, told the disk wasn't there, finally
found it hidden behind some other stuff, and endlessly insulted in a way
that was very openly hostile and mean-spirited.  It happens.

                                                                       jms
