<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: October 05, 1995 10:58:06 PM</h3>
<pre>     If I had to look back at season 2 and pick favorites, they'd probably
be "The Long, Twilight Struggle," "Comes the Inquisitor," and "The Coming of
Shadows."  "Coming" is probably the one episode I'd say is most perfect, the
most purely B5.

     In year one, I thought there were a couple/three eps that just lay
there and begged to be shot and put out of their misery.  But I don't think
we had even one like that in year two.  Some were stronger than others, but
not one dropped below a certain median high point over year one.

     So far, year three is another general step up, with our least episode
this season so far being the equal of some of the better year two episodes.

     What makes for a perfect episode of B5 in my view?  It's kinda hard to
define.  It's an episode where major and irreversible events take place,
which were absolutely set up from what went before, and which turn on the
individual choices made by our characters; episodes that have about them the
feel of a car absolutely out of control, that ANYthing could happen...the
kind of episode that makes you start insinctively reaching for the brake
pedal, but it doesn't do any good.  And, finally, those that have a nice
visual sense of style.  I've gradually grown more consistently fond of the
montage as a dramatic device, though I'm being careful not to over-use it.
(I *really* liked the intercutting in the Emperor's fall in "Coming.")

     I'd rather not say anything at all about "Gethsemane," because a large
part of the plot turns on something you need to discover mid-viewing, and
anything I might say would only detract from it.  It's a lovely, sad, very
moving story; it's kind of my Twilight Zone story in the B5 universe, with
some very strong emotional twists as we go along.  It's not the kind of
story I get to do within the B5 structure very often, and I'm extremely
pleased with this one (and Adam Nimoy did a *bang-up* job directing it; he
thinks it may be his best work ever).

     We're now shooting episode #7, "Exogenesis."  So far, to give my own
reactions to the year 3 episodes so far:

     "Matters of Honor," somewhat of a continuation of the year two season
ender, picking up the pieces, with some great action pieces, mainly a fair
amount of fun, which is necessary given what precedes it..."Convictions," a
moody, atmospheric, driving piece, stylistically very different for us, with
some hysterically funny scenes juxtaposed against some deadly serious and
gritty drama..."A Day in the Strife," a fair number of threads, a day in the
life episode with everything that can go wrong going wrong, some elements of
humor but mainly a straight-ahead kind of episode..."Voices of Authority,"
you'll see some of our characters doing stuff they've never done before, and
we get into the whole question of the First Ones, also fairly straightfoward
in storytelling and direction..."Passing Through Gethsemane," which again is
just an utter knockout episode, which with "Convictions" comes close to
being a perfect episode..."Dust to Dust," haven't seen the director's cut
yet, but the dailies looked great...and "Exogenesis," which we just started
filming this week, is probably our most "ordinary" story of the batch,
though it puts a new spin on several traditional story elements.

     On just about every level, I'd say that the year three episodes are an
improvement on the year two episodes, and we've got a lot more this season
that should be equal to or better than "Coming" and the other top three
mentioned earlier, at least based on how they look pre-shooting..."Messages
From Earth," and "Severed Dreams" are massive action/character set pieces on
the scale of "The Long, Twilight Struggle"...only bigger, and more
personal.

     It's going to be great.

                                                                       jms
