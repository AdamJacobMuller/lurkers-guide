<pre>     I think that, in the long run, the vorlons and the shadows will answer 
the questions Who are you and What do you want...in that that's kind of 
what they *are*, if that makes any sense.

     Well, it will.  Eventually.

     Funny thing is, how much as you note the show corresponds to some of
the things Mira's been through...some of it intentional, knowing that if I
dig into this area, it'll come out of her with the ring of truth...some of
it quite unintentional.  When I finished writing "Severed Dreams," and the
actors got it, Mira's first words to me were, "So...how long DID you live in
Yugoslavia?"  The parallel wasn't intentional...but it fit.

                                                                       jms
