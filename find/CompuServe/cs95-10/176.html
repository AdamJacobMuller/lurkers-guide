<pre>     The pain is necessary because it's easy to consider laying down one's 
life intellectually; when the pain and the agony bring it home, it's no
longer as easy.

     And there *is* no correct answer to "Who are you?"  The only real 
answer is no answer, because as soon as you apply someone's term for it, 
you have limited yourself, defined yourself in someone else's terms.

     Doing things in a refined, gentle, intellectual manner is the sort of 
thing Delenn's used to, she can handle that easily...the goal of Sebastian 
was to try and *break* her.  That's not intended to be done gently.  You
don't break someone over a cup of tea discussing philosophical concepts and
the nature of personal identity.  It's also not terribly dramatic to watch.

     Because of her position, rank and authority, she expected to be 
treated a certain way...which was why it was important to treat her just 
the opposite.  It's easy to put oneself into a grand prophecy, to assume
one has a destiny...to pay the price for that is something else again.  
Anyone can do the former; very few can ever do the latter.

                                                                       jms
