<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: October 07, 1995 9:54:07 PM</h3>
<pre>     How long to write a script varies; sometimes a couple weeks, sometimes
just 3-4 days; sometimes less if my back's against the wall, but that's
fairly rare.  Often the ones I write very quickly are better than the ones I
write slowly, because I get it out before I lose track of the fingerprints
of the characters and the passion of the story.

     Once completed, it's anywhere from 3-5 weeks before shooting begins,
which is a luxury in TV...most shows the director doesn't get the script
until a few days before shooting.

                                                                       jms
