<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: October 20, 1995 1:16:25 AM</h3>
<pre>     Well, even without VCRs, eventually the show will be stripped daily 
(one hopes, at least), once the show is over.  
Some here have tried, as an experiment, watching them straight through, one 
per day, and all the clues and bits and foreshadowings jump out immediately 
that way.  So it probably works fine either way.

                                                                       jms
