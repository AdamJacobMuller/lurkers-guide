<pre>     If you're going to have something this big, with that great a video and
audio system, maybe you ought to consider holding this one week later for
"The Long Twilight Struggle," which benefits hugely from this kind of
treatment, and will, I suspect, have a much bigger reaction from those
attending.  Just a thought....
