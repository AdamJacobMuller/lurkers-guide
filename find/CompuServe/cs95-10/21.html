<pre>     Yes, the first batch of eps from season 3, up through 9 or so, give a
lot more background on the shadow ships, what they are and how they work.
And as you say, virtually everything in this show is here for a reason;
there's an offhand remark from Garibaldi in "Infection" about his long
struggle out of the Martian desert that pays off in both the comic, and in a
third-season episode.  So some of the year three stuff was being set up as
early as episode 2 of year 1, in what was designed to look like just plain
old throwaway dialogue.

                                                                       jms
