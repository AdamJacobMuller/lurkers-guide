<pre>     Re: craft...it's not any one area per se, really, just a lot of little
things.  "Trifles make perfection, and perfection is no trifle."
Michelangelo.  So I keep trying one technique or another, working to get a
little better, or add different tools to my toolbox.

     Favorite visual moments?  The last shots in the second major action
piece in TLTS (the through the window stuff).  The Emperor's fall in CoS.
Delenn and Sheridan embracing, and Lennier's exit from the isolation area
in C&amp;L.  Some of the staging in CtI.

     We just have to continue to get better, and never look back.
