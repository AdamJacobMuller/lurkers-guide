<pre>     Actually, we just got the overnights from the first day's ratings of
the first of the Final Four, and they're quite good...in LA, for instance,
where DS9 got a 5.9 rating and a 9 share, B5 got a 6.3 rating and a 10
share.  So we're getting there....

                                                                       jms
