<H2> WOTW: DS9 Imitates B5?		</H2>

<pre>     Of course, the one good thing to come out of all this is what I've been
saying all along...that the presence of lots of SF shows will cause more
competition between the shows, with the ultimate beneficiary of this being
the audience.

     Case in point: from day one, B5 has always shown the station very busy,
with lots of ships going and coming.  One of the concerns voiced by many DS9
fans, quite logically, was that if this was such a busy station, why did we
not see any ships docking at the station, a sense of being busy?  Well,
finally, we now see the new open to DS9 where they show a fair number of
ships moving in and out.  We've been doing lots of scenes with huge numbers
of ships dating back to the pilot movie; now in the season debut, they've
come to the plate and shown big numbers of ships.  Granted that several of
the big shots were recycled throughout the course of the episode (watch for
the wide shot where you see a Klingon ship in front of the crowd moving
right to left, for instance), still it's a strong effort.

     Our presence gives them some competition to do more, and as they come
up to the plate to do just that, it challenges *us* to rise to the occasion
as well, so it's a good back-and-forth.

                                                                        jms
