<pre>     Actually, I have my own suspicion about his identity, and have dug out
quite a bit of supporting evidence.  It's not a name anyone's heard before
in this context.  I've spoken with a few other high-credibility
Ripperologists, and apparently there are some others who have begun focusing
on this person.  So we'll see....

                                                                       jms
