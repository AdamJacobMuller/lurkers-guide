<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: October 20, 1995 1:16:28 AM</h3>
<pre>&lt;I noticed that this week's episode of seaQuest was written by Javier 
Grillo-(can't remember spelling).  This was the fellow who wrote the letter 
asking for opinions on how to fix the show wasn't it?&gt;

     Since I didn't see it, I can have no real coherent thoughts (as if I 
could on any day)....

                                                                       jms
