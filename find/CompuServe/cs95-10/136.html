<pre>     Actually, what Delenn said was, "...the Rangers *in this area* are 
under my direct command."  So Sinclair's post as Ranger One remains back on 
Minbar.

     And yes, Sinclair has apparently been described as the One...but you 
must ask...the one *what*?

     Expect final answers to this one late this coming season.

                                                                       jms
