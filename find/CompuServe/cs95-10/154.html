<pre>&lt;I am totally stunned and speechless from this episode.  Joe, let me tell 
you, I CRIED in this episode.&gt;

     Thanks.  I'm very pleased with that episode; your response was just 
what I was hoping for.  Thanks again.

                                                                       jms
