<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: October 28, 1995 9:47:04 PM</h3>
<pre>&lt;Where do you see Lennier and Delenn having been, and where do you 
see the two of them going?  My commendations to Mira on her 
acting in this one.  Thanks for a terrific episode.&gt;

     Yes, Mira's great in that episode.

     As for Lennier...it's an unusual relationship, which you'll learn a 
LOT more about in "Ceremonies of Light and Dark."  Which is all I can say
for now.

                                                                       jms
