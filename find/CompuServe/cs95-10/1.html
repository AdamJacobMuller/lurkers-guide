<pre>     "I don't think that (B5) would be doing too well if it was a clone of ST."

     (Actually, that should be *were*, not *was*...just to be pedantic.)

     That is, in a nutshell, part of the problem we faced going in.  On the
one hand, you have the ST fans who, understandably, hadn't heard about what
B5 was, or that it preceded DS9 by 5 years.  (This thanks to the new PR
philosophy at Warner Bros., which strives to create the notion of stealth
programming...that which cannot be picked up on radar, sonar, TV or infrared
motion detectors.)  Not their fault, in other words.  Thinking the show was
just a DS9 ripoff, many of them opted out...again, understandably, given the
circumstances.

     Then you have those viewers who tuned in expecting to see something
like ST, found it wasn't, and decided we weren't doing ST or SF correctly
because of that, and did a fast fade.

     Finally you had the non-ST fans, who assumed it was just like ST (in
some cases in part because some of the comments lent themselves to that; one
station astonishingly enough even said, "From the creators of DS9," which
probably astonished Berman/Pillar about as much as it did me), and thus
didn't check it out, assuming it was just more of the same.

     Consequently...we fell between three chairs.  It has taken time for
people to get the word about what the show *really* is (mainly word of
mouth; to some extent we are still a stealth program).  As they've made that
discovery, a task no less daunting than the first trans-Atlantic crossing by
canoe, our audience has grown slowly but steadily.

     TeeVee...it's a mug's game, Brenna.

                                                                       jms
