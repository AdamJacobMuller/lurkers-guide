<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: October 12, 1995 4:37:14 PM</h3>
<pre>     An interesting thought...as for Bester's personality, keep an eye out
for "Dust to Dust," episode #6, where you see Bester from a different and
very interesting angle.  Some of what you say here, he says.  (Not about the
corps, but about doing what's right as he sees it.)

     'Course, whether or not one should *believe* anything he says is another
question altogether.

                                                                       jms
