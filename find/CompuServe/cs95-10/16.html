<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: October 05, 1995 3:03:12 AM</h3>
<pre>     The only reason the ratings have slipped (which they never mention in
the trades) is that we've been in reruns since *MAY*, just running the same
18 episodes over and over and over.

     We'll get a better picture in a few weeks.

                                                                       jms
