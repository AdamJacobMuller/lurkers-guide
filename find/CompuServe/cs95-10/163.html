<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: October 26, 1995 12:34:30 PM</h3>
<pre>      Not that it just looked better per se, but the gunshots came from 
right to left; the gun hand as originally shot fired from left to right.  
It looked very funky when edited together, like it was going in a different 
direction than the one it was fired in.  Flopping the shot corrected that.

                                                                       jms
