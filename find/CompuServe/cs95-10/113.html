<pre>     Basically, when you go into someone else's company, as much as you may
advise, suggest, and carry on, ultimately it's not your company, and you're
bound by the way other people do business.

     Some people can license a product, for instance, but because the show
isn't a proven money-producer in licensing, they may want to hedge their
bets; they may not invest as much money into production, or publicity, or
artistic contributers of one sort or another.  So the choices you then get
to approve may not be the ultimate best  possible in a theoretical world in
terms of pushing the envelope or being as daring as the show.  Their
inclination is to  play it safe.

     As time goes on, and people become reassured that B5 products will work
for them, they will be more comfortable investing more money into them,
which in turn will attract more artistic types, which then leads to more
daring or unique stuff.

     The first few novels were, I thought, fairly prosaic; the next batch
are, I think, more interesting...because the book company is now putting a
little more effort and thought into the product, since the first 3 volumes
have very much proven their worth.  And the list of writers on the next
batch is very good, includng SM Stirling and Neal Barret Jr.

     It's a growing process....

                                                                       jms
