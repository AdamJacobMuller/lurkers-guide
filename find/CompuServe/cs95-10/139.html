<pre>&lt;Draal's hookup to the machine is similar to the game Warhammer 40,000&gt;

     No, never saw Warhammer.  The machine isn't primarily there to 
sustain, it's basically a control mechanism.  This game is a new one on me.

                                                                       jms
