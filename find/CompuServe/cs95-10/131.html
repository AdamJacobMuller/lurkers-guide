<pre>     I've never given much thought to the home video market; I don't get a 
direct piece of it, and it's a secondary revenue stream as far as PTEN is 
concerned and thus not very important, as testified to by the fact that they 
still haven't even put any cassettes OUT in the US.

                                                                       jms
