<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: October 11, 1995 11:22:02 PM</h3>
<pre>     The most difficult part on one level is probably the writing, because
that's the one time I'm up on the high-wire entirely by myself; in every
other aspect of the show, you've got other people, costume designers, EFX
people, others who can keep you from falling.  Behind the keyboard, if you
screw up, you've got no one to catch you.

     On another level, the most physically difficult is the editing process,
where we go over each episode frame by frame and edit it to within an inch
of its life.  It's a very detailed and wearing process.

     We definitely plan to do more with Lennier next season.

                                                                       jms
