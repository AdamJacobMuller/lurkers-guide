<H2> VOYAGER'S BAD TREK		</H2>
<h3>Section: Star Trek<br>Date: October 06, 1995 8:19:24 PM</h3>
<pre>     Actually, let me correct myself on one point; just to be sure of my
quote, I went back and checked the LA Times article, and the most pertinent
comment came not from Berman/Piller but from Kerry McCluggage, who is the
Chairman of the Paramount Pictures Television Group (i.e., the man who makes
all the final decisions on the life and death of the Mountain's syndicated
series, and the UPN series).

     McCluggage, the article states, "pointed out that Next Generation and
the original Star Trek series still air in repeats in hundreds of markets.
'If you on some level buy the concept that there's a finite number of Star
Trek viewers, who only have so much time to watch their favorite program,
it's going to split the pie a little bit."

     Offered in the interests of accuracy.
