<pre>     Because you're still hooked into the way the non-B5 world does things.
We're kind of obsessive about stuff here.

     Yes, I do have approval over everything, and while a few things
could've been better with the cards, I'm overall quite pleased.  It's a
start.  Remember, we're still in the process of convincing people that there
really is interest in the show, so the miracle isn't whether or not a given
product was done well, rather that it was done at *all*.  So these so far
are fine, and we'll continue to improve.

                                                                       jms
