<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: October 26, 1995 2:18:02 PM</h3>
<pre>      The episode underlines that there are two fundamental questions in 
B5: who are you, and what do you want?  The order in which you answer
those two questions can either make you great...or destroy you.

      As for "There...plain truth!"  Someone elsewhere noted that this is 
how we work sometimes...we hand you our play book quite openly, we tell
you we're coming right up the middle, try and stop us.

                                                                       jms
