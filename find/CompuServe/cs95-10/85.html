<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: October 12, 1995 9:09:28 PM</h3>
<pre>     Well, we just this week hit the air with the final four of last year,
and we haven't even hit the year three ratings period in November, so at
this juncture I'd say it's premature to start worrying about some of this.
The best thing to do, for everyone, is to keep in constant touch with your
local stations, via letter, and let them know what you think about the show.
Because we live and die at the station level.

                                                                       jms
