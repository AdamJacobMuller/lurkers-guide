<pre>     Re: your note about 500 Narns for every 1 Centauri...you may want to 
check our own history.  During the occupation of some parts of Europe 
during WW II, similar tactics were used.  
In some cases the threat rose as high as 100-200 Jews or Russians executed 
for every Nazi killed; much the same has been done in earlier history.  
Five hundred to one is a figure relatively consistent with what humans have 
done from time to time when we wish to instill terror.  So I find this a 
curious quibble.

                                                                       jms
