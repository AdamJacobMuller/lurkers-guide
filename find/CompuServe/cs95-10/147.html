<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: October 20, 1995 8:08:13 PM</h3>
<pre>&lt;The Vorlons lodged an official protest.  Was that the first time the
Vorlons acted so directly (since the eternal life episode, at least)?&gt;

     Yeah, that's pretty much the first time since the pilot where the 
Vorlons got involved with the Sinclair situation.

                                                                       jms
