     Sysops:

     As a note, there's probably no reason to repost this message again; I 
think it might be overkill, and while I felt it 
was right to come in here once to announce this, it *is* the ST section and 
shouldn't have to put up with multiple 
raids of the same message.

     As an aside, Majel is shooting this week on B5, and so far seems to be 
enjoying it immensely.  She's having great fun working with Peter Jurasik 
and Stephen Furst.

                                                                       jms

<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: October 28, 1995 2:30:25 PM</h3>
<pre>&lt;I saw a mention of Bruce Boxleitner's coming on board in an issue of 
TV Guide and decided to make an effort to check on the show -- and got 
hooked.

Episodes of Babylon5 really are like reading a chapter of a science fiction 
novel every week.&gt; 

     Thanks, and I'm glad you made it to the show.  Bruce is nothing but 
terrific to work with.  And I think you'll like where we're going over the
next 6 weeks in particular....
