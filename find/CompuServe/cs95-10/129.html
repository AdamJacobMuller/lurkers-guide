<H2> WOTW: DS9 Imitates B5?		</H2>
<h3>Section: Star Trek<br>Date: October 18, 1995 4:36:04 PM</h3>
<pre>     Not backwards at all when one considers that in general B5's ratings
have been slowly, consistently improving in non-rerun periods since it went
on the air.  No, it didn't start out in the top figures because it didn't
have the ST name that guarantees ratings.  It's had to find its audience,
and vice versa.  And this it has been doing.

     In LA, the first new episode of B5, aired right after a new DS9
episode, got a 6.3 rating and a 10 share, as opposed to a 5.3/9 for DS9.

     And even *absent* all that...even a lower rated show can challenge one
artistically.  Twin Peaks never got the big numbers, but it had a major
impact in breaking open some of the elements that others have used since, in
shows like X-Files and American Gothic and others.

     On this whole question...if you saw the DS9 2-hour debut, with the
action scenes, you may want to check out the show airing this week.  You
might find it interesting....
