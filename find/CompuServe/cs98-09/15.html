      Evan's an amazing composer...he came out of Shanghai, studied
music in Russia and Germany, was fast becoming a leading, classically
trained composer, and discovered jazz in his twenties, dropped
everything to come to Chicago and study under some of the best jazz men
around (even if it meant washing dishes to get by).  His stuff is the
most amazing blend of asian influence, classical instrumentation, jazz
and rock backbeats I've ever heard, even using asian scales (somewhat
different from western musical scales) in unexpected places to make
western music sound totally different.

      For a show as different as this, I wanted a completely
different, totally unique sound, something I've never heard before, and
Evan Chen has it.
