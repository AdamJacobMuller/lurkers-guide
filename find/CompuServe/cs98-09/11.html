<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Joe, how is everything going with production?
&gt; And, more importantly, how are you feeling?

      Things are going well overall; we've filmed 5 episodes, and have
just extended a planned 1 week production hiatus (we take two such
hiatuses -- hiati? -- every year, one in the fall, one in the spring)
and added three paid weeks in order to allow time for construction on a
number of new sets.

                                                                  jms
