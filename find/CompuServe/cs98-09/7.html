<pre> Deonaha M. Conlin &lt;102531.2627@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; BTW - how are YOU feeling?
&gt; How long do we have to wait now?

      I've been looking at that photo some more, and the more I stare
at it, the more it bugs me, because it's just awful in how it was
taken: you can see the shadows from the flashbulb, it's not composed
well, it looks like a snapshot taken by somebody non-professional, and
the more I think about it, the more I'm not sure where the hell that
shot came from.  We sure as heck didn't provide it.

                                                                  jms
