"...now all those old uniforms are going to go to waste more than
likely, meanwhile, they're a hell of a lot better than that cheesier
new design they've come up with; a pity."

      Funny, everybody said that about our Earthforce uniforms when
the first pictures appeared.  Now they're the preferred standard.

      Further, those uniforms are specific to the mission of the
Excalibur, as uniforms vary within the real military.  The regular
Earthforce uniforms are still very much in use in the Crusade universe.

      Y'know, I'd've thought that, after learning the lessons on B5
about not judging things too quickly -- the costumes are stupid, who's
the guy with the big hair -- that people would have learend to not
prejudge things before they actually see them on film.

      Guess I was wrong.

                                                                  jms
