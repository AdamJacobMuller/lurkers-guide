<pre> Carl Cantarella &lt;105030.3700@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is Christopher Franke still part of the team, or do you bring in
&gt; someone new?

      We haven't yet set a composer for Crusade; we're giving a shot
to Evan Chen, a chinese-born classical composer with a strong jazz
background, on A Call to Arms.  How that turns out will determine much
that follows.

                                                                  jms
