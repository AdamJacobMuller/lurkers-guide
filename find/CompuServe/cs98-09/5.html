<pre>{original post had no questions}

      Let me suggest that the photo does not show the uniforms off to
best advantage.  They are based strongly on West Point uniforms, with
some variation.  The photo is an awful photo, it looks like a polaroid,
and makes them look pretty flat and unattractive.  On actual film, lit
well, they look very nice.

                                                                  jms
