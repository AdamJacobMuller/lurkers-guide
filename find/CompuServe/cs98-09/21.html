<pre> Steve Kuziel &lt;74150.350@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Will it also include the movies subsequent to "The Gathering"?

      No, I was referring to the WB deal, which was what you asked
about.  I do know that the WB home video covers all five seasons, I
don't know about Columbia House for sure.

                                                                  jms
