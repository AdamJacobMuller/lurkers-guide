<pre> Ray Pelzer &lt;70475.1263@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Withdrawn?
&gt; I realize you probably can't elaborate too much on the
&gt; circumstances, butdid they back down because of YOUR fury,
&gt; because of viewer complaint, or did you go the quick and easy
&gt; route and sic Harlan on 'em?? On a note of more immediate urgency,
&gt; how is your recuperation going?????

      All that matters is that wisdom prevailed.

      And I'm well past the pneumonia, and doing much better now.

                                                                  jms
