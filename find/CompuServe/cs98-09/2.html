<H2>Dark Genesis standalone?</H2>

<pre> Mike Bjorkman &lt;71603.3207@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I'm looking forward to reading Dark Genesis, and I'm also
&gt; wondering - would it make sense to someone who had never watched
&gt; B5? That is, would it make a reasonable introduction to the B5
&gt; universe for friends who haven't yet been turned on to the show?

      Actually, it's more accessible to a new reader than any of the
prior B5 books...it's a totally self-contained work that begins long
before any of our regular characters are born.  I wanted this to be a
solid novel that could exist entirely on its own, absent any knowledge
of B5, but which would tie into the arc for anybody who knows the show.
I think it succeeds admirably.

                                                                  jms
