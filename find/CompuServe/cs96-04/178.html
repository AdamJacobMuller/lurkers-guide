<H2>SD: Boarding Party</H2>
<h3>Date: 09-Apr-96 12:14:04</h3>
<pre> Steve Ramage &lt;74731.235@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; What was the decision making process behind the costuming of the
&gt; EarthForce boarding party? How does that go again, and who said
&gt; it?

       Exactly.  These aren't perfect or superior people...they're
just like us, faced with the same problems we're faced with.  What's
inspiring is seeing that people just like us *can* overcome these
things...at great price, yes, with great difficulty, yes, but if we
decide to act, we can succeed.

       And yes, instead of going for a sinister EA look, I wanted the
uniforms to be something we're used to, "our side," as you say.  There
aren't many blacks-and-whites on this show.  It's all greys...and
sometimes olive drab.

                                                                  jms
