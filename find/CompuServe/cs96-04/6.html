<pre> Bill Hirst &lt;104106.431@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Didn't G'Kar ask Lyta about interspecies mating in the pilot with
&gt; the intention of producing a telepathic Narn?

       Yes, he did ask her about mating, and in the course of that
discussion mentioned the genetic manipulation that would be required.

                                                                  jms
