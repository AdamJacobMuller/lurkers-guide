       Thanks.  I'm looking to find a way to bring Franklin's father
back into the storyline now, to help resolve this.  (Note: no
suggestions, please.)  I think he would tend to fall on the other side,
and it'd be good to show that some people may think that yes, there's a
problem, but you solve that problem from within, not by breaking away. 
Could make for some nice drama....
