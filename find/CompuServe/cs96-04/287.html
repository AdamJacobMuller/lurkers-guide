      Actually, no, the song in "Ceremonies" was not intended as a
Prisoner riff or homage of any kind.  If the song originated with The
Prisoner, that'd be one thing, but the song goes back a long, LONG ways
before The Prisoner was even thought of.

      What happened, actually, was this...I'm a big fan of the Red
Clay Ramblers, a terrific group that does sort of bluegrass but very
offbeat.  I was writing that episode, and I was playing with the
torture aspect, and had one of their albums on.  At just the moment I
got to that scene, up came their rendition of "Ezekiel in the Valley of
the Dry Bones."  The notion was perfect, so I went back to the original
version of the song, which is public domain (rather than their
variation on it), and used it.  Synchronicity.

                                                                  jms
