<H2>SD: The Roanoke</H2>
<h3>Date: 08-Apr-96 23:11:22</h3>
<pre> Bernard F. Dowdy, J &lt;76550.347@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; How did the Earth Alliance destroyer, Roanoke come by its name?

      Well, Roanoke is a place rich with history.  Some of it a little
odd, given the colony's disappearance, but rich nonetheless.  (Clark
has edged away from giving Omega class destroyers and others names from
Greek mythology and history, toward more conventional names like the
Clarkstown and the Roanoke.)

                                                                  jms
