       Thanks.  Yeah, we could've gone for something more expensive,
but our sense for now is to make it as accessible as possible, not to
turn this into a big profit venture.  This will about cover the
expenses, after a certain number of memberships, or a little less.  But
that's okay.

                                                                  jms
