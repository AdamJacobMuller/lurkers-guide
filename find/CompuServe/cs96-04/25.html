<H2>Season 6, 7 ...</H2>
<h3>Date: 02-Apr-96 22:33:19</h3>
<pre> John M. Graham &lt;74166.3727@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I know you have said that Babylon 5 will run only 5 seasons, but
&gt; I cannot see how this can be possible? Without a season 6, to what
&gt; will WB tack on the last Eight or so episodes of season 5? Are the
&gt; upcoming 8 episodes all we're due to get until fall?

      I don't know about the "after the eight" matter; it's possible
that we could get 2 more run in July, the rest, I dunno...could be
sooner, could be later.  We won't know this for a while yet.

                                                                  jms
