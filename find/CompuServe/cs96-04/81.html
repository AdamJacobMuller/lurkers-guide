      Except, of course, you now have an extraordinary situation in
which the Major, through the death of his CO, was now the commanding
officer of the Alexander.  In ordinary circumstances, this would mean
he'd be given a field promotion.

      Second, I don't recall any situation where the Major was "giving
orders to a commander."  The aide on the deck of the Alexander was a
Lieutenant, as I recall.  Also, if Hague indicated that he was to be
given command as he died, that would likely be honored.  Finally, yes,
the Major was involved in the discussions of strategy, but in *every
case* he presented Sheridan and Hiroshi with options, and because it
was Sheridan's neck of the woods, it was left to Sheridan to give
orders.  He coordinated the defense, and was the only one speaking
directly with the Agrippa.

                                                                  jms
