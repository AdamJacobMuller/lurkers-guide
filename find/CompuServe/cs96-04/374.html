      Can I just put the lie to this once and for all?

      It was never, NEVER my intention, and I never stated, that the
Minbari were hermaphroditic, or that Delenn was then hermaphroditic. 
It was NEVER stated that they all went through a male-female change, so
it had NOTHING to do with the Left Hand of Darkness.

      The idea initially was to use a female playing a male character
because it added an offbeat, somewhat androgynous look to the
character, which I thought might be good for the character.  It was
only upon entering the chrysalis, and emerging, that Delenn would a) be
more human, and b) be female. When I discovered that the voice change
wasn't working as well as I'd hoped it would, electronically altering
it, I finally scrapped that aspect of it, but kept the human/minbari
change aspect.

                                                                  jms
