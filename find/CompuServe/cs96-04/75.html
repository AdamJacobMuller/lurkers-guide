      Thanks.  Yes, it's designed to get you revved up at the retreat,
it's our natural reaction.  The TV Logic thing to do would be to go to
black at that point, and the commercial.  But this show is about
consequences, choices and responsibility, and to *not* have that last
scene would be a betrayal of that.  Otherwise it's just jingoism.

                                                                  jms
