<H2>&lt;STV - clarifications?&gt;</H2>
<h3>Date: 17-Apr-96 21:51:12</h3>
<pre> Michael Beemer &lt;71551.1670@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; 1) In the teaser, other than as a counterpoint to the "joke" Vir
&gt; was told, what were all the Narn doing there? Was this a bit of
&gt; license you took to tweak us with the teaser? Were these relatives
&gt; of other Narn ready to settle the score for their relatives (who
&gt; they've been told are "dead")? Were these Narn on the way through
&gt; an Underground Railroad (on *Centauri Prime*???)? 2) What happened
&gt; with the captured Narn at the end of the episode? Has all this
&gt; been handled off screen, or will we see further ramifications in
&gt; the future? Or, is that another comet going by?

      I could've *sworn* there was a line there about the Narn
recovering; I'm going to have to check this.  I hope I didn't
accidentally cut it for time while doing something else.  (It was a
LONG editing session.)

      I figured the Narns were there to discuss the fates of their
families back home, but yeah, to a certain degree it was there as a
great end for the teaser.

                                                                  jms
