<pre> Michael Grabois &lt;74737.2600@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Speaking of Londo's accent, I'm assuming that different Centauri
&gt; accents represent people from different areas of the planet? 
&gt; Anything significant in all this, or just a bit of
&gt; differentiation?

      No, we've just always assumed that not everyone on any given
planet is going to speak with the same accent as everybody else from
that planet. Seems more realistic.

      Certainly, among Centauri, a certain accent is more associated
with the "old school" of court nobility and the like.

                                                                  jms
