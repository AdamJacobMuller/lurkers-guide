<pre> Michael Grabois &lt;74737.2600@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Incidentally, when season 3 started here, one of the biggest
&gt; topics of conversation was the shot of the Starfuries firing on
&gt; each other from the opening credits: what could have led to that? 
&gt; Was that scene from "Severed Dreams", from another episode, or
&gt; was it made up especially for the opening credits?

      The opening shot was made specifically for the title sequence,
as (for lack of a better term) a bit of foreshadowing.  We generally
put our cards right out in plain view for people to see.

                                                                  jms
