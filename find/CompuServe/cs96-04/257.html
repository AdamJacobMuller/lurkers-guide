<pre> Dimitri M LaBarge &lt;71501.3353@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Any others that you can mention offhand?

      Space Cases uses a variation on the 5-year arc, a lot of what
they're doing with their sets and CGI and other areas nods to B5...and
there are two new shows in the works that very definitely rely on the
B5 model, though I'm not at liberty (as a courtesy to them) to discuss
them at this time.

                                                                  jms
