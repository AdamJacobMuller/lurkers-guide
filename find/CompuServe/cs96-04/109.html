<h3>Date: 07-Apr-96 13:50:49</h3>
<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Did she mean on the WS, or the Grey Council cruiser, or Minbar?
&gt;  -Was Sandra Hidoshi related to Sinclair's Senator contact in
&gt; season 1?

      Several corrections to your note:

      1) That was not Ta'Lon in the episode.  He didn't appear
anywhere in this episode.

      2) Jerry didn't hide his broken arm in the pocket because it
wasn't broken at that time.  That scene was shot previous to the
earlier scene (we shoot out of sequence, like all shows).

      3) It's Sandra Hiroshi, not Hidoshi, so no relation to the
senator.

                                                                  jms
