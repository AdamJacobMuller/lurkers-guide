<H2>&lt;Sic Transit Vir&gt;</H2>
<h3>Date: 22-Apr-96 18:59:43</h3>
<pre> William H. DiPaola &lt;76521.1751@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; The Centauri who was speaking to Vir at the beginning of the last
&gt; episode --did he know about what Vir was doing in funneling
&gt; through the Narns to safety?

      No, he didn't know, and would've been horrified if he had.

                                                                  jms
