<pre> Ray Pelzer &lt;70475.1263@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I presume there was some dialog snipped giving him a new pinpoint
&gt; location for the pod?

      That was because the Narns just kept right on going, even when
he'd said "we'll wait here."  That's Narns for you.

                                                                  jms
