<pre> John Bendel [MA] &lt;73447.741@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Were they wearing new uniforms as it appeared?

      Thanks.

      Re: Foxworth...it was really the only thing to do.  I'd created
the character *specifically* to have him available for this episode,
after which he'd basically fade away while others took up his standard.
It was all leading up to this.  Without being in this episode, there
was nothing more to do with Hague, hence I felt quite comfortable with
his fate, it changed nothing.

                                                                  jms
