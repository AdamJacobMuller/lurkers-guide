<H2>B5 Cancellation RUMOR</H2>
<h3>Date: 09-Apr-96 17:58:20</h3>
<pre> Chris Biebel &lt;102414.3341@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Does this mean that B5 will now have a standard time and day so
&gt; that I won't have to check the listings every week to make sure
&gt; it hasn't been moved?

       No, scheduling still remains at the whim of the station.

                                                                  jms
