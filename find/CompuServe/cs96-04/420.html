<H2>&lt;Death of Ducat&gt;</H2>
<h3>Date: 28-Apr-96 15:43:34</h3>
<pre> JOHN GRAVES &lt;102735.1124@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; How was she able to have his "blood on my hands" if the ship was
&gt; destroyed?

      Franklin's line in Avalon indicates that a couple of ships were
destroyed *and* Dukhat was killed.  You basically had one big convoy
meeting another; the ship on which Dukhat was present was badly damaged
but not destroyed.  Dukhat and a number of others on board were killed.

                                                                  jms
