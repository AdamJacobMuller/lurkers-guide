      Thanks, and thanks especially for the comment about Delenn.  She
really hit home here for a lot of people, and the exchange was a good
one.

      I think we may have done something quite extraordinary here. 
One hopes for that, of course, always...but I've finally allowed myself
to think we may actually have done it.

                                                                  jms
