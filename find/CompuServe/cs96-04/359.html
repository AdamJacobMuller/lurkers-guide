<pre> Rebecca Eschliman &lt;76072.2345@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; As to those problematic press releases, for whom and what purpose
&gt; are they originally intended?

      Yeah, there's a smidge of Alizon in Lyndisty, mainly in grammar
and word choice.  As for the releases...they're not press releases,
they're synopses sent to the stations for only their use.  They were
never meant for general distribution.  Happily, one source of the
synopses has offered to stop putting them out, so that'll be a major
help to us.

                                                                  jms
