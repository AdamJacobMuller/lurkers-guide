<pre> John M. Kahane &lt;102664.773@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; (Btw, is there any chance that we can get a date, as in month and
&gt; day, for this event?) Is it safe to say that the actual E-M war
&gt; started within the same year, or did it start a year later? 
&gt; Anything you can add to this would be of tremendous help.) Are we
&gt; actually likely to learn more about the circumstances surrounding
&gt; the Prometheus's attack on the Minbari ship and all?

      The contact was made late in the year, and while that was the
first blow, it takes a while for any war to really get going; you
aren't at war instantly.  The Minbari had to pull their forces
together, make the open declaration of war, establish supply lines and
all the other elements needed for warfare.

                                                                  jms
