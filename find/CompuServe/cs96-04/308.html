<pre> Simon Grierson &lt;100407.2075@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; After re-running that sequence, (Trying to find if it actually
&gt; exploded) I noticed it sort of Flashed - and I thought I saw some
&gt; kind of....skeleton? And then when it was finally ripped apart -
&gt; it Shattered? Are my eyes playing tricks or is this how you
&gt; intended?

       I think that was mainly the energy coursing along it.

                                                                  jms
