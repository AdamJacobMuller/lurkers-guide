       Each caste populates the ships in their jurisdiction with their
own people.  Which is why those on the Minbari warships that came in,
which we'll see shortly, are religious caste, no warriors among
them...but even the religious caste is well trained in combat, as part
of their education in temple.  We've seen some of this already in
Lennier's abilities in a fight.

                                                                  jms
