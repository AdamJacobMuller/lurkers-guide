<H2>&lt;Ceremonies Question&gt;</H2>
<h3>Date: 07-Apr-96 14:16:02</h3>
<pre> James R. Kapesis &lt;104154.27@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; In "Ceremonies of Light and Dark" why did G'Kar not accept
&gt; Delenn's invitation to the Rebirth Ceremony? G'Kar been trying for
&gt; awhile to become part of the army of light, why would he turn
&gt; down a chance to get closer to Delenn?

      Because he saw the actual co-running of security, and their
duties, more important...that is physical, and concrete, and he feels
is his surest way to win a seat in the new council.  Actions, not
ceremonies.  He's very direct that way.  (Which is pretty much what he
said at the time.)

                                                                  jms
