<pre> Dana Wright &lt;72627.531@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I wonder if you will be convering the economics of what has
&gt; happened to B5? Who is paying those dock workers and in what?
&gt; Perhaps you may yet write thos volumes and include all those
&gt; tidbits left on the cutting room floor or topics like what
&gt; happened when the doctor learned his father had died? What about
&gt; appendixes that discuss the histories of all the known races or
&gt; the previous wars with the dark?

      Thanks, and yes, we do get into the question now of who pays for
what, and how.  It's a natural, logical progression.

                                                                  jms
