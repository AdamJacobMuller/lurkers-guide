<pre> John M. Graham &lt;74166.3727@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Any chance of talking WB into some sort of two-hour special at
&gt; some highlight of the arc, or is this just too difficult in
&gt; syndication?

       It's too difficult to sell a one-shot thing like that in
syndication, I've been told.

                                                                  jms
