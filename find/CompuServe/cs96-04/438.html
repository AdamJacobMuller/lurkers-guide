<pre> Michael Grabois &lt;74737.2600@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; In that outline you have in your computer or wherever (the one
&gt; that's triple encrypted), how much detail do you have the series
&gt; mapped out? Obviously the major points -- who does what to whom,
&gt; and where it happens -- are there, but what about the little
&gt; stuff? Is Season 5 mapped out in great detail or just rough
&gt; outline?

      It varies; some aspects are extensively mapped out, some are
left a little open to allow for spontaneity.  A lot is in a
triple-encrypted computer file, which I consult as needed; the rest I
carry in my head.

                                                                  jms
