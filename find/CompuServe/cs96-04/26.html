<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Out of curiosity, however, was Ta'Lon killed in the attack on the
&gt; station, or was my nearsightedness just flaring up?

      Thanks, and Ta'Lon is still alive and well.

      It's a good episode, no mistake.

                                                                  jms
