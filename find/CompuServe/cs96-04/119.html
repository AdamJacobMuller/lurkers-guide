<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; a) Will those Minbari warships be staying with Babylon 5?
&gt; b) Was that Minbari that Delenn talked to beofre meeting with the
&gt; Grey Council the same one as in "There All the Honour Lies"?

      No, the Minbari wasn't Ashan, no.  And yes, the Minbari war
cruisers will be staying for a while...but they know they can't rely on
Minbari protectino forever.  They have to take control of the
situation.

                                                                  jms
