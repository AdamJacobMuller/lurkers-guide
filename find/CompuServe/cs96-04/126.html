<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Why have we not seen any scenes showing the people in the
&gt; opposing forces?

      We haven't seen those scenes because we don't know anyone there
really, and in an hour show you only have so much time, and within our
budget we only can do so much.  Every speaking role you add costs
thousands of dollars. Every set costs thousands of dollars.

      We're doing the absolute best we can with a budget roughly 1/2
of any of the ST episodes.

      If it isn't *absolutely necessary* to the scene, it isn't in. 
Yeah, seeing some folks in EA talking back and forth about well, maybe
this isn't a good idea, maybe it is, well, let's get back to
work...it'd be an interesting aside, but in addition to slowing down
the pace of the episode, and this one had to move like a house afire,
it's just not something I felt we could or should do.

                                                                  jms
