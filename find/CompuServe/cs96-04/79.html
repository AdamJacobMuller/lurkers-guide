<pre> Deonaha M. Conlin &lt;102531.2627@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; How can you possibly top this one?

      How can we top SD isn't the question.  It's when.  We *have* to
keep constantly getting better, improving the show.  As Bob Dylan
wrote, "Any man not busy being born is busy dying."

                                                                  jms
