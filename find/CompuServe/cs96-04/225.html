<pre> Tom Knudsen &lt;72347.1626@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Was there a reason why it was dropped?
&gt; Is it just because we don't see too many shots directly out that
&gt; window anymore or something else entirely?

      Actually, we did it once, in "Messages," but not much therafter.
The main reason is the cost of renting varilights, and the height of
our ceiling, which is somewhat lower than where we shot the pilot.

                                                                  jms
