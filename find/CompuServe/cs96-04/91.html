<H2>Universes: ST vs. B5</H2>
<h3>Date: 06-Apr-96 14:01:29</h3>
<pre> Rob Edin &lt;102623.2165@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; 5 stations, hmmm?

       Clarifications: B1-B3 were never finished, but sabotaged very
early in construction, so the cost impact wasn't that high.  Only B4
was completed. When it vanished, the project was almost abandoned, but
then the Minbari and Centauri agreed to help finance the project, and
the EA went ahead with a scaled-down version, their last shot at it. 
Hence, B5.

                                                                  jms
