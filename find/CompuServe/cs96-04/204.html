<pre> William H. DiPaola &lt;76521.1751@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; If PTEN really exists no longer, why would such an advertisement
&gt; be inserted when a B5 promo could be shown in its place just as
&gt; easily?

      No, the PTEN change wouldn't really take effect until after year
three, assuming that goes on as it seems to be.  This year is still
under the PTEN aegis, and thus the cross promotion is necessary.

                                                                  jms
