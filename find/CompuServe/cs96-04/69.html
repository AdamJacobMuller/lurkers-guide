<pre> William H. DiPaola &lt;76521.1751@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; So are you possibly indicating that G'Kar could have been seeing
&gt; a spirit as well?

      Well, G'Kar doubtless *thinks* he saw a spirit, possibly the
spirit of his father, possibly something else...revealed later as
G'Lan, of course, taking that image in order to give him a revelation.

                                                                  jms
