<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; How do they protect the station from damage caused by collisions
&gt; with debris, and do they even attempt to gather up the remains of
&gt; the dead floating around out there?

       We've shown clean-up crews before outside, including a hazmat
station that goes out to clear away fuel cores or other toxic material.
They would've been dispatched for this.

                                                                  jms
