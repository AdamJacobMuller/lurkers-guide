      I'm fine.  A little harried, tired and generally staggered these
days, but fine.  Spent the day at the hospital with Harlan today, who's
doing MUCH better, walking around, cracking jokes...a vast improvement.

      I'm still hip-deep in post production, and laying stuff out for
next year in hopes of renewal...but basically fine.

                                                                  jms
