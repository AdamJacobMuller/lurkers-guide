      Re: Foundation "adding a new flame effect"...sort of.  One
night, we just went out into the parking lot, set up a camera pointing
up behind a plexiglass screen, and set off a bunch of explosions above
it.  Went great until one of the blasts was so big it melted through
the plex *and* the camera lens....

      Looked good though, didn't it?

                                                                  jms
