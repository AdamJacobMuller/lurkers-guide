<pre> James R. Kapesis &lt;104154.27@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is there anything that you can do to get DC comics to start
&gt; publishing new B5 comics? Aren't you concerned that the story you
&gt; wrote for the first few issues may never be seen by your fans? If
&gt; you're having trouble with DC, why don't you just let another
&gt; company publish the comics?

      The comics may finally be getting back on line.  There will be a
meeting in May in NY to finalize stuff there.

      I will not, however, be writing directly for the comic anymore. 
DC has a policy that they will not allow writers final say on their
books.  Only the editors.  On all books written by other writers, as
per their contract with DC, I via WB, have final approval.  However, if
I function as a writer, then I must give up that right and allow myself
to be rewritten by the editor. It's a jurisdictional matter.  Suffice
to say I was appalled by some of the rewriting done on what I'd turned
in on the four issue arc.

      Consequently, I will not be writing that arc, or any other books
for the DC title.  I will be happy to provide information to keep the
story current with the series, farm out premises so it stays canon, and
work closely with the writers in my approval status.  That way I can
make sure the work is to our standards; if I write for the book, I
cannot do so, because the editor insists on rewriting me to maintain
DC's jurisdictional structure.

                                                                  jms
