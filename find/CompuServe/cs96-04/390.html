<pre> stoney truett &lt;71623.2377@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Do you know what MacGoohan is up to these days?
&gt; Could you clarify this?

      I don't know what he's doing these days, though happily
Braveheart seems to have brought him out of retirement.  He's simply
one of the best actors I've ever seen.

      We'd approached him in year one with a part, and things seemed
to be going well, until we were told he would be out of the country,
which nixed it. We'll get him yet.

                                                                   jms
