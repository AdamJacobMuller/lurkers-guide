<pre> Phil Koltko &lt;71604.2145@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; What holds people to the seats and floor of the core shuttle?

      There are mag-strips, also hand-holds, seat belts and
foot-straps.  As you enter you hear the voice warning that this is a
reduced gravity area, and to exercise proper precautions.

                                                                  jms
