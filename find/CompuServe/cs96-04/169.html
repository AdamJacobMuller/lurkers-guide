<pre> Randall A. Schanze &lt;74724.762@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is the show in great danger now, or did the story just happen to
&gt; be written at a time of some chaos, which has now passed?

      The article portrayed, and somewhat overstated, the events of
last year. (I take some of the blame for this; I may have spoken
unwisely in a few places.)

      The main problem overall right now, for *every* syndicated show,
is that the available time slots are just totally disappearing, thanks
to committments to WBN, UPN and Fox.  They just yanked Lonsesome Dove
even though the ratings were good, and the show was a good show, simply
because they couldn't find enough berths on independent stations to
make it worth it for the national advertisers.

      It's certainly a dark cloud on the horizon; we'll just have to
see whether it blows past harmlessly or not.

                                                                  jms
