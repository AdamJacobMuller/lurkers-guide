<H2>B5 FAN CLUB INFO!</H2>
<h3>Date: 11-Apr-96 18:48:20</h3>
<pre> Trent K. Johnson &lt;71020.1052@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; This is probably a no-brainer, Joe, but if WB has access to the
&gt; numbers for the fan club, a good response would also help
&gt; convince them the interest is there for videos, etc.?

      I don't know what it takes to get through on this issue,
frankly....

                                                                  jms
