<H2>&lt;Sic Transit Vir&gt;</H2>
<h3>Date: 21-Apr-96 15:34:08</h3>
<pre> Arline Williams &lt;102551.2346@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; What happened to Vir's pre-nuptial gift that his fiance so
&gt; lovingly offered to him to dispose of at his leisure?

      No, Vir would never kill a Narn, so he's fine.

                                                                  jms
