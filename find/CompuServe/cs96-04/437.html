<H2>Shadow defeat, 1st time?</H2>
<h3>Date: 29-Apr-96 18:05:23</h3>
<pre> Mark &lt;70004.1111@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; How were the shadows defeated the first time around?
&gt; telepaths involved also?

       Who can say...?

                                                                  jms
