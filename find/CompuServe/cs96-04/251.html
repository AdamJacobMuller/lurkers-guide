<pre> Al Lipscomb &lt;75204.2225@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I am wondering if we are going to see Bester as more of a good
&gt; guy? I am wondering if that is how I will look at B5 when it is
&gt; over and in reruns?

      Exactly, the older shows take on more substance, weight and
interest the more you've seen after them.  All kinds of stuff jumps out
at you after a while.  As for Bester...no matter what, it's fair to say
he's on nobody's side but his own.

                                                                  jms
