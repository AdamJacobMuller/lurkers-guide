<pre> Rebecca Eschliman &lt;76072.2345@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Because of the success of your anti-type casting, has there been
&gt; any kind of surge of actors wanting to be included in the B5
&gt; epic?

      No, not really...mainly because we're still not very visible to
most agents.

                                                                  jms
