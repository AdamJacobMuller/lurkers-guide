<H2>B5 FAN CLUB INFO!</H2>
<h3>Date: 10-Apr-96 00:20:28</h3>
<pre> Shane S. Shellenbarger &lt;104305.3404@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is there anything special being done for those of us who were
&gt; subscribers to the newsletter that Christy Marx edited?

      Yes, those individuals will receive the newsletter free of
charge even if they don't join the fan club, until such time as the
remaining 2 issues are worked off.

                                                                  jms
