<h3>Date: 09-Apr-96 02:43:14</h3>
<pre> Automedia, Inc. &lt;70530.2521@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; A quick question: Do you know why WB/PTEN isn't bothering to put
&gt; previews for the next new episode at the end of B5 anymore? What
&gt; gives?

       The space usually taken by the B5 preview is now being used up
by the WB B5 contest.

                                                                  jms
