<pre> Richard J De Lotto &lt;73353.1314@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; How do we sign up for the fan club?

Here's the info:

The Official Membership Kit includes:

     A Subscription to The Universe Today: The Official Newsletter of
the
     B5FC filled with exclusive interviews, news about Babylon 5, and
     exciting merchandise offers.
     An 8x10 Cast Photo
     Full Color Babylon 5 Mini-Poster (13"x20")
     B5 Fan Club Button &amp; Full Color Sticker
     Membership Certificate (Signed by the show's Executive Producers,

     Michael Straczynski and Douglas Netter)
     Membership ID Card granting you discounts on merchandise,
conventions,
     etc., as well as access to the Members Only section of
TheStation.com,
     the B5 Fan Club Web-site (to be up May 1996).
     Plus as a bonus, the first 100 people to join get:

     artist Peter Ledger.
================

To Give a Membership as a Gift, simply make a copy of the entry form,
fill in the name of the person you wish to make a member, and send it
off. (Don't forget to include your name on the Suggestions line, so
that we can include a gift card.)

Each year the Renewal Kit will offer new and different goodies,
savings, and of course another year's subscription to The Universe
Today.

Remember, this is more than just your run of the mill fan club; the
Babylon 5 fans time and time again have gone that extra step for the
show, and the Babylon 5 Fan Club is our way of giving something back to
those who've been so loyal to us.
