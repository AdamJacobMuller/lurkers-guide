<pre> Bruce "Firestorm" S. &lt;72571.1722@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Jms, do you know what was the reason for the sound limit imposed
&gt; by the FCC?

      I used to know...I think it had something to do with preventing
audio bleedovers, but I'm not 100% sure on that score.

                                                                  jms
