       Let me tell you about a certain kind of sickness.

       The sickness manifests itself in pathetic individuals who, in a
non-electronic forum, would be lighting cats on fire to watch them
howl, or throwing rocks through somebody's window to see them all run
out.

       A few very sad, very pathetic individuals who want to feel
alive come into a forum and leave a message written in insulting terms
because they like to watch everybody get all wired up.  They sit back
and giggle and laugh and wonder gee, whatever was it I said? when they
know exactly what they said.  It was done deliberately, to manipulate
people and get them upset.

       You have no interest in a "survey."  You're a sick, sad and
pathetic individual with nothing more in his life than the need to
tweak people who follow a show that for whatever disturbed reason you
feel should be attacked in the name of Star Trek, even though that
means violating every principle of tolerance ever advanced in ST.

       Some here will probably tell you to get a life.  I would
suggest that you have a life...unfortunately, it consists of the kind
of life where one spends one's time pulling the wings off flies because
you like to see them squirm around on the table.

       And most pathetically, you've probably never even watched the
show, to bolster your opinion.  Maybe a minute or two here and there. 
But getting the facts doesn't matter.  Getting people's opinions
doesn't matter to you, really.  Just causing a flurry of angry messages
and upsetting people is all that really matters to you.

                                                                  jms
