      It's okay...so are most of the women who work in the editing
bays at B5. The first few days of this season, as his stuff started
coming in, one of them pulled me aside, and with hand firmly on my arm,
to let me know she meant business, said, "Listen very carefully: I want
to see a LOT more of Marcus."
