<pre> James R. Kapesis &lt;104154.27@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is this true?
&gt; If so, why did you want Londo to be played by a puppet?

   I've wracked my brain trying to remember if that's true or not, and
I honestly can't remember ever having a discussion about Londo being a
puppet. Prosthetics, yes, but not anything animatronic.

                                                                  jms
