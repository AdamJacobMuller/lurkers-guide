"do you run your scrips by others?  IOW, do you make sure that it will
all make sense to others?"

      You must understand several things.  First, there's no one else
on a writing side to *run* things past here.  There's just me.  I *am*
the writing staff this season (which will probably not be quite the
same next season, if I can find the right people).

      The other thing is that writing is really a solitary business. 
There's the impression that in TV, stories get whomped around and
mushed up by some faceless committee.  While this is true in some
cases, it isn't true in all cases.  David Kelley's scripts are his
scripts.  Steve Bochco's scripts are his scripts.  My scripts are my
scripts.  If I don't know my craft well enough to know whether or not
it'll make sense to others, I should get out of the business
immediately.

      As soon as I finish writing the script, alone, it goes right
into production.

                                                                  jms
