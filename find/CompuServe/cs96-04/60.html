<H2>Dust to Dust Problem</H2>
<h3>Date: 04-Apr-96 22:25:34</h3>
<pre> James R. Kapesis &lt;104154.27@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; In "Dust to Dust" why did you have G'Kar refer to his father in
&gt; the third person when he said "I must honor my father's name" to
&gt; his father? Also why wasn't G'Kar happy and embracing his father
&gt; when he appeared to him right after G'Kar watched his father die
&gt; hanging from the tree?

      Both questions have the same answer: logically, G'Kar knows that
his father is dead.  He saw him die.  So whoever this was, wasn't his
father, even though he was appearing that way.  Or was a spirit, and
either way, he would've been sufficiently apprehensive about it not to
go blithely around embracing something he didn't understand.  I sure as
hell wouldn't.

                                                                  jms
