<H2>Earth Gov Question</H2>
<h3>Date: 10-Apr-96 16:13:56</h3>
<pre> Bruno Melancon &lt;102647.3222@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Does Earth still have different nations/states with
&gt; presidents/prime ministers and so on, under rules from the Earth
&gt; Alliance gov., with its own Senate and President? Are the EA
&gt; senators and president elected by all earth population?

      Each nation/state elects a leader, and that leader is either one
of the Earthgov senators, in the case of a smaller nation, or appoints
a rep to be on that body.

                                                                  jms
