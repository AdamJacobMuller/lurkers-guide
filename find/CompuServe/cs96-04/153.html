       Thanks.  I was kind of afraid that after the big Stuff Blowing
Up Episode, anything afterward would be a let down because it couldn't
have the same level of huge action (without killing everyone making the
show).  So the way to deal with that is to go in an entirely different
direction; I was hoping that'd work, and glad that so far it has.

                                                                  jms
