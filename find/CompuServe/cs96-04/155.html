<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Another thing I was wondering about was, how long is an act in
&gt; viewing time? What is considered an act?

       An act is a discrete dramatic unit separated by commercials
front and back.  An act can be anywhere from 6-11 minutes as a rule;
act 4 of SD was about 8:20, as I recall.

                                                                  jms
