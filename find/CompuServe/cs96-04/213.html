      No, I didn't see or intend any element of Lennier being racist;
but there are definitely differences in culture and physiology between
Minbari and humans.  Minbari are very careful about personal space, and
they don't like to be talked to a certain way.  Marcus momentarily
forgot himself, and acted inappropriately.  Lennier corrected him.

                                                                  jms
