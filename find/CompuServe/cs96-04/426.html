<pre> Daniel M. Upton &lt;75442.1331@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Who built it?
&gt; The Rangers or technicians on the B5 payroll?
&gt; Also, how much have the former Earth Force personel stationed on
&gt; B5 been told about the Shadows and the coming war?

      Thanks.  Yes, everybody's agendas remain the same...but for the
moment, they are on the same alignment.  As soon as it's over, as
Ivanova says, he'll turn on them, no mistake.  Enlightened
self-interest, nothing more.

      The new command center was cobbled from what's on the station,
with some additional Minbari funding.  And yes, by now, pretty much the
whole crew knows what's at stake with the shadows.  And now that
they're not hiding anymore, the whole *thing* is out in the open.

                                                                  jms
