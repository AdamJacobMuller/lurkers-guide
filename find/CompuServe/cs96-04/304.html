<pre> Marte Brengle &lt;76703.4242@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; That was a real scar?
&gt; When was Don Stroud so severely injured?

       Yes, the scar is real.  He had some rough times a few years
ago. (Actually, he also appeared with the scar as it's seen here in
"TKO," as Garibaldi's corner man, though there it was hidden a bit.) 
He's still doing a lot of work though.

       (The funny thing was seeing the occasional comment on the nets
saying how fake they thought the makeup looked, and why couldn't we
manage to do something a bit more realistic looking?)

                                                                  jms
