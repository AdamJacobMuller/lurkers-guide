<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Tell me, is Peter's accent real?
&gt; Were you involved with the hiring of the actors?
&gt; Did you know their previous work or did they audition fpr their
&gt; parts?

      No, Peter's accent isn't real, though he does a good job with
it.  And yes, I hire (with Doug Netter and John Copeland) all the
actors on the show.

                                                                  jms
