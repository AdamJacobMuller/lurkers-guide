       "...telepathy, telekinesis, prophesy..."

       Basically, I wouldn't consider those technology in any form. 
The technology on which the *show* is based is pretty
rigorous...starfuries designed for zero gravity, a dyson-style sphere,
rotational gravity, and so on.

                                                                  jms
