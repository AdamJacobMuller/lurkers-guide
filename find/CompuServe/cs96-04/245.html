<pre> Thomas Zahler &lt;74041.2514@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; But (and seeing John's father listed in the opening credits made
&gt; me think about this) did you rework this to be Sheridan's wife? Or
&gt; is this a plotline that we will never see happen?

      No, the b-story about Sinclair's brother was never intended to
be the Anna Sheridan thing, since obviously the reference was to his
brother still being alive.

      I never just transfer stories from A to B; each character has to
have his or her own individual arc, specific to who that person is. 
Bits and pieces get moved around, or reassigned, but not generally that
blatantly.

                                                                  jms
