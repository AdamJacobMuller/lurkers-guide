<pre> Rebecca Eschliman &lt;76072.2345@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Was she able to use the pain to confirm a sense of her own
&gt; rebirth?

      Yes, I think Mira was able to draw upon her background a lot in
this one.

      I also like the look between Marcus and Delenn as they stand in
the customs area...he looks like he desperately wants to say more, and
she like she desperately wants to hear it...but he turns and walks
away, the moment lost.

                                                                  jms
