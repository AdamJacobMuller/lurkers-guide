<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Is Vir married?
&gt; What is that patch on the right shoulder of the new uniforms?

      At this point, with the rethinking going on back home, he's
bethrothed and promised, the marriage arranged, but not yet fully,
*formally* married. There's still ritual to go through.  The other
family could still choose to withdraw the arrangement.

      One of the patches is a Ranger patch; the other is the new B5
sword and shield logo.

      (BTW, on your web site, could you possibly withhold the synopses
 -- which are provided to the stations, and not intended for general
release -- until a little closer to the episode's airdate?  A couple of
those you've released have caused a fair amount of consternation, and
destroyed some of the impact I'd wanted with those episodes.  There's
nothing I can do to stop you from posting the information -- though
starting with "War" 2 I'm now personally editing the synopses to delete
some stuff -- but if you could just hold back even a little, it would
help me a lot.)

                                                                  jms
