<pre> Joe Salemi [ZD Net] &lt;72631.23@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; And Mira?
&gt; And the look in her eyes?

      Thanks, and yes, there's definitely fire and steel in Delenn,
which she calls upon when she needs it.  And nobody crosses her when
that happens.

                                                                   jms
