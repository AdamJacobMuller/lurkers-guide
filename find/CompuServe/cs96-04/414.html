<H2>&lt;Actor's reaction?&gt;</H2>
<h3>Date: 27-Apr-96 22:37:37</h3>
<pre> Joe Salemi [ZD Net] &lt;72631.23@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Now that the actors have finished filming season 3, and are 9
&gt; episodes ahead of us, can you tell us what their reaction is to
&gt; the changes you've wrought?

      Well, most of the actors have split now that filming's over for
the season, scattering to the four winds...but I'd say overall that
they're all very pleased at how their characters have been changed,
what's happened, and seeing how it's been *massively* cranked up for
next season.

                                                                  jms
