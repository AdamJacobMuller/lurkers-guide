      Real simple.  For starters, both Senators are on the Babylon 5
Oversight Committee, and the CO of B5 is answerable to that committee,
as those in the Pentagon are answerable to the senate for senate-funded
activities.  Also, the matters in question, such as the labor strike,
were not strictly military matters, but *civilian* situations.

                                                                  jms
