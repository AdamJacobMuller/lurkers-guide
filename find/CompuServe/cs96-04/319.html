<pre> Jonathan Hoopingarn &lt;73172.1065@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Since it's been established that some species use crystals as
&gt; part of their technology for data storage as well as other
&gt; things, is this pendant some sort of Shadow technology or does it
&gt; have some other sort of significance in his relationship to the
&gt; Shadows?

      It may have its uses.

                                                                  jms
