<pre> Philip Hornsey &lt;74053.2101@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; What is B5's status vis-a-vis people coming and going there from
&gt; Earth? If I wanted to go from Earth to B5 what would I have to do?
&gt; Vise-versa, if I wanted to go home to Earth (after the
&gt; deportations were over) could I get a direct fliight and how
&gt; would I be received?

      It's very difficult now; you have to go through secondary
routes, and travel papers take forever to get processed.

      We'll actually mention this aspect later in the season.

                                                                  jms
