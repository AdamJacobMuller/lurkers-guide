<pre> Paul Frazier &lt;103311.567@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; al., turn off the jump gate prior to the arrival of the EA
&gt; vessels? And a related question: why did the EA ships use the jump
&gt; gate? What am I missing here?

       The answer to both your questions is about the same.  It takes
about a day to power down, or power up a jump gate.  It operates more
like a fusion reactor than a light bulb.  So not only wasn't there
enough time, even if they *had* had enough time, you'd want to leave
the gate up and running in case you needed to evacuate for any reason;
otherwise you'd cut off your main escape route.

       For the incoming fleet, knowing the gate was active was the way
to go, since it would let them launch their fighters prior to coming
in; if you use a jump point, you kinda have to launch while you're
coming out to avoid anyone being stuck behind.

                                                                  jms
