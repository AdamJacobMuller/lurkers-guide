<pre> Philip Hornsey &lt;74053.2101@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Did some of the Military follow Delenn?
&gt; May we assume that Neroon did not follow Delenn?

       No, 5 left the council with her.  And one can wonder, Did she
turn down the position of leader of the Grey Council, which would be a
balance for that role, in order to eliminate the council and become
primary ruler? (That is what some of the warrior caste are bound to
begin wondering after a while.)

                                                                  jms
