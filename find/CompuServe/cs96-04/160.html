<H2>B5 Supportability Issues</H2>
<h3>Date: 08-Apr-96 18:53:54</h3>
<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Now that they are cut off from Earth, how will they support
&gt; themselves? How will they support these?
&gt; By the way, how do they get back into the station?

       Fighters re-enter via the main docking bay and are recharged
and lowered into the fighter bays.

       No question, spare parts would be a problem, and they'll have
to cannibalize a lot (plus whatever they scrounged up from the fighters
blown apart outside).

                                                                  jms
