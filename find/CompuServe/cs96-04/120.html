      "JMS is on an anti-typcasting crusade."

      That's actually true, in a lot of ways.  My sense is that here
we have many actors who created enduring works because they were good
at what they did; they're *good actors*.  But because they were so good
at it, they got typecast as only able to play that.  How many people
snickered, wrongly, when they heard Walter was going to be Bester? 
"Chekhov in the Psi Corps," was the usual lament.

      Until they *saw* him.  And saw what he could do.

      To work against the typecasting is simply payment on a debt to
those who created enduring characters.  And I'll continue to do it
wherever and whenever I can.  (Look for Robert England in an upcoming
episode playing a very different sort of character than he's played
elsewhere lately.)

                                                                  jms
