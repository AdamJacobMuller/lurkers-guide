      Thanks.  I'm doing a lot to deepen up Marcus and Lennier, to let
people see parts of them we might not have seen before.  Everyone grows
on the show; even at this point, compare Lennier to the wide-eyed
innocent who first arrived at the station and couldn't even bring
himself to look Delenn in the eyes.

      Actually, no, the computer voice, Sparky, wasn't really a nod of
any kind to Hitchhiker's.  (And 2001's HAL beat them to the punch a
long time before that in any event.)  No, I just figured, if the
computer system had a glitch, what would it sound like? 
Answer...Harlan.
