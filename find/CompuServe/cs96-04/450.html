      No, apparently the rights negotations between the production
company and the apparent rights owner (First) ran into unresolved
rights questions from Ostrander, who says *he* has the rights...and now
it'll have to go into arbitration.  Since it'll take 90 days to
conclude that arbitration, that'll eat up my window of opportunity to
do the script before B5 would get going for year four...so it'll have
to wait at least a year now.

                                                                  jms
