       We'd booked the actor long, long in advance.  At the last
minute, he bailed to do a DS9 episode playing, essentially, the same
character, despite our having first dibs.

       So I killed off the character.  Didn't change the story by the
smallest measure.  May actually have helped, since it raised the stakes
in the story right from the start.

       Rule #1: Never honk off the writer.

                                                                  jms
