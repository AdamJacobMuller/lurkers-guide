<h3>Date: 11-Apr-96 00:21:30</h3>
<pre> Jack Beckman &lt;73227.3066@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Letdown?
&gt; Would this have been one of his chances to redeem himself(don't
&gt; have the prophosy text handy)?

      I don't think Londo feels he needs to be redeemed; his reasons
as stated were quite sincere.

      And thanks.

                                                                  jms
