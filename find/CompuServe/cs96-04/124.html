<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Is there a reason she wanted Sheridan's part in the Conspiracy of
&gt; Light kept under wraps, but expected something very different
&gt; from the Grey Council? Wouldn't that have jeopardized the chances
&gt; for success for the Conspiracy of Light? Secondly, I'm curious as
&gt; to whether the three Minbari warships are the sum of the fleet
&gt; the Religious and Worker Castes have at their disposal? Anybody
&gt; ever tell you your stories are addictive? ?

      Thanks.  The Grey Council could've taken a lot more action to be
supportive behind the scenes, getting the warrior caste more involved
with the rangers, giving aid to the non-aligned worlds...there was a
LOT they could have been doing all this time that wouldn't have
required tipping their hand. Instead they sat and did nothing.  And
now, with B5 on the edge of falling, to say it's not their problem was
too much.  Now is the time they have to start coming forward.

                                                                  jms
