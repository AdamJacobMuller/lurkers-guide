<pre> Randall A. Schanze &lt;74724.762@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I think I was assuming something along these lines: Originaly you
&gt; had Sinclair as the lead character for the whole 5 years, right? 
&gt; PS- officialy, whatever happened to Na'toth and Lou Welch?

      We'll be mentioning Na'Toth later this season.

      Actually, the relationship with Sinclair and Delenn wasn't
designed to be romantic; he was involved with Sakai, and would've
stayed that way for the most part.  The relationship you saw is not
quite what you're thinking; there is a closeness, but not based on
romantic feelings.  You'll catch a sense of what's behind this more
later this season.

                                                                  jms
