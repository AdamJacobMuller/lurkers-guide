<pre> Al Lipscomb &lt;75204.2225@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; With the station rotating for the simulation of gravity, and the
&gt; breaching pod attaching to to outside of the station: Should the
&gt; opening the pod mad have been in the floor instead of the wall?

      Yes and no.  They came through the "floor" which would be the
outer hull.  Like any good ship, the station has two hulls for
protection, an inner hull and an outer hull.  Once breaching the outer
hull, they moved into the inner hull, then angled up for a wall they
could blow out.

      I figured this would make more tactical sense because if they
just blew through the floor, they'd have to *crawl* out one or two at a
time, whereas if they angled in safely and then came in through a wall,
they could pour in more quickly, en masse, and be less vulnerable.

                                                                  jms
