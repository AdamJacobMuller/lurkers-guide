<H2>Renewal or not?</H2>
<h3>Date: 23-Apr-96 15:20:50</h3>
<pre> Mihai Farcas &lt;103346.2717@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Can we all chill out and await a reliable reply - like from JMS?

       I've said it a dozen times...*no one will know anything until
the early part of May at the SOONEST*.  The people who make the
decision aren't scheduled to have their meeting to START discussing it
until then.

       So ANYthing you hear, either way, on this from anyone prior to
that time is simply unsubstantiated rumor and can be dismissed.

       We remain cautiously optimistic.

                                                                  jms
