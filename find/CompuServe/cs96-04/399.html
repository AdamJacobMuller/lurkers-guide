       Thanks.  Yes, the Delenn/Arthur moment played out very well; no
lines, not a word, just the images, and the emotions under the surface.

       And thanks on the titles.  I often labor a long time on these
things, to try and give them many layers, or turn the title in on
itself, or do a play on words.  I can't start work on a script until I
have a title, because the title sets the mood.

                                                                  jms
