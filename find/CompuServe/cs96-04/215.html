      Unfortunately, we're not set up at the time to take credit
cards; we're a small operation.  Also, we had a number of folks ask for
the regular mail route for overseas vs. airmail because they wanted to
keep the cost factor down.  So we're kinda caught between a rock and a
hard place here.

                                                                   jms
