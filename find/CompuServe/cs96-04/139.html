       I hope nobody takes this the wrong way....but I think some of
the earlier slowness in the first season episodes has something to do
with being ST-programmed.  It's a pacing we've all kind of gotten used
to, lots of standing around and discussing stuff, and for everyone
concerned, particularly the freelancers, it's a *very* hard mindset to
break.  It took a while to work that out of everyone's system so we
could concentrate on telling a story the way only we can.

       Also, bear in mind that the first season or so we had to spend
a lot of time establishing our universe, the politics, history and so
on, so that the events we're seeing now would have some weight.  Now
that we've done all that, laid the foundation, we can just rip along at
top speed.

                                                                  jms
