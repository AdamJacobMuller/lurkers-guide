<H2>B5 FAN CLUB INFO!</H2>
<h3>Date: 23-Apr-96 15:16:02</h3>
<pre> Toby Johnson &lt;104305.1442@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Have you any information on how many people have joined the fan
&gt; club so far?? Also what % is US and what % is outside the US?
&gt; Are the numbers what you expected higher/lower??

       Right now, without any advertising of note, mainly word of
mouth, we've got over 2,000 members so far.  We're adding about 150 per
day.

                                                                  jms
