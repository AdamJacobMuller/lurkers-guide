<pre> Toni Muller &lt;75223.1575@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; _Why_ is she doing this?
&gt; And what will Sheridan's reaction be if and when he finds out?
&gt; Also, when you said we'll see Anna soon but not in this batch of
&gt; episodes, did you mean we'll see her at least by the end of this
&gt; season?

       I'm in the awful situation of not being able to answer either
of those questions without giving away something major.  All I can say
is that Delenn has good reasons, or what she thinks are good reasons.

                                                                  jms
