<pre> Philip Hornsey &lt;74053.2101@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Was this a member of the Warrior Caste defecting with Delenn?
&gt; Who the hell is running the Mimbari government now?
&gt; Incedently, if the warrior caste was *not* in on it, where did
&gt; they get the warships?

       At this point, with the Council broken, Delenn isn't currently
running Minbar...there's a vacuum of power.  The system can carry on
for a while, the balance between the castes is pretty efficient, but
this is going to have to be resolved, and some in the warrior caste may
suspect Delenn of doing this so she *can* rise to power.

       As part of Valen's covenant, to prevent one caste from taking
over the other, each caste has access to its own warships.  This was
done to create trust a thousand years ago, and since then, since there
hasn't been any conflict between Minbari, the three castes own their
own warships still, but in general are assigned to Warrior caste as a
courtesy, which can be revoked. As Delenn noted, the worker and
religious castes control 2/3rds of their forces.

                                                                  jms
