       Yes, the Thunderbolt furies were seen both on Mars and
attacking B5.

       A normal Starfury can't function in an atmosphere environment. 
The new Thunderbolt models have airfoils/wings that are folded back
over the body of the ship for non-atmospheric maneuvering, and then
extend out to full sized wings when entering an atmosphere.  (You'll
get to see in detail how this works back and forth in "Ship of Tears.")

                                                                  jms
