<pre>      Question: if one were to go to dinner in San Francisco, and one
wanted to go somewhere *very* nice, very tony, upscale, with *terrific*
food, maybe a view of the bay or something equally spiffy, no loud
music, something very comfortable, no pushy waiters...what would be the
best place in town?  (It preferably doesn't require reservations weeks
in advance.)

      Follow up: if afterward one wanted to go to a great part of town
for a cup of coffee, with little interesting shops in the area, or in a
pretty part of town...what would one suggest?

      Thanks.

                                                                  jms
