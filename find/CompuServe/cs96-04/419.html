      Not the work per se in terms of being influenced, but the
attitude that goes into the work, yes.  I've stood at Stonehenge at
dawn, the place more or less empty, walked along the circular stones at
Avebury, and stood in the deep cavernous center of a pre-bronze age
burial mound in Ireland...when you do these things, you begin to
understand what *time* is, and how we in this country don't really know
what that is yet.  It can affect how you perceive a lot of things, and
in the end, that always feeds back into the writing.

                                                                  jms
