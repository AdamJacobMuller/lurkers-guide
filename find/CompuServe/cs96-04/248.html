      No, the .avi files work in tandem with another file, to make it
work. You'll note that shpdta08.avi comes alongside shpdta09.dat (or
some other extension), which contains the info.  If you install it from
the disk, it usually works fine.  The scrittching sound on the
personnel data is the identicard scanner sound, which goes with the
identicard readout.

                                                                   jms
