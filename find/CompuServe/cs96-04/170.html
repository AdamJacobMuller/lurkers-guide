<H2>B5 Cancellation RUMOR</H2>

<pre>{original post had no questions}

      Okay, Horse's Mouth time.

      We have not, repeat, not been canceled.  Right now, WB has
bought covers of newspaper TV magazines in over 80 cities that'll debut
over the next couple of weeks; they've also invested a huge amount of
money in a series of radio and TV spots that'll be airing on cable and
indie stations over the next 6 weeks.  They're currently running the B5
contest.  Several stations have announced that they're going to go back
to double-running B5 twice a week.

      Do you think they would do this for a show that's been canceled?

      They don't.  They cut their losses and run like hell.

      This is a jumble of information.  Yes, PTEN seems to be going
away; I've been saying this on the nets for the last several months,
and that we're going to move into straight syndication.  Someone has
apparently taken this and blown it all out of proportion.

      Every season, somebody announces that they've heard it on
absolutely firm grounds that we've been canceled.  Hasn't happened yet.
We've had our ups and downs, like any other show, but we're still here.

                                                                  jms
