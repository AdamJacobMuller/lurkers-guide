<h3>Date: 17-Apr-96 01:46:29</h3>
<pre> Tom Knudsen &lt;72347.1626@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Was Star Wars unoriginal because Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon
&gt; preceded it? Was Hill Street Blues unoriginal because about 200
&gt; other police shows preceded it? Is ER unoriginal because it's the
&gt; umpteenth hospital show ever made?

      In considering ST to be totally original, obviously he's never
heard of Forbidden Planet....

                                                                  jms
