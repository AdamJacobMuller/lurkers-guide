<pre> Bill Hirst &lt;104106.431@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is it just that you genuinely enjoy chatting about your show
&gt; enough to take the negative comments along with the praise? BTW,
&gt; how are the wrists doing?

       Why?  Why not?

       I was on CIS and GEnie long before B5 got going.  I figured,
why change my habits just because now I was supposedly a vip?  (And I'm
not always comfortable with that designation.)

       Beyond that, my job as a writer is to know as much as I can
about my characters and universe.  In answering all these questions, I
learn more about those areas, which helps me.

       Finally, it's a matter of being accessible and *accountable* to
fans, as I'd wished producers had been when I was primarily a viewer. 
SF fans are generally the most exploited sorts of fans...you're told to
line up, watch the show, buy the merchandise, and shut up.  I didn't
like it then, and I don't like it any better now that I'm on the other
side of the lens.

                                                                  jms
