<pre> David Scarpa &lt;73672.2136@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Joe , in one of the early eps there is a shadowery figure I think
&gt; there was some hidden group called Controll 11 or something what
&gt; ever happened to these individuals and is hat a dropped thread or
&gt; one that will come up again ?

      The Bureau was incorporated into other parts of the government.

                                                                  jms
