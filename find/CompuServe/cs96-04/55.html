<pre> Phil Koltko &lt;71604.2145@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Joe, What about Gerrold writing a novel?
&gt; Can this be done?

      It can be done, sure, but I think David is generally more
interested in writing his own novels than a farmed-out concept book,
and rightly so.

                                                                  jms
