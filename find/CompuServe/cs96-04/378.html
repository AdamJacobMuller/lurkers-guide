<pre> David Belt &lt;72142.1365@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Could you tell us what the line would have been about the
&gt; bound-up Narn?

       No, the only line was that "the Narn is recovering in Medlab,"
something to that effect.  Sigh....

                                                                  jms
