      You can see explosive bolts going off, and a series of small
thrusters behind the cockpit area which allow for navigation.  This
gets the pilot away from the main body which has either been crippled,
or is about to explode, the same way a modern fighter has an ejection
system.  (Check the main credit sequence for a better shot of an
ejection.)
