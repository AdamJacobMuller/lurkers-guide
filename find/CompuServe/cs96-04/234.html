      Maybe.  You must understand I'm speaking fairly close to being a
layman at this stuff.  All I know is that when I look at what I get on
cable, and what I get on the DSS, the difference is *startling*, and I
haven't ever noticed any "artifacting."  My feeling is, if I can't see
it, it doesn't bother me.

                                                                  jms
