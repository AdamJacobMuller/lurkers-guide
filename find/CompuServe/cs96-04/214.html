<pre> Salvador Bravo &lt;103121.2770@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I'm into collecting model starships, and I was wondering if there
&gt; was a chance that the station as well as the rest of starships in
&gt; the B5 universe will be available for purchase any time soon?!

      Thank you.  I'm glad you've stayed with it.  There will probably
be models at some point down the road; right now the only models are
illegal ones.  I want a B5 model myself, frankly.

      Of course, I'd like mine on a 1-1 scale....

                                                                  jms
