<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Did you notice Henry Briscoe's comment to me, yesterday?

      No, I agree, that a serious inquiry can merit good responses
that lead to the person checking out the show.  It's just when somebody
comes in and demands or tells you to "defend" the show, I've never yet
seen a situation where the person had any interest in the answer...they
just like to see people have to defend themselves on that which does
not require defense.

      I've been on the nets 15 years...I know all the routines by
heart.

                                                                   jms
