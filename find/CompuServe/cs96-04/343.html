<pre> Arwel Parry &lt;100336.623@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I assume you withdrew TFON to avoid splitting the vote?

      Thanks.  Yes, since the last time we were in Hugo contention,
the splitting of votes cost us the award (combined votes would've been
enough going in to win), the folks gave us the option of withdrawing
one of the two, and since "The Coming of Shadows" seems the overall
favorite, that one was the one kept.

      One other good thing about the withdrawl of one episode was that
it allowed Terry Gilliam's "12 Monkeys" onto the ballot, which
otherwise would've been frozen out, and it deserves the recognition of
the nomination.

      We're all *very* pleased and excited by the nomination.

                                                                  jms
