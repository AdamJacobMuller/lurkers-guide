<H2>JMS Fav B5 CD Track?</H2>
<h3>Date: 15-Apr-96 23:57:26</h3>
<pre> Matt Allen &lt;100530.232@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Joe which is your favorite track on the B5 CD?
&gt; Is this your favorite track as a remix of it is now the third
&gt; season main theme? Do you ever play the CD while writing/relaxing
&gt; or driving etc?

      Yeah, I'd say the extended "Requiem" piece on the CD is probably
my favorite.

                                                                  jms
