<pre> Philip Hornsey &lt;74053.2101@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Also, given that Ivannova had *finally* found someone to be close
&gt; to, it it just her fate to get screwed by Psi Corps?

      No, people get involved with other people for any number of
reasons; it's not necessarily any easier to stay within one's gender
with teeps.

                                                                  jms
