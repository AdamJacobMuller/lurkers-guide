<pre> Michael Grabois &lt;74737.2600@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Who was supposed to have said it?

      It was in the observation dome scene with Ivanova; I realized
that we'd cut a small piece for time that was expendable, but in the
back and forth went one line too far without realizing it.  Sigh....

                                                                  jms
