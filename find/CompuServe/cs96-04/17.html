<H2>Time on B5</H2>
<h3>Date: 02-Apr-96 19:16:02</h3>
<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Isn't B5 a group effort of many worlds?
&gt; Why should Earth dominate?

       Nope.  B5 is not "a group effort of many worlds."  The Earth
Alliance funded the construction on all the Babylon stations, accepting
a little extra money from the Minbari and the Centauri toward the end
to help finish B5.  The currency is regulated in terms of Earth
credits, the laws in the Ombuds courtroom are Earth laws (except as
they encounter cultural laws between members of the same species), it's
Earth Alliance Station Babylon 5, and so on.  Is it fair?  Probably
not.  But that's how Earth wants it, and Earth runs, finances, oversees
and built B5.

                                                                  jms
