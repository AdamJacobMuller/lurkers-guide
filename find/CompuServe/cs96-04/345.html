<H2>New B5 Card Set in 8/96!</H2>

      Just a quick public statement of support for the cards.  The
last batch were very good -- even ending up on some magazines' lists of
Top Ten Cards for the year -- and all indications are that this one
will be even better. Of all the things I'm asked to sign at
conventions, probably the #1 items are cards from the Fleer set (ditto
for many of the cast).  I'm definitely looking forward to seeing them.

                                                                  jms
