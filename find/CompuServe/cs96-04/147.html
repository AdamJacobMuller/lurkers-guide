<pre> Philip Hornsey &lt;74053.2101@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Did you ever actually write for "V" other than the script posted
&gt; here?

       No, I had no involvement in V2 (which is simultaneously and
appropriately the term for the series, and the German rocket-bomb that
plagued Britain).  I just knew of Robert's work in general.

                                                                  jms
