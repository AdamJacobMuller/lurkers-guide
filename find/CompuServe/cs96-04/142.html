<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Who is loyal and who is traitor?

       Actually, yes, I tend to ask for musical counterpoint in the
show from time to time.  For instance, when Sheridan et al were going
to the area where the crowd was waiting, I told Chris to fool us...give
us an ominous sounding sting going into what's going to be a very "up"
scene.  In the battle earlier on, when you'd normally do something fast
and exciting, I asked him to give me something more somber, to pull out
the Requiem theme in a few places. Sometimes, in other shows, I ask for
music that works against a scene to control the emotional core of it;
if it's a bit too silly, perhaps, then I go for a more serious musical
cue to balance it out.  Where a scene would seem to ask for major keys,
I go for minor chords.

       It's all just part of the tapestry.

       (BTW, a little secret...just for fun, I wrote a couple of songs
that you'll be hearing in an upcoming episode.  I used to write songs
here and there, even did a couple for an ABC prime-time special, and
figured I'd try it again.  I wrote the lyrics, discussed the music with
Chris, and he took care of the score, and it's about what I first
conceived.  Came out pretty well, actually.)

                                                                  jms
