&gt; I'm not repressed any more.") You have fun writing for him, don't
&gt; you?

      I love writing for Marcus.  I can just come at the dialoge from
a completely different angle.  There's a certain edge, a dark kind of
irony that comes through his character that lets me do lines I can't do
for anyone else except sometimes Ivanova.  He's a hoot....

                                                                  jms
