&gt; Obviously, JMS has had to make a lot of rather fluid changes to
&gt; the b5 "Grand Arc" to adjust to cast changes and so on, right? 
&gt; Opinions?

      No, the "romance angles" aren't "late additions," but you don't
just leap into a romance right off.  You couldn't have had the
Delenn/Sheridan thing right in the beginning of year two, it had to be
built, and grow gradually.  Things are introduced as it is time for
them to be introduced. The shadows weren't even named until season two,
and didn't make their first appearance until late in season one.  Is
that a late addition?

      To your other points...a commanding officer needs a second, it's
that simple.  So it's not so much recasting the same part as filling
what's required in a military role.  Draal--Drall2 isn't a different
character, it's the same character.  Also, Lou Welch wasn't Garibaldi's
second in command, that was the guy who shot him.  He goes away, now
you need a new second who is a very different character.

      In real life, things change.  What I *like* about B5 is that
people come and go, the credits aren't the same from year to year. 
Otherwise you end up in a situation like folks complained about on TNG
where Riker didn't get a decent promotion in 7 years.

                                                                  jms
