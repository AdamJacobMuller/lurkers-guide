<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Do you see this as likely?

      Yes, I think it's very likely that's one reason we're more or
less frozen out of a lot of areas.  I've seen it happen.  I used to be
a reviewer (not a critic, I'm not that smart), and hung out with
others; the theaters or producers with whom they had a relationship,
they covered; those with whom they didn't, didn't get covered.

      But then, as was pointed out to me a while back, critics are
paid to be unfair, so you can't let it bother you.

                                                                  jms
