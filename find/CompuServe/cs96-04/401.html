       Thanks.  I guess I'm just kinda hard on my own stuff.  DN was
the first novel I'd ever written, and it was a learning experience.  I
came out of it better able to do the next one, and there are any number
of ways I'd go back and improve the first book.  Ah, well...as someone
once noted, "Art is never finished, only abandoned."

                                                                  jms
