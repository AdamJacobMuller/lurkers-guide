<H2>B5 FAN CLUB INFO!</H2>
<h3>Date: 09-Apr-96 17:58:09</h3>
<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Is there any chance that the fan club will start accepting credit
&gt; cards?

       Unfortunately, we're a small operation, and not yet set up for
credit cards.  With luck, we'll eventually be set up that way.  (Once
the web site is up and running, it's our hope to have it credit card
ready, so you could perhaps wait for that if it's a burden for now.  It
should be up within about a month.)

                                                                  jms
