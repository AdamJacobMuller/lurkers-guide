       "I tried to give people a motive to send their vote to me."

       You could have accomplished exactly the same thing by just
asking. And I'm sorry, when someone calls a show a "cheap knockoff,"
and derides those who might actually watch it, it makes your statement
that you "did not intend to offend" rather...unbelievable, at best.

                                                                  jms
