      Yes, Londo is a very sharp, cunning character.  He does what he
does for sheer patriotism, to serve his people.  *Whatever* that may
entail.  And Vir gets whipsawed a lot...he's a great character, with a
wide range of characteristics I can play with, from comic to tragic.

                                                                  jms
