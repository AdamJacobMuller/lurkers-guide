      Easy.  Takashima would have been the one to be Control.  A Psi
Corps plant.  (Her background on Mars would've been the perfect time
for it to have happened.)  When Laurel went away, I took that one
thread and passed it along to Talia, setting it up as early as the very
first episode, when Talia and Ivanova first meet, and later reluctantly
have a drink.

      At one point, Ivanova says to Talia, referencing Ivanova's
mother, "You're as much of a victim as she was."  To which Talia
replies, "I don't feel like a victim."  And, of course, that's exactly
what she was, though she didn't know it yet.  Ivanova's analysis was
100% correct.

                                                                  jms
