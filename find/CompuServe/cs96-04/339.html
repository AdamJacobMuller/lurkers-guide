<pre> Robin L. Small &lt;76640.2012@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Why??

      Yes, the intros are spoken in the past tense.

      But when is it in the story that they are spoken....hmmmm....?

      In theory, one could speak of 2258 in 2259 and it's the past
tense.

                                                                  jms
