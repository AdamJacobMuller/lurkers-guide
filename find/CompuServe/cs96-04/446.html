<pre> Toni Muller &lt;75223.1575@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I assume we will be learning more about the aliens in Carolyn's
&gt; visions? Was the fact that there are no telepaths left on Narn
&gt; part of the reason the Shadows were so eager to help the Centauri
&gt; destroy them? Easy prey without "weapons" - a nice first battle?
&gt; Will we learn what became of the other telepaths aboard the
&gt; transport?

      Certainly, that there were no teeps on Narn made them easy
targets, as were their ships.  They would also have a vested interest
in subduing them because of the knowledge they have, revealed here.  If
you'll remember, in "Matters of Honor," they mention to Morden that
they've only been able to track down some Narn legends.  Morden's
reply: "Well, we've taken care of that problem."  Had G'Kar not been
out and about, they might have succeeded.

                                                                  jms
