<pre> Theo Thourson &lt;73214.2131@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; If one of the characters, let's say Delenn for no good reason,
&gt; has a secret agenda, or is a traitor to the rest of the crew, or
&gt; something equally devious, does Mira know about it? In other
&gt; words, do the actors know everything the characters know?

      Sometimes yes, sometimes no.  Depends on whether I want them to
play the process or the result when leading up to that.

                                                                  jms
