<H2>B5 FAN CLUB INFO!</H2>
<h3>Date: 09-Apr-96 17:58:16</h3>
<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Is the fan club going to have its own e-mail address?

       Eventually we'll have our own web site, probably within the
coming month, which will provide some rather nifty services....

                                                                  jms
