<pre> Toni Muller &lt;75223.1575@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; And I thought that finally I could just feel happy about an
&gt; episode, but then you had to end it with the whole thing about
&gt; Kosh being Merlin...and who is Morgana LaFaye?

      Thanks, and yes, Marcus and Franklin make a good team, it's a
nice balance.  And Marcus did fit in well with the whole Arthur
storyline (it's kind of an obvious but well-fitting match).

      As for Marcus' line...sometimes offhand remarks are only offhand
remarks...and sometimes they aint....

                                                                  jms
