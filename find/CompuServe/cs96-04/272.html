<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Was Sniper one of them?

      They were both true believers.

      I also went just a little here for a kind of metaphorical
approach; prior to this, Nightwatch folks have always been presented as
starched, scrubbed, visually appealing...the face they wanted others to
see.  Now we see their true face, the scarred, dark, empty eyes, no
longer pretending to hide. So we kinda cast in that direction.

                                                                  jms
