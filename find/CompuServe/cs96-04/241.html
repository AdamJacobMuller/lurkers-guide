<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Questions: (1) Was Dellen partially responsible for Dukhat's
&gt; death? (2) Does she _think_ she is responsible?
&gt; Or is this just an artifact of Minbari/English translation?
&gt; Could Dellen's anger have caused her to exagerate?
&gt; Does she feel that her destiny in the Minbari/Human joining
&gt; somehow caused the incident that killed Dukhat?

      No, she doesn't feel responsible; it's an artifact of the way
they approach certain things.  "His word is on my lips, his spirit is
in my eyes." It's almost a way of saying he's speaking through me, back
off.

                                                                  jms
