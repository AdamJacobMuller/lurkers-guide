<pre> Rick Sharon &lt;76416.2213@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; What can I say?
&gt; Is this your best to date?
&gt; You and your entire crew (actors, special effects, casting -
&gt; EVERYONE) must be extremely proud of this masterpiece - as well
&gt; as a little aprehensive - how do you top this?? But, who are the
&gt; traitors? But, what of the Grey Council members that broke from
&gt; the council to side with Delenn? Traitors to what had been their
&gt; ruling body? Probably won't be enough, but at least he'd go down
&gt; fighting and it could help distract Clark's troops? I guess their
&gt; (Shadows) time of quiet preparation is over? Definitely not
&gt; comfortable but, who would would be? I could almost see/hear the
&gt; wheels turning in John's head ("this is it, no turning back, time
&gt; for "the" decision, it's in my hands, -my- decision" - replaying
&gt; events up to that point, wrestling with alternatives, "are there
&gt; alternatives?"
&gt;  - just plain numb over the weight of these events?
&gt; ships, situation hopeless - surrender or die?
&gt; "What do I tell his and Hague's wives?"

        Wow, that's a lengthy examination.  Thank you for all that,
and the effort.  Great encouragement.  I appreciate it.

                                                                  jms
