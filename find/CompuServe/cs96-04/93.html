<pre> Sandra G. Bruckner &lt;76642.3664@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; When you mentioned the editing problems you were encountering
&gt; with DC in your phone conversation to the DC Gathering a while
&gt; back, did you notice the reaction? Everyone was apalled that some
&gt; comic book editor would have the nerve to want to re-write your
&gt; story? How can someone else write it better than you can?

      Yeah, it's kind of the Red Queen's Race sort of logic.

                                                                  jms
