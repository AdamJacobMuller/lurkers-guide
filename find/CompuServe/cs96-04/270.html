<pre> Arwel Parry &lt;100336.623@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I like the new title sequence, the new theme has just the right
&gt; feel of impending doom and foreboding - will Chris Franke be
&gt; putting it on the new CD? or is it just a figure of speech in the
&gt; same way that when Sheridan "takes out" a Centauri cruiser he's
&gt; not taking it to a candlelit dinner or the movies? Marcus Cole
&gt; looks like an interesting character, but from what he said about
&gt; how he and his brother joined the Rangers it seems as if their
&gt; existence is quite generally known, at least in some circles -
&gt; how come EA and the Shadows' agents haven't heard about them? and
&gt; have ISN kept quiet about them? Thanks again for another
&gt; entertaining programme - you keep saying you're getting better
&gt; all the time, but will any of your audience survive the tension
&gt; in season 5?!

      Actually, the B5 third year theme is an expanded version,
somewhat altered, of the "Requiem for the Line" piece, which is already
on the current CD.

                                                                  jms
