<pre> R. Thomas &lt;71544.3171@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; station commander/leader figure etc.?

      Actually, it was no problem at all.  The similarity is only if
you choose to define them by their narrow roles.  Their personalities
are vastly different.  Also, Sinclair's been through a lot in the
intervening couple of years, he's grown, he and Marcus would definitely
have something of a relationship since he would've been there while
Marcus was being trained, and so on.  And their roles in the story are
very different.

      It actually came out pretty well.  I'm very happy with it.

                                                                  jms
