<pre> Steve Augustine &lt;102202.200@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Can anyone tell me what I am doing wrong when I try to access the
&gt; personnel files on the CD?

       The scritttttt sound is the same sound made by the identicard
scanners in the show; watch the start of Severed Dreams, you'll hear it
there.

                                                                  jms
