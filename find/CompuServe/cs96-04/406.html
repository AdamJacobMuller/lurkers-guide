<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Who is rightous and who is just egotistical?"
&gt; I wonder if this critic has watched and enjoyed B5?

      Could you possibly send me a copy of that review?  I'd
appreciate it. You can send it along to me at the following address:

      14431 Ventura Boulevard, Suite 260, Sherman Oaks, CA 91423

      Thanks!

                                                                  jms
