<H2>&lt;STV: a Narn question&gt;</H2>
<h3>Date: 19-Apr-96 01:53:32</h3>
<pre> Steve Ramage &lt;74731.235@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; You know -- the one lying tied up on the floor, waiting to find
&gt; out if he's going to be done with his own blade? Is this yet
&gt; another thread I'm going to have to keep in my head, or was he,
&gt; his contribution to this episode concluded, returned to
&gt; supernumerary Hell?

      No, nothing happened to him; Vir wouldn't ever do that.

                                                                  jms
