<pre> Deonaha M. Conlin &lt;102531.2627@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Do advertisers have to stay within those boundaries?

      Advertisers generally go right up to the limits of the sound,
but can't go over it.  They just use up *all* the frequency range, so
it seems louder and bigger.

                                                                  jms
