<pre> Marshall L. Moseley &lt;102264.2343@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Can you tell us the status on the hoped-for straight to video b5
&gt; movie for the summer?

      WB hasn't said much about the direct-to-video movie, though
they're now discussing a true feature.  It's just the usual up and
downs that come from the studios as they try to figure out what to do
with us.

                                                                  jms
