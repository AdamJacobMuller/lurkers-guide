<pre> Mike Hoffmann &lt;100321.2604@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; And thus my question about this on EA ships: while we are shown
&gt; that they have rotating compartments, what happens when these
&gt; ships are under acceleration (or deceleration)?

      Narns are strapped in because they don't have artificial
gravity, or rotating sections; if they weren't strapped in they'd be
floating about.

      C&amp;C is a little over one-third of the way from the central hub. 
This gives you about 33-35% of normal gravity, so a person weighing 200
pounds would weigh about 66-70.  (Yes, we did the math on this.)  So
you're not going to see anybody bouncing around the walls.

                                                                  jms
