      "I do remember it looking much worse earlier on."

      Your memory is correct.  Just before he did the first episode,
he had to shave his full beard for some commercial audition.  It hadn't
grown all the way back, and we had to darken it down a bit to make it
work.  It's all back now.

                                                                  jms
