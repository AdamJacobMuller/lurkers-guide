<pre> Paul Owen &lt;100331.2357@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; 1 how much more advanced are the Centauri than EA ?
&gt; the Blockade Mines seemed to pick up the extremely advanced White
&gt; Star quite quickly and yet the older larger Minbari cruisers were
&gt; not detectable by the EA during the Minbari War, even Sinclair in
&gt; Season 1believed that they still should not have been able to
&gt; pick up Minbari fighters ?

      No, it's slightly audible to others, but is the sort of thing
generally lost in the crowd; we ignore stuff a lot.

                                                                  jms
