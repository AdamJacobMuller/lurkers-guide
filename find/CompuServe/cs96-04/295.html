      Problem is I'm *very* eclectic.  I listen to just about
everything, depending on my mood, except for hard-ass country
(bluegrass is an exception to this).  Japanese, Celtic, heavy-metal,
classic rock, classical, big band, Enya, you name it.  They all go into
the player at some point.

                                                                  jms
