      Thanks (and thanks for the vote).  They gave me the option of
having the two nominations or withdrawing one of the two, and we
decided to go ahead and withdraw "Fall," to avoid splitting the vote,
and to allow another entry into the field, which was apparently "12
Monkeys," which definitely deserves the recognition of the nomination.

                                                                 jms
