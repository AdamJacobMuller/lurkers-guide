<pre> David Cerreta &lt;72630.3433@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Who wouldn't believe he was Arthur?
&gt; Then why was he there?

      Thanks.  I *really* like this episode a lot.  The performance,
the music, everything works; I tried to get a little artsy, try out
some different kinds of stuff, stretch some muscles I haven't used
enough, and it came out very nicely.  It's just nifty.

                                                                  jms
