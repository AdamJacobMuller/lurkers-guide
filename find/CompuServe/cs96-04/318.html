<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Does Meatloaf listen better than he watches?
&gt; Were you aware that the studio address and phone numbers are now
&gt; available to lots of fans?

      That information was bound to get out sooner or later.  It's
okay.  We have Narns working security.

      Yeah, Meatloaf definitely "listens better than he watches,"
though in truth he's lost a LOT of weight lately, and looks 100% better
than in past years.  Most of his songs (even though written often with
or by others) tell stories, they have a lot of heart to them, they're
sometimes very funny, and there's a tremendous, enviable energy in
them.  You get the sense that he undrstands the only way to tell a
story sometimes is to put the pedal to the floor and go flat out for
the abyss, hoping to come out alive on the other side.  I commend to
you his two latest albums, Bat Out of Hell II and Welcome to the
Neighborhood.  There's some really nifty stuff there.

                                                                  jms
