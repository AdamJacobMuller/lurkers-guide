<pre> Martin Shaw &lt;101642.505@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I was curious as to what is used to keep the communicators on the
&gt; back of the B5 staffs hands? Presumably what you use IRL is
&gt; different from what is used in the B5 universe ? Sorry to drag
&gt; this up again, but when can we expect B5 to appear on laserdisc ? 
&gt; will it be sometime after the tv series has been completed (in
&gt; two years time)?

      My thought is that it's a molecular compound that naturally
adheres to the epidermis.

      No word on disks yet; when there's something to announce, you
won't have to ask about it, I'll be blasting it all over the place.

                                                                  jms
