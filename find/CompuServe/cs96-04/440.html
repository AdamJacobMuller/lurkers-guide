<h3>Date: 29-Apr-96 21:52:36</h3>
<pre> James R. Kapesis &lt;104154.27@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Since you already have the story of how G'Quon defeated the
&gt; shadows figured out, would you consider simply posting the story
&gt; on the internet?

      I think I'd rather hold it for now, on the chance that I can use
it somewhere, or in time turn it into something larger.

                                                                  jms
