<pre> Phil Koltko &lt;71604.2145@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Joe, Is there any hope of convincing David Gerrold to write a B5
&gt; novel?

       Thanks.  Marcus is a great character...he can go back and forth
between deadly serious and quite funny without batting an eye, it's all
quite smooth. He adds a lot to the show.

                                                                  jms
