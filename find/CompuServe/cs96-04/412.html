<pre> Robin L. Small &lt;76640.2012@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I'm assuming that this was intentional?

      No, so far, I'd say your analysis was quite good.  To some
extent, you also have to go outside strict Greek storytelling structure
in terms of saga and also go into classic Greek theater, especially the
tragedies.

      In that particular form, a character may have a destiny, or
there's a prophecy, and the character does all he can to avoid that
destiny, but everything he does only brings him closer to it. 
Certainly there's a lot of that in Londo, for instance.

      There's also the thematic issues of hubris, of the descent into
the underworld, the oracle, and other elements of Greek and general
mythic storytelling.

                                                                  jms
