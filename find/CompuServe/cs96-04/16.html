<pre> Mark &lt;70004.1111@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; What kind of medium are you dumping the 24 bit data to?
&gt; How much "hard drive" space does say a 10 second efx shot take
&gt; up? You wouldn't happen to have the raw data of a Shadow ship
&gt; hanging around would ya?

       ...urk...math...technospeak.....(thud)

       That's a Ron question.  Rendering not Zathras' skill.

                                                                  jms
