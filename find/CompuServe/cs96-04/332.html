<h3>Date: 18-Apr-96 19:16:08</h3>
<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Is he still around, or is that a small comet that went by?

      When he failed to convince the other Narns to accept him as
their new leader -- which was the whole point to his being sent to B5
in the first place
 -- he had no choice but to go home.

                                                                  jms
