<H2>SD - ISN News question</H2>
<h3>Date: 10-Apr-96 16:14:04</h3>
<pre> Troy Starr &lt;74752.3172@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Just how much did the reporters at ISN know, and how long have
&gt; they known it? Has President Clark been using the information
&gt; gathered by ISN's reporters (such as what is going on out in
&gt; space and what the people/citizens of Earth think) for his own
&gt; purposes? did he have someone from the political office review
&gt; every news script before they went on the air)?

      I'm sorry, but we cannot answer your question at this time.  We
are experincing temporary transmission problems with ISN, but hope to
have the situation remedied very soon.  Meanwhile, you can direct any
inquiries for information to the Ministry of Peace, and the Ministry
for Public Information, which has been aiding all public information
broadcasts for almost two years now.

      At the tone, please leave your name and identicard number. 
Don't worry about calling back.  We'll find you.
