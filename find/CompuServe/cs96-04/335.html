      If I'd wanted Big Money, I'd've stayed on MURDER, SHE WROTE,
where I was paid *twice* what I get on B5, given that it's a top-ten
rated network show. But I left that to do this.

      This isn't a random casting about for an idea that makes money. 
For one thing, "ideas" don't make shows, characters do.  Second, if
what you posit were true, I wouldn't have built the show so that it
self-destructs after 5 years.  Finally, every season of this show for
three years plus the pilot for four has pushed the envelope completely;
we only have two years left.  Not much time to settle into complacency,
wouldn't you say?

      Maybe you should bea little less cynical and insulting about a
field about which you do not seem terribly well informed.

                                                                  jms
