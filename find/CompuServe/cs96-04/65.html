      What you also have to bear in mind sometimes is that *this* is
the only way to get things done.  When the Allies stormed Normandy
Beach, they knew that German bunkers and machine nests and fortified
positions were right there on the beach waiting for them.  But they
stormed out, onto the beach, and the first lines were cut down, one
after another after another, hundreds, literally thousands of soldiers.
But those behind were able to get through, take up position as best
they could.  Some of them clung to the edges of cliffs as Germans above
laughed and threw down grenades into their midst.

      Sometimes there's no other way.  But you do it because those who
command you have the moral authority to say "You probably will not come
back, but the cause is just, and fair, and necessary."

      Thus do we go off to die.

                                                                  jms
