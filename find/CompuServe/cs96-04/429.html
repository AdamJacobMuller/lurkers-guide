<h3>Date: 29-Apr-96 12:57:29</h3>
<pre> Vicki Mitchell &lt;76234.1317@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Delenn has absolved the humans of their guilt in the
&gt; Earth/Minbari war by forgiving "Arthur"/David McIntyre -- but has
&gt; she forgiven herself for her role in the war? And if not, is there
&gt; anyone among the humans from whom she could accept absolution?

       You're right, that's a good question.

                                                                  jms
