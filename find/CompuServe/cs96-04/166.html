<H2>Mechanical evolution?</H2>
<h3>Date: 08-Apr-96 23:11:30</h3>
<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Do you design your ships so that the more advanced they get, the
&gt; more animal-like they become? Kind of like backwards evolution, we
&gt; start out animal-like, then become more mechanical, then the
&gt; mechanics become animal-like?

      Certainly as they get more sophisticated, when just *doing it*
isn't the main goal, a certain level of aesthetics comes into play. 
Compare an early Model T to a modern Corvette, for instance.

                                                                  jms
