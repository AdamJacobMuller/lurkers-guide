       "...hit between the eyes."   Yeah, that's the correct reaction,
I'd say.

       Yes, it's easy to fire on the enemy when it's a faceless
entity; not as easy when it's someone you know.  Kinda brings it home,
makes it personal.

       We rode the audio on some sequences right to the legal limit;
don't know if we got clamped at any point along the way, to explain the
surround drop.  Will look into it.

       Thanks again.

                                                                  jms
