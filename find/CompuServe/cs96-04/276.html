<pre> Philip Hornsey &lt;74053.2101@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Incidently, are we supposed to buy this "I know her destiny is
&gt; with someone else and I have accepted it" stuff?

      Well, there was certainly that little catch in his voice, that

                                                                  jms
