<pre> John M. Graham &lt;74166.3727@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; You ignored the question, "Was what was going on in real Earth
&gt; History about 1000 years ago relevant?" Note, when Delan says the
&gt; last war was 1000 years ago, was that Earth or Minbar years? Was
&gt; this intentional?

      No, that period on Earth was not terribly significant to the
arc.

                                                                  jms
