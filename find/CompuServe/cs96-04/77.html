<pre> Randy Upshaw &lt;75464.1275@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; So Is "Ship of tears" the next big arc episode?

      Exactly.  If you're going to do something as monumental as what
Sheridan does here re: B5's status and Earth, it can't be done lightly
or frivolously or without sufficient cause.  It has to be an absolutely
last resort.  If we'd done it any sooner, it would've been less
effective, and more of a cheat.

      And yes, after two breather stories, "Ship of Tears" starts the
arc moving again, and with very few exceptions doesn't let up for the
rest of the season.

                                                                  jms
