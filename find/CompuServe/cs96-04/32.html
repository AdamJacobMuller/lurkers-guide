<pre> Benoit Langevin &lt;74434.3136@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; And by the way for the last two week, we don't see the next week
&gt; preview, is it in the satelite uplink or is it our station,
&gt; CFCF-12-Montreal, that didn't put it on air?

       No, it's a different scene than the flash-forward in Babylon
Squared.

                                                                  jms
