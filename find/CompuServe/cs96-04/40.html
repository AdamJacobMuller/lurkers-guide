<H2>Dust to Dust question</H2>
<h3>Date: 03-Apr-96 21:11:55</h3>
<pre> James R. Kapesis &lt;104154.27@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Who is the second Narn that G'Kar talks to?
&gt; Is it his father again or G'Quon?

      It's the same thing, the image of his father.

                                                                  jms
