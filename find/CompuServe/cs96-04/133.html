      Thanks.  What you say about relationships is quite true.  The
slow process of getting to know somebody, the courtship, the parries
and feints and false starts are 85% of the fun.  It's the process of
getting into somebody's mind, discovering who they are.  And that's
what these two are doing.  It's an awful lot of fun.

                                                                  jms
