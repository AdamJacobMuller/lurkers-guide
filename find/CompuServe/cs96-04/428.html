<h3>Date: 28-Apr-96 22:12:16</h3>
<pre> James R. Kapesis &lt;104154.27@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; If all the Narn telepaths are dead, what happened to the Narn
&gt; telepaths that helped G'Quon defeat the Shadows?

      Those were the last remaining ones, the older telepaths, their
children all killed, too old now to produce any further children, and
the technology of cloning or genetics was still way beyond them.

      The story of the last crusade of G'Quan is actually quite
interesting; I hope to get it into the show at some point.  Right now
it's mainly background, even though I've worked it out fully.

                                                                  jms
