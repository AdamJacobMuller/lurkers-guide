<pre> Rebecca Eschliman &lt;76072.2345@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; "Will you give all you can give so that our battle may advance?
&gt; Some will fall and some will live; will you stand up and take the
&gt; chance?"

      Thanks.  Yeah, the older I get, the more I realize there are
things you can do with silence you can't do with words, though I still
love the form of the speech.  There was a lot of counterpoint in this
episode, a tool I'm still playing with as a writer; eventually I'll
figure out how to really use it properly.  (Though there's an
interesting scene up later this season using another kind of ironic
counterpoint which I think works pretty well.)

                                                                  jms
