<H2>&lt;Rage's Thots: CoL&amp;D&gt;</H2>
<h3>Date: 15-Apr-96 20:45:15</h3>
<pre> Chad Underkoffler &lt;102512.1310@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; If you were trying to regain control of Babylon 5, would you
&gt; leave it in the hands of these nimrods? Why didn't Bochs assign
&gt; him a "handler"? Sniper's reaction to Delenn's "pity" speech: "You
&gt; pity me? However, why did he notify Susan before Garibaldi when
&gt; Delenn and Lennan were taken by the NWTs? Does he really dislike
&gt; Michael that much, or was it just to give us another AI scene? 
&gt; What aliens hasn't the guy played? Have we seen him as an Earther?
&gt; A question: Why didn't our heroes attempt to work with the
&gt; nudjing computer? and just WHAT was Delenn reacting to there?
&gt; Does everyone get them, or just command staff?
&gt; Yet, why are they *BLACK*?

      "They're all so GOOD."

      Gotta be.  No other choice.

      (Actually, we had 3 more quickie scenes with the computer voice,
but the ep ran long over time, and we were locked into some
walk-and-talks where we couldn't make other trims.)

                                                                  jms
