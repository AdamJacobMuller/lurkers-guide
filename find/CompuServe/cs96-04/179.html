<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Is there a spoiler sheet for the episodes that have aired so far
&gt; this season?

       We're not on UPN, by the way, though some UPN stations carry
us.

       Try the Lurker's Guide, http://hyperion.com, which has synopses
of all B5 episodes.

                                                                  jms
