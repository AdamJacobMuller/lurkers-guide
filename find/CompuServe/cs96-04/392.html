<pre> Rick Sharon &lt;76416.2213@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; You wouldn't do that to us, right?
&gt; RIGHT??
&gt; That's even cuter than teddy bears (ugh!!) Uh, Joe, you wouldn't,
&gt; Right?!??? the baseball bat?

      Wow, thanks for all of that, and for the letter(s).  They'll be
eminently helpful.  The hard work is much appreciated.

                                                                  jms
