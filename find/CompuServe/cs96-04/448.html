<pre> Trent K. Johnson &lt;71020.1052@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; If there's no potential conflict and any one is interested, may I
&gt; upload it?

      I suppose it could be uploaded (if included with proper link
info to the B5 web page)...but yeah, just run it past me first so's I
can check it out.

                                                                  jms
