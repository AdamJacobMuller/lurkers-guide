<pre> Steve Augustine &lt;102202.200@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; You mean even when a picture of Delenn, Vir, or the others
&gt; display during the screen saver, it's supposed to make that same
&gt; 'scritttt' sound?

       No, if you're talking about the white screens with the black
and white photos and text, no, it's all Identicard stuff.  (Check the
pilot, and you'll see the same display used there for Lyta's entrance.)

                                                                  jms
