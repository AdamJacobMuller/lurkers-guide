<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Of course, one wonders how he managed to get such a plum
&gt; position, hmmm? When exactly did the effects get finished for this
&gt; episode?

      All I'll say here is that there were *so* many EFX here that we
mixed the episode a few days before delivery, and got it down there 2
hours before the process for uplinking the episode to stations.  It was
the hardest thing we've ever done...but it was worth it.

                                                                  jms
