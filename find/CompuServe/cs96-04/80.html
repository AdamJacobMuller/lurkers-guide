<pre> Daniel M. Upton &lt;75442.1331@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Does this mean that there are warrior and worker caste Minbari
&gt; doing religous duties in the temples and warrior and religious
&gt; caste Minbari doing worker caste duties as well?

      No, those aspects are kept absolutely separate and
caste-specific. It's only when you get into the warships that, by
tradition, some warrior caste have been involved with the others,
mainly as a courtesy.

                                                                  jms
