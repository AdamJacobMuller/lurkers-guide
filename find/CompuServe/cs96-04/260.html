<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Are you going to be doing a Sunday afternoon session at Marcon in
&gt; Columbus May 5th?

      I haven't seen a Marcon schedule yet, so I dunno....

      And yes, because anything can happen to anyone around here, it
makes this kind of thing more interesting.

      I was thinking about this the other day, and realized just how
much some aspects of the show remind me of a role playing game; you set
up the parameters, you know where the story has to go, and you bring in
some characters.  Some will live, die, be hindered, succeed, fail, or
go mad, depending on how the players react to the situation.

                                                                  jms
