<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Will B5 ever address in its universe why the alien races waited
&gt; so long before making first contact with Earth? Did EA have to
&gt; pass some technology test to get contacted by the Centauri? Or,
&gt; did they just come across us accidently and try to exploit us for
&gt; their own political purposes?

       Yeah, I'll probably try to get to it, but the basic reality is
that nobody really either knew or cared much that we were here...we
were kind of off the beaten track.

                                                                  jms
