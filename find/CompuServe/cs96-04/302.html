<pre> Rebecca Eschliman &lt;76072.2345@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; This makes me wonder which the personnel of Bablyon 5 (or anyone,
&gt; for that matter) will regret most: the lost moments of actions
&gt; wrongly taken or the lost moments of actions not taken at all?

       Thanks.  I just ordered it the second the information you
provided appeared on my screen.  Looking forward to it....

                                                                  jms
