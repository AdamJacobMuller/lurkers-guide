<H2>B5 FAN CLUB INFO!</H2>

<pre> SysOp Dupa T Parrot &lt;70040.104@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Are you guys planning to use the NetSrcape Commerce (or other)
&gt; secure web server?

      No, I absolutely agree, which is why that won't be the only
venue for such information.  Anybody who's not comfortable with that
will have other options.

                                                                  jms
