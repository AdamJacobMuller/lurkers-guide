<pre> John M. Graham &lt;74166.3727@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; How did you do this effect?
&gt; Is this correct?
&gt; Why the initial zoom out?

      Yes, the way you describe the shot (zoom/move) was correct. 
It's what was indicated in the script, and well executed.

                                                                  jms
