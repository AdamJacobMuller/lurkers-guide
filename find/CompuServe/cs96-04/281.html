<H2>&lt;Sic Transit Vir&gt;</H2>
<h3>Date: 15-Apr-96 20:45:06</h3>
<pre> David Cerreta &lt;72630.3433@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; All Earth Force personnel no longer are being paid, are they?
&gt; Who is replenishing supplies?
&gt; Are things being bartered?
&gt; Are the Minbari picking up the slack?
&gt; Is that its function for the time being?

      Thanks.  Dealing with the financial and support situation comes
up next week.

      And agree re: Vir.  He's a much stronger character than anyone
might think.  He's sort of the "God's Fool" character, to get literary
for a second, who somehow manages to make it through it all.

                                                                  jms
