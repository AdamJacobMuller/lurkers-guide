<pre> David Belt &lt;72142.1365@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I realize that this is not another household, but my son will now
&gt; start raving to his friends at school, so who knows? Question,
&gt; will we learn more about the fate of Anna Sheridan this season? 
&gt; Will we see more of Sinclair after this season?

       Thanks...and we'll certainly hear more about Anna Sheridan's
fate this season.

                                                                  jms
