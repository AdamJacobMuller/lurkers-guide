      We shot the last scene with the cane *before* we shot the scene
in which Jerry broke his arm.  It costs way too much to go back and
reshoot.  At the time we shot the later scene, he hadn't yet broken his
arm.

      And G'Kar isn't all the way in yet; he wants to be, but so far
he's still being held at arm's length a bit...he may make an issue of
this.

                                                                  jms
