<pre> Rebecca Eschliman &lt;76072.2345@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Does the title for "All My Dreams, Torn Asunder" derive from a
&gt; quotation? If it doesn't derive from a quotation, how about a
&gt; quotation derived from it?

      No, as far as I can remember, it's just something I thunk up.

                                                                  jms
