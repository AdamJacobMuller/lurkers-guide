<pre> T.P.Chai &lt;104674.3064@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; " Was that intentional on your or his part, or accidental?

      It just sorta worked out that way; it wasn't something we did or
he asked for intentionally.  Some things happen through a weird,
organic kind of synchronicity.  That's one of them.

                                                                  jms
