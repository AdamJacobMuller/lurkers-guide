      I know...if I do a bunch of arc episodes in a row, certain
people say it's "obviously rushed."  If I take a more leisurely pace to
develop certain characters and themes, the same folks say it's
"wandering, lost its way."

      The show is what the show is, and what the show is, is what I
wanted to write.

                                                                  jms
