<pre> Philip Hornsey &lt;74053.2101@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; How in the hell do things like that get on broadcast?
&gt; Are their tiers of editors?
&gt; Do these guys have a journeyman while B5 got a master?
&gt; I understand that they have essentially the same budget as you
&gt; (in the neighborhood of a million an ep give or take), so what's
&gt; the deal?

      Not knowing the situation, it would be inappropriate for me to
comment.

                                                                  jms
