<pre> Philip Hornsey &lt;74053.2101@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I am, however, moved to ask, are you getting a lot of repeat
&gt; business from the naysayers?

      Oh, I still hear plenty from the naysayers...they can't argue
with the quality of the episodes now, so they say, "Well, it's too
little, too late," totally ignoring all that went before to set this
up.

      Screw 'em.  This season, there wasn't any pressure, there wasn't
any fighting for renewal since we knew this was gonna be it, so I wrote
exactly the show that I wanted to write.  As long as more folks like it
than don't, which is precisely the case here, that's all that matters.

                                                                  jms
