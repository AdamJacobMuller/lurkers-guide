      Well, do bear in mind that the events in "War" were 17 years
after the fact, so the shadow allies could have come at any time;
Sheridan didn't fully understand what a keeper was, and also bear in
mind that there is no reason to suspect anything in this situation. 
People can indeed start wars without having keepers on them, you know. 
We do it all the time.  He would have to have some overwhelming
proof...and even then, if he says anything to Londo, he might risk
changing the timeline, and that would have potentially disasterous 
consequences.

                                                                  jms
