"FWIW, and I speak from no direct knowledge, only overheard
scuttlebutt, Paramount *couldn't* film what Harlan wrote.  They simply
didn't have the budget.  It got "hacked", I grant you, but it got
hacked into a filmable format.  The world's best screenplay is
worthless if it can't be filmed."

      Except that in this case, it *was* filmable...the rest is the
mythology that's grown up around it.

                                                                  jms
