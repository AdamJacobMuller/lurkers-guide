<pre> Kevin Kenney &lt;104102.352@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Even if the fighters shown were only part of the escort, leading
&gt; Redstar 9 away, shouldn't they have been a bit more active? What
&gt; was your intent?

      No, they were fighting...they were just more running away than
they were fighting.

                                                                  jms
