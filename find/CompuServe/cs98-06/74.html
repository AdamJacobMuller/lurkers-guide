"PS: This is something that gnaws at my subconscious...  In one of the
very 1st episodes wasn't the gender of Santiago given as female by an
ISN reporter speaking about the coming election?  There are so few
flubs in the story arc that I almost feel sure it is my immagination
BUT it gnaws..."

      It's your imagination; that was the candidate running against
Santiago, not the guy himself.  I know because we used Doug's picture
for Santiago, and a picture of our wardrobe designer for the
opposition.

                                                                  jms
