<pre> Tom Knudsen &lt;72347.1626@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; That was Goran's episode??

"I have to say this was one of the best episodes of the entire series.
If this is any indication of what the rest of the season is
like.......watch out."

      Well, the next episode is even more so...and the one after that,
more so still.  You get a slight breather for an episode or so -- still
very strongly arc, though, just not as in-your-face hardhitting -- and
then the last are whammers.

"I suspect a stream of apologies to your are about to begin."

      Yeah, right, and pandas will fly out of my butt.

                                                                  jms
