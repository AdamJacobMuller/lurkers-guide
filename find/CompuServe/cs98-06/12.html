      I go by Joe.  Call me Joe.  Joe is fine.  Joe is simpler to
spell, quicker to type, friendlier on-screen, one syllable.  Michael is
two syllables, and I don't respond to it.

      Straczynski, pronounced just right and with the proper force
behind it, can actually strike a cow dead at twenty paces.

                                                                  jms
