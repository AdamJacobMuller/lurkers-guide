<pre> Marte Brengle &lt;76703.4242@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; how *would* a human and a Narn mate, anyway?

      Well, as G'Kar said in the pilot, there would have to be rather
substantial genetic manipulation and adjustment to allow for the
different DNA structures to mix.

      After that, it would require the usual: dinner, flowers, and
being willing to sit through a chick-flick....

                                                                  jms
