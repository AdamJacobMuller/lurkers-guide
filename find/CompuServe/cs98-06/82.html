<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Really?&lt;startled&gt; I can see the beginnings of Mr Thornton's CGI
&gt; designs, but the sets were not much like B5&lt;G&gt; (to many pieces of
&gt; polystyrene rock for my taste&lt;slightly embarrassed g&gt;) Is this a
&gt; reflection of the behind the scenes development rather than the
&gt; visual elements? what actually WAS going to happen in captain
&gt; power? I know you had said that the suits would become defective,
&gt; and the group would be in a lot of trouble, but is it possible to
&gt; point me at any place where i can see how the planned 3 year arc
&gt; would have come out?

      I think there's a CP site out there somewhere (try Yahoo) that
has the full message I posted about the long-term arc.

      RE: the different art direction between CP and B5...it's not so
much development as choosing the right look for the right show.
