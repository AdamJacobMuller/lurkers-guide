<H2>Where's the WHAM?????</H2>
<h3>Date: 17 Jun 1998 23:02:07 -0700</h3>
<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; And we have to wait FOUR MONTHS to find out what happens
&gt; NEXT?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!

      Well, it's kinda what I've been saying all along...the bigger
the planned wham, the longer the quiet ramp-up.  And, again, the arc
was there when it didn't seem to be: this whole thing started when the
raids started to take place, which goes back quite a ways.  And Lyta
would not be in this position, not this assertive with her abilities,
had she not gone through the fire (literally and figuratively) with
Byron, whose fate more or less kicked her out of her shell.  The old
Lyta would never have just up and gone to the Drazi homeworld on her
own; but the money, needed to follow her and Byron's dream, propelled
her.

      It was ALL there, more or less in plain view.

      And without it, without all that careful and deliberate setup,
this episode (and especially those that follow) would never have played
as well, if at all.

                                                                  jms
