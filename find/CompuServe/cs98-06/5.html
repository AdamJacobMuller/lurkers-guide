<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Also, when you say Warner Brothers, to which company are you
&gt; referring to?

      I'm sorry, but there is only ONE Warner Bros.  There are offices
of the company, as with any company, but they are all owed by Warner
Bros. in the United States, here in Burbank, and it was from the main
office that this has come.  There are some folks involved here who are
trying to muddy the situation by saying there are all these different
companies, but there aren't. There is only one IBM, and only one Ford,
and only one Warner Bros. And it's that main office that I've been
dealing with on this.

      Sorry, I am *not* confusing the situation.  It's others who are
trying to blur the facts here.  Perhaps if you were less obviously
trying to justify their activities, you might be able to see that.

                                                                  jms
