<H2>UK B5 Screening Now Free</H2>
<h3>Date: 13 Jun 1998 23:38:09 -0700</h3>
<pre> Ansawdd &lt;113556.402@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; could "In the Beginning" be the first B5 movie?
&gt; And another thing - a screening in July?
&gt; Which year?
&gt; I suppose that this is mostly down to the use of Computer
&gt; Graphics?

      ItB is the B5 prequel TV movie, which aired here in the US in
January, and will be released on tape in the UK shortly.

                                                                  jms
