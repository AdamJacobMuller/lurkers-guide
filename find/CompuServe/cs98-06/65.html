      However there are a lot of hidden costs in the Wolf conventions.
For instance, at the SFX awards, we (John Copeland and I) were under
the impression that that was just a part of the convention's overall
umbrella, only to discover that the fans attending sprung for an
additional 30 pounds each to be at the tables.  (When we discovered
this, rather to our horror, John and I decided we had better be damned
more entertaining, and used our drink chits to take care of the table
all night, so it would balance out at lesat a little.)  At the end of
the day, when you add up the hidden costs, it works out about the same,
as when they tried to charge for the ItB screening that was supposed to
be free to convention attendees.

                                                                  jms
