"Were there merchandising issues with Ghostbusters?"

      Moreso with other shows I did, like HeMan and SheRa and Jayce;
in TRGBs we just ignored whatever the toy company wanted.

"BTW: always wondered, who thought up the movie-within-the-cartoon
thing with the Ghostbusters toon? I just loved they showed scenes from
the movie in one of the episodes..."

      I wrote that one.  I *think* it was called "Take Two."

      To this day, as a result, there are bunches of kids who *swear*
up and down that the animated series came first, THEN the movie, much
to the dismay of their siblings and parents.

                                                                  jms
