<pre> Dave Vincent &lt;75460.1133@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; In space?

      That might be a more reasonable concern if it were more of what
one would consider a standard crew that would be concerned about such
things.

      Which is all I can say about it for now.  More in two weeks.

                                                                  jms
