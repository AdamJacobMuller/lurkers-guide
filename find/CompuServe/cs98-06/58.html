"Nonsense, there are much more scarier things on television these
days. Case in point: Fox's "When &lt;insert-entity-here&gt; Attack""

   Next on FOX:

                     "WHEN WRITER-PRODUCERS ATTACK!"

      "Well, er...um...nobody notices...so maybe we shouldn't...never
mind."

   NEXT ON FOX....

                                                                  jms
