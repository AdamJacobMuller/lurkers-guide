      Yeah, that was a visual pun written into the script, the other
shoe dropping...but also reflecting that kind of low energy thing in
the morning, when you put one slipper on, and you just *don't* want to
leave...and you just let the energy drain away, and the slipper falls
from your hand...which also overlaps the gavel dropping, as scripted.

      I took a great deal of care in blocking out every shot in that
one, as opposed to some other cases, as with Mike Vejar, where I wrote,
in "The Face of the Enemy," "They pull down Sheridan like a pack of
wolves bringing down a lion" knowing that he would then take that and
turn it into art.  And he did.

                                                                  jms
