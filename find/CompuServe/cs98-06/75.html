"I think he meant the Filmation thing taken from the Forrest
Tucker/Larry live show that got into all the legal hassle over the
naming (I think you once said that was why you added "Real" into the
name)."

      Oh, that...yeah, there was a live-action show called
Ghostbusters that those two (Larry Storch) did, which sued over the
name Ghostbusters, and won the right to do an animated series by that
name.  Which is why ours was called The Real....
