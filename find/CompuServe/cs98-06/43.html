"Actually, it's possible that this is all just a coincidence of
timing. After all, JMS didn't write these episodes knowing when the
breaks in the season would take place. On the other hand, I hate
coincidence and this is one hell of a big one..."

      Funny thing about that.  When I wrote this, this was the first
part of a very tight two parter (well, actually, it's part 4 of a five
parter; if you watch them straight through, one dovetails right smack
into the next, it's one really huge episode).  Anyway, for the fifth
one, the next one to air, I decided to do a recap in the teaser, a
"Previously on Babylon 5..." compilation.  Hadn't done it with the
others, but just decided to do it with this one, since it picks up
seconds after the other.

      Later, after putting it together, in a phone call with TNT, they
told me about the decision to put in a break after this episode.  "So
you may want to consider putting a recap into the teaser, since this is
a two-parter and it's been a long time and that's something you didnt'
anticipate."

      "Well, actually...I already did that."

      A long pause.  "How did you know?"

      "I didn't."

      Scared 'em real good with that one.

                                                                  jms
