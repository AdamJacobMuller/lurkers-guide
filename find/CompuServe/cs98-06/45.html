"It's almost as if you do some of these things on purpose.  I can see 
it now......"This'll get those little nitpickers.  They'll think I've
screwed up for a few weeks and then I'll make them eat crow."&lt;G&gt;"

      Not that, no, but when some people do jump on these things,
figuring it's a screwup on my part, I can't help but think..."don't you
know what show you're dealing with here?  This is Babylon 5, we don't
MAKE those kind of mistakes."

      I recognize that that's a very self-indulgent thought...but at
the same time, it's true.
