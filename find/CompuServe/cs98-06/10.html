"so that means they were in the loop at some point, and WB knew about
it..."

      That's certainly the party line, being spouted on the Wolf web
site, and repeated by you almost verbatim.

      But nobody ever said Wolf wasn't in the loop...obviously they
were in contact with various people at WB in the first place or the
screening couldn't have been planned in ANY event, at cost or
otherwise.  So this new comeback is utterly silly and absolutely
meaningless.

      The question at hand is how well they were handling the loop.

      Obviously some folks are trying to save face any way they can,
regardless of whether the latest statement actually makes sense or
not.

                                                                  jms
