<pre> Rick Sharon &lt;76416.2213@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; and you do that to them?
&gt; or are going to do to them &lt;maybe, next episodes&gt;?
&gt; Hey, after all the sweet talking I did to you at the start of
&gt; this note, when do the fall episode (full) previews begin? Huh?
&gt; Huh?
&gt; huh?
&gt; can-ya can-ya can-ya?

      Thanks...it's a cool one, exceeded only by those yet to come.
