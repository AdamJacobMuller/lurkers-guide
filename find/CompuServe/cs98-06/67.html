"What was Jayce?"

      An adventure/SF series "Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors," a dopey
concept I again hijacked in an attempt to make it into something more.

"BTW: what was the situation with that other Ghostbusters show?"

      Dunno...they revived it, I heard about it, they dumbed it up,
that's all I know.

                                                                  jms
