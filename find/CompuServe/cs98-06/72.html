<pre> Darran Williams &lt;101656.2143@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Therefore would it make more sense to have 'Day of the Dead'
&gt; after 'The Ragged Edge' and before 'Corps..'?

      We'll probably juggle this about down the road, once we're into
reruns full time.

                                                                  jms
