<pre> Michael Kalus &lt;100265.3065@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Pardon, any chance that we will see such an event in Germany?

      I don't know, that's something that will have to be looked into
by the WB video division in Germany.  Maybe if fans push for it there,
they may be able to do something.

                                                                  jms
