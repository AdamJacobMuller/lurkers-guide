<pre> Rebecca Eschliman &lt;76072.2345@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is this something that you've passed on to your actors and tech
&gt; people?

      To a certain extent, yes, plus I've always encouraged our people
in every department to come out into the spotlight and take the credit
and applause for what they do, so we encourage them to do the comlink
stuff and other appearances.

                                                                  jms
