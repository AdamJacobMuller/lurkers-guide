<H2>Free New B5 Screening UK</H2>
<h3>Date: 22 Jun 1998 00:07:06 -0700</h3>
<pre>      Six years ago, we screened a rough cut of the pilot B5 TV movie
"The Gathering" at Wishcon on the East Coast here in the US.  Those who
saw it have said ever after, "I was there."

      For the first time since then, I'll be screening a work in
progress at the Wrap Party conventin in the UK in August.  This will be
either "The River of Souls," with Martin Sheen and Ian McShane, or "A
Call to Arms," the segue TV movie to Crusade, which introduces some of
the new characters.  (Which I'll bring with me will depend on which is
most done.)  This will be shown free to all convention members.  (Any
kind of screening is going to require a venue in which to show it, and
equipment; the Wrap Party is donating space at a convention that was
already a going event in order to allow me to hold this free screening
for attendees.)

                                                                  jms
