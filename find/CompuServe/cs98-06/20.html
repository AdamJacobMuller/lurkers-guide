<pre> Rebecca Eschliman &lt;76072.2345@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Given (for those of us who have read your TCOS script in your
&gt; scriptwriting book) that you give quite detailed visual details
&gt; in your scripts (angles of shots, focus-points, mood), what is
&gt; the contribution of the director as far as the visual outcome?

      It was shot for shot what I wrote...but at the same time, a
director can realize that well, or poorly.  I thought that Goran did a
terrific job.

                                                                  jms
