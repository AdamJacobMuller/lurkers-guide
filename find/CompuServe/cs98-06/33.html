<pre>{original post had no questions}

      Except, of course, that Lyta has no reason to think that G'Kar
is lying, and she considers him a friend or at least a potential ally,
and that alone would mitigate against the need for any scan.  She
doesn't go around scanning everybody she talks to.

                                                                  jms
