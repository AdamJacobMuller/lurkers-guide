<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Appreciative treatment by TNT, a follow-on series, two episodes
&gt; on a tape and maybe a movie? What is this?
&gt; Excellence on television - being *rewarded*?
&gt; What's the world coming to?

      Thanks...yeah, I can't figure it out either.

                                                                  jms
