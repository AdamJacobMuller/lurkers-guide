<H2>Harlan/jms on Sci-Fi Ch</H2>
<h3>Date: 17 Jun 1998 02:17:05 -0700</h3>
<pre>      For those who get the Sci-Fi Channel, the series MASTERS OF
FANTASY will be doing a half-hour show on Harlan Ellison (Thursday at
5:30 and 9:30, don't know if that's broken down by time zone, and the
following Wednesday at the same times).

      Interviewed were me, Robin Williams, Willam Gibson, Leonard
Nimoy, and other folks.  It actually came out pretty cool.

                                                                  jms
