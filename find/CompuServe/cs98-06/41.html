<pre> Anita Karve &lt;73653.3253@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Which of his books would you recommend I start out with?
&gt; Why oh why did TNT have to leave us hanging with *that* one??!!

      I'd try Shatterday, or Strange Wine.

                                                                  jms
