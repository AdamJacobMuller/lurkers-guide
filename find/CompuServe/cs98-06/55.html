<pre> Julie Mehta &lt;113367.1506@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Does anybody know how extensive JMS's involvement with the
&gt; cartoon "Ghostbusters" actually was? Did he write many episodes?

      I think I wrote close to 20 or so episodes for that one.  I left
when they decided to make Janine into a mommy-character instead of a
strong character, then did a few more later when they realized they'd
made a mistake and wanted her pulled back again.

                                                                  jms
