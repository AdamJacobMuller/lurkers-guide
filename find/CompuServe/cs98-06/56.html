"JMS also had his claws into an episode or two of Captain Power:
Soldier of the Future. Perhaps the less said about that the better (the
show had issues - but it actually tried to be more than a kiddie show  -
but it was gruesomely tied down to a toy that they were forced to
market for). I think JMS was just a writer - though I believe Doug
Netter was a producer (he also of B5 fame).

      I was story editor on that one (wrote 11 episodes), Larry
DiTilio (also of B5 and elsewhere) wrote a bunch, Doug Netter was co-
exec producer, and John Copeland was producer, with some EFX work by
Ron Thornton and set design by John Iacovelli.  It was, in many ways, a
test/launching pad for what would become B5.

                                                                  jms
