<H2>LOSCON: Sunday Still On?</H2>
<h3>Date: 29 Nov 1997 23:03:05 -0700</h3>
<pre> Kevin Kenney &lt;104102.352@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; (My guess...) Will you still be there for the main talk Sunday?

      Yes, the Sunday 1:30 presentation is still on.  What follows
after is not clear; I'm supposed to be autographing, but the program
mentions the HE interview, so I'm not sure what's up there.  The
opening ceremony was over quickly, so you missed it...but I did a
couple of other panels during the day, as well as a quick blip-in at
Hour 25.

                                                                  jms
