<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Does Tracy have an e-mail box at thestation?

      I'm not sure; if not, she will soon.  We've been trying to get
her online officially...I know she lurks about, and has an eye on AOL
and others, but I kinda need to nudge her out into the light a bit.

                                                                  jms
