<pre> John Creigh &lt;75270.423@compuserve.com&gt; asks:

      Thanks...no, that part isn't the crux of the Rangers series,
because that takes place 'way down the road, but monks have always been
around on the show, starting with Brother Theo, so I imagine we'll see
them in future.

                                                                  jms
