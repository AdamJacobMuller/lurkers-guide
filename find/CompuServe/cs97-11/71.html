      Re: speechwriters and others hanging around after the
fall...look at the remains of the Soviet Union.  After the fall of the
communist party, you'd think they would all have been run out of town
on a rail.  But many of them just shifted over and found similar
positions, or kept the communist party going, after everything they'd
done.

      The problem with most people is that they don't hold a grudge
near long enough.

      I'd have to check, but yeah, I believe we stuck a ranger symbol
on the encounter suit.

                                                                  jms
