<pre> Doug Gordon &lt;71610.247@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; a direct decendant of Brother Theo's order on Babylon 5?
&gt; And, if it doesn't reveal any great secrets, is there any chance
&gt; we'll see Brother Theo in Season 5?

"By any chance, is the post-apocalyptic religious order shown in
"Deconstruction . ." a direct decendant of Brother Theo's order on
Babylon 5?"

      It's altogether possible....

      And Theo is only awaiting a story worth bringing him in for.

                                                                  jms
