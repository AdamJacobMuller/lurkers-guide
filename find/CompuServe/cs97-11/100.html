      The part of Lochley is very different from any of those roles;
it was almost certainly the character you were responding to.  Having
now seen her in a number of episodes, I think she's one of the best
additions we've had on the show, quite honestly.  And she's going to be
very popular...though in an offbeat sort of way, because of who *this*
character is.

                                                                  jms
