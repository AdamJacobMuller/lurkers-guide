      Yes, that's the point...there will always be short-term
setbacks, but as long as we climb back a few inches higher than we were
before we fell down, we keep moving toward the goal of becoming a
better people, and getting off the planet.  Taking our place among the
stars.  While it's vaguely possible that I may *see* a Mars colony
sometime within my lifetime, I know that I will never live there...but
that ain't the point, it isn't a victory if *I* do it, and a failure if
*I* don't, it's if *we* do it or not.  Maybe we'll do it today, maybe
we'll do it tomorrow, the point is to decide to DO it, and then by god 
DO IT.

      And yeah, that little closing card is going to remain on the
show for its life...which will be long, long after its detractors (and
admittedly myself) have gone to dust.  On the one hand, it is a
statement of hope to anyone else out there who has a dream, to follow
it no matter who speaks against you, no matter the odds, no matter what
they say to or about you, no matter what roadblocks they throw in your
way.  What matters is that you remain true to your vision.

      On the other hand, for the reviewers and the pundits and the
critics and the net-stalkers who have done nothing but rag on this show
for five years straight, it is also a giant middle finger composed of
red neon fifty stories tall, that will burn forever in the night.

      In billiards, we call that a bank-shot.

                                                                  jms
