<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Jeff Sigh Corps - Pat Tallman Division Great Maker huh?

"Personally, I'm quite amazed that he and the rest of the cast were
able to keep themselves from spouting off on the last day in
Blackpool."

      More or less.  I was talking to Julie Caitlin Brown the other
day, who commented that she saw Bruce shortly after learning of
Claudia's decision, and he was upset, angry, nearly in tears over the
whole thing.  A lot of people in the cast were very upset over her
decision.

                                                                  jms
