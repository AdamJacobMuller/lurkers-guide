<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; If "Deconstruction" was written as a hedge against the fifth
&gt; season not being produced (as indicated in another comment),
&gt; doesn't it disrupt the original story line? Where would the fourth
&gt; season have ended if TNT had renewed the series earlier?

"lt writing a 5-year series if you're left hanging at the end of every
season. If "Deconstruction" was written as a hedge against the fifth
season not being produced (as indicated in another comment), doesn't it
disrupt the original story line?"

      You've got it backward; "Deconstruction" was written AFTER we
got word about the S5 renewal.
