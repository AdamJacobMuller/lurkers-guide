<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; What was the insignia on the Human "vorlon" ship as it apparently
&gt; went with humanity beyond the rim? Is there a need for symbols in
&gt; 1,000,000 years? Do the humans take their social grouping needs
&gt; beyond the rim?

      It's a Ranger symbol.

                                                                  jms
