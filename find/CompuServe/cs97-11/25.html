<H2>B5 Sierra software?</H2>
<h3>Date: 04 Nov 1997 22:11:02 -0700</h3>
<pre> George N. Ortiz &lt;110060.613@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I think I already know the answer to this question but will ask
&gt; it for the people who are not masochists and have Macintosh's;
&gt; When will a Mac version of the B5 CD-Rom come out? I imagine a
&gt; year after the Windoze version?

      The mac and pc versions of the B5 informational CDrom should be
out at the same time; they were designed for both platforms going in.

      They should be for sale around the 15th or so.

                                                                  jms
