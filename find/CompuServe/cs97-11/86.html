<pre> Roseann &lt;103510.1542@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; How much longer do you shoot for?
&gt; When do you break for the holidays and for how long?
&gt; How much is left of the shooting season when you come back?

      We'll be off for Thanksgiving weekend, then we shoot until
December 19th, which takes us through 514.  We're on hiatus until
January 2nd, then we come back and shoot 515-522 (actually the 21st
episode of S5 since 422 is now 522 and 501 was made 422), wrapping
production on March 20th.  Then we take a few weeks off to let the cast
and crew catch their breath, and shoot the third TNT TV-movie in April.

                                                                  jms
