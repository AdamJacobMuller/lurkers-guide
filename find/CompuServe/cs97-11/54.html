<pre> Gardner L. Harris &lt;76657.3333@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; You've got that too Joe?

      Yeah, I've got the last of it, and that was a big part of it,
the total and absolute fatigue.  Combined with only getting a few hours
sleep here and there, it's kinda taken a toll, but fortunately I'm at
the tail end of the thing finally, and should be back up to snuff in a
few days.

                                                                  jms
