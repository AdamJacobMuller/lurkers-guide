<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; is a good example?

      Actually, I was watching a debate on PBS a few weeks ago, and
they made the point that Christianity may have been the *cause* of the
fall of the Roman Empire, rather than its saving grace...apparently it
began to take the church structure as its own model in how to operate
(when its own infrastructure began to collapse), and put religious
leaders into positions they should never have occupied for reasons of
simple incompetence, and in short order things began to fall apart.

      I wish I could've made that paragraph more sensible, but I was
writing while listening, and I only got the sense of it...perhaps
someone else out there who heard it can fill in the gaps, but that's
the gist of the idea.

                                                                  jms
