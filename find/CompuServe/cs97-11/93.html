<pre> Neil S. Turkenkopf &lt;102664.3532@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Any comments,suggestions?

      Send a note to reelkosh@aol.com with the full info, and it'll be
taken care of.

      BTW, the B5 emporium received 100+ orders in just the first 24
hours of operation, without any real publicity about it.  And all
orders went out the very next day.

                                                                  jms
