<H2>New B5 Logo on Ace Awds</H2>
<h3>Date: 01 Nov 1997 22:26:07 -0700</h3>
<pre> Rebecca Eschliman &lt;76072.2345@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is it possible that the Cable Ace awards are taking place this
&gt; weekend but being televised at a later date? I could find no
&gt; reference to them for this weekend in the TV Guide (and what with
&gt; chasing B5 eps all over the schedule one becomes a rather intent
&gt; reader of TV Guide &lt;g&gt;)?

      I think it's next week, I screwed up.

                                                                  jms
