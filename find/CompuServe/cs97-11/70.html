<h3>Date: 14 Nov 1997 12:20:00 -0700</h3>
<pre> Jan Robb &lt;110543.731@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Has there been any more word?
&gt; Does anyone know when that will be???
&gt; Will these be available through the Fan Club, as well?

      The card game should be out shortly; the Sierra CD rom will be
available via retail, from Sierra directly, and from the B5 fan club at
a discount to members (and generally to non-members).  We should have
it in hand by the first of next week.  Keep an eye on the B5 fan club
website for more information (www.thestation.com), which will shortly
have an on-line credit card emporium to make ordering simpler.

                                                                  jms
