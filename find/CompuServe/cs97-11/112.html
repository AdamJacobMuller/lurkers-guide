"What was needed was at least talk of a major Mars resistance attack
occuring at the same time to draw off the security."

      There was.  Go back to the scene on the Apollo when the first
word of attacks comes in...it says specifically that they're hitting a
number of places *including* a White Star hitting that particular base.

                                                                  jms
