<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Is Sheridan the "One Who Will Be" because he stops the
&gt; Vorlon/Shadow war and ends the reign of the First Ones? Is it
&gt; because he is the founder of the new Interstellar Alliance? Or is
&gt; there yet another (currently unrevealed) reason? Did Zathras see
&gt; the founding of the new Alliance, or just the end of the
&gt; Vorlon/Shadow war? Does "The One" take on a different meaning
&gt; beyond the Sinclair/Valen-Delenn-Sheridan trilogy in the
&gt; *future*?

1.  Is Sheridan the "One Who Will Be" because he stops the
Vorlon/Shadow war and ends the reign of the First Ones? Is it because
he is the founder of the new Interstellar Alliance?  Or is there yet
another (currently unrevealed) reason?

      That's part of it, and what he grows into.

2. Did Zathras see the founding of the new Alliance, or just the end
of the Vorlon/Shadow war?

      I think he had a sense of it.

3.  Does "The One" take on a different meaning beyond the
Sinclair/Valen-Delenn-Sheridan trilogy in the *future*?

      Depends on how you look at it.

                                                                  jms
