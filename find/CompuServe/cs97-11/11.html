<pre> Jose Cabanillas &lt;71020.3316@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Second - will we ever see Major Morris again?
&gt; Actor problems?

      The other teep was an extra, and extras generally go uncredited,
and there wasn't time to work in the other Major at this point.

                                                                  jms
