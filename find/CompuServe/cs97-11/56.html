<pre> Stephen Burrow &lt;70640.40@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; doing as the Vorlons and Shadows did when they left the galaxy,
&gt; and destroying their home planet to prevent the younger races
&gt; from obtaining their technology? Also, I have seen it suggested by
&gt; others, but not confirmed by you: were the humans in fact leaving
&gt; the galaxy, or simply relocating? Stephen Burrow

      No point in leaving the galaxy; stars go nova, it only affects
the immediate vicinity (big as that is).  By this point, they were in
the position of the Vorlons, and now have to take their (our) place
guiding the younger races, the next wave, while not getting in the way
and remembering the lesson of the shadow/vorlon conflict.

                                                                  jms
