"I think one of the problems in N. Ireland is some people hold a
grudge for way too long."

      Granted.

      I was talking to one of the guys who worked on the shoot for
"The Quiet Man," filmed in Ireland.  At the end of the shoot, they were
going to have a huge wrap party, all the stars, crew, studio folk, the
whole bit.  A big deal, lots of money.  The guy was setting it up
through his aide over the phone from England, and after everything was
all set, just a few days before, he called himself just to make sure
everything was going ahead on schedule. The person in Ireland said it
was all fine, and could he have the name of the person to whom he was
speaking?

      "Cromwell," the guy said.

      They canceled the whole thing the instant he said that name.

                                                                  jms
