<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; What scenes, if any, have you written in reference to that?
&gt; IOW, what have you written that takes advantage of the lack of
&gt; censors?

      Mainly it's been in terms of the violence and language...I don't
think we ever could've done G'Kar's whipping scene on network TV, for
instance.

      What I was thinking of at the time I said it, though, was the
sudden realization that I could have Cartagia talking to a bunch of
heads on his desk....

                                                                  jms
