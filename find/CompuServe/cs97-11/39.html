<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Can you please give me any insight on this book?
&gt; PS, What was Jason Carter's reaction to his character being
&gt; killed off?

      Kathryn's the big fan of Marcus Aurelius, though I'm familiar
with his work.  I can't recall offhand which part she was referring to,
though, but will ask.  (She tends to quote him to me all the time...I
think she's working on my moral and ethical development.)

                                                                  jms
