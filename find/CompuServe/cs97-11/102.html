<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Did the sign actually say "ingloria?"

      It does say gloria...sorry, I had a brain-fart...see, there's a
famous New York Times headline pun that appeared the Monday that the
subways went on strike that slips into my brain whenever I write the
original latin version; the headline read SICK TRANSIT, INGLORIOUS
MONDAY.

      It's like one of songs you get in your head and it won't go
away.

      (The other famous Latin pun they did was on a building being
demolished, which read EDIFICE WRECKS.)

                                                                  jms
