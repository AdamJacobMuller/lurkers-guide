<pre>{original post had no questions}

"Neroon's description of it "We fight, they work, you pray." was
lifted whole from the church's description of proper societal roles.
You took it word for word (which I assume was the intention)."

      Actually...no, I wasn't even aware of that until you mentioned
it just now.  But I can see how it would fit.

                                                                  jms
