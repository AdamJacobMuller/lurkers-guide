<pre> Lenier &lt;101671.630@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Also have you noticed that teh Babylon website has not been
&gt; updated for 3 months?

      The Warner Bros. B5 site hasn't been updated, but the main B5
fan site, www.thestation.com is constantly being updated.  If you
haven't gotten your stuff yet, send a note to reelkosh@aol.com and
it'll be taken care of.

                                                                  jms
