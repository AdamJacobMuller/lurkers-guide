<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Will TNT be promoting the actors who did not survive the entire 5
&gt; year arc in their ads? WIll they be involved in any active TNT or
&gt; Babylonian promotions? Where's Zack?
&gt; Where's Draal?

      Funny thing is, while re-editing the pilot this afternoon, there
was Sinclair saying, "Babylon 5 is more important than any of her crew,
am I CLEAR?"

"Will TNT be promoting the actors who did not survive the entire 5
year arc in their ads?  WIll they be involved in any active TNT or
Babylonian promotions?"

      Dunno...will be getting a clearer view of this in the coming
weeks.

                                                                  jms
