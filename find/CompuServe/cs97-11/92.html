<pre> Shane Shellenbarger &lt;104305.3404@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Joe, Is the voice-over on the TNT ad's being done by Ken Nordine
&gt; of WORD JAZZ fame?

      I've actually no idea, TNT produced them and I didn't get that
info.

                                                                  jms
