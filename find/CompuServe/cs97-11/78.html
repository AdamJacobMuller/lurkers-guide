<pre> Jan Robb &lt;110543.731@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Was it really there somewhere?

      Sigh...here's the situation.

      I am an idiot.

      I was told they wanted the clip for the Cable Ace Awards.  And
they did. And it was shown.  But apparently it went out on the
*unbroadcast* night, the day before, rather than the one they aired. 
They wanted to split up the B5 stuff for maximum result, so thaty had a
clip on the non-broadcast night, and Bruce for the broadcast night.

      Me, I'm just in perpetual night.

                                                yrs, the idiot,
                                                                  jms
