"The fight work pray cycle representing Knights, Serfs and Clergy and
written *word for word* as Neroon said it is about *eight hundred*
years old.  I'll see if I can dig up an exact reference. I was certain
you cribbed it from the Dominicans."

      Nope...though the knights/serfs/clergy thing makes sense in that
context of work/serve/pray.  It's also warrior/worker/religious caste. 
It just kinda made sense when I thought it up.

      So now I have to figure out if I'm ahead of my time or behind my
time....

                                                                  jms
