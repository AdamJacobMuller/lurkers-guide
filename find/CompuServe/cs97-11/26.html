<pre> Neil S. Turkenkopf &lt;102664.3532@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Do you by any chance sell prepaid admission tickets for the next
&gt; one? One of the things I was gonna ask you,is: How's your back?

      The back is better, though I'm being careful.

      Now if only I could get over the last of the Martian Death
Flu....

                                                                  jms
