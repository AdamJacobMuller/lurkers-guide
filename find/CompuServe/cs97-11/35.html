<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Will you be the same when you go big business?
&gt; Will you remeber to call home?

"Will you be the same when you go big business?"

      I suppose one could make the argument that I'm already "big
business" since the show is on worlwide and there's so much going on:
figures, models, books, soundtracks, you name it....

      But to your question....I'm too old and cranky to start changing
now. I is what I is.  Which is as scary a thought as I'm allowed to
have on medication....

                                                                  jms
