<pre> Roseann &lt;103510.1542@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; When you create a character for a book, is it different when you
&gt; create it for TV? When creating a character in a book, because
&gt; you're not going to see it on the screen, you would tend to be
&gt; more descriptive, yes? Does this make any sense?

      No, no difference at all, from my perspective.  You find out who
the character is, what they want, how far they'll go to get it, and how
far someone else will go to stop them...and the rest attends to itself.

                                                                  jms
