"Fatigue Psychosis, obviously!   YOU MUST SLEEP NOW...."

      Boy, don't I know it...worked all weekend on 515, "Meditations
on the Abyss," finished it at 2 a.m. last night (Sunday night/Monday
morning), turned my attention to finishing the outline for the second
B5 novel in the Psi Corps trilogy coming out next year from Del Rey
until 4 a.m., then from 4-4:45 a.m. viewed the director's cut of 510
and made my notes so I could go in this morning, getting up at 9 a.m.
to do my producer's cut.

      I hate Mondays.

                                                                  jms
