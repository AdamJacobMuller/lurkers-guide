<pre> Carl Cantarella &lt;105030.3700@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Does it connect anywhere?

      The TNT site is not ready for anyone, and the information should
not have been released; they're just trying out the software, and the
log-ons are causing them problems (and some annoyance).  Please (to all
looking on) hold off on the TNT site until it's ready; there's nothing
there yet.

                                                                  jms
