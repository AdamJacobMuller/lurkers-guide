<pre> Koslosky &lt;102365.2062@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; What say ye?
&gt; If you have time, after watching this ep half a dozen times, what
&gt; were you attempting to convey?

      Your friends should understand that the actors credits are
always given in an episode; so no, that wasn't Jason.

                                                                  jms
