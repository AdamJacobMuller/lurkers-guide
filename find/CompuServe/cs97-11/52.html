<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; What period is the book you just cited about?
&gt; I'd bet it was from Roncesvalles (sp?) to the Rennaisance, or
&gt; maybe 1000 to 1500? In your reading about medieval England, did
&gt; you get Georges Duby's "William the Marshall?"

      You're correct; the part where the money got to be bigtime for
the church was in the 13th-15th centuries.  That was where the saint
business went bigtime, to the point where the church bosses had to
start hammering the local branches where the saints were getting too
powerful, and began creating challenges to the main line of authority.

      I love the competition that broke out among them...some saying
that their saint was better at miracles than the one down the road, and
if you're stupid enough to *go* to the one down the road, why, things
could actually get worse for you....

                                                                  jms
