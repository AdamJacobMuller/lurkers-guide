<pre> Jan Robb &lt;110543.731@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Were these two on your wish list or were they suggested by
&gt; someone else? Is there something that they've done that I/we know
&gt; about?

      Their name came up in discussions, and they just seemed a
perfect match.

                                                                  jms
