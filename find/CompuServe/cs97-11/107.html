<pre> Roseann &lt;103510.1542@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Any coffee houses, hole-in-the-wall restaurants with really good
&gt; food, anything like that you can recommend we check out?

      For hole-in-the-wall, try Salome Indian Restaurant at the corner
of Magnolia and Lankershim in Studio City...what I like about it is
that it doesn't back up and bite you an hour after eating it, which
(for me) a lot of Indian food does, though I'm very fond of it
nonetheless.  You don't go for the decor, but the food is great.  Try
the Chicken Tikka, the meat samosa for appetizer, or the Dal soup, the
Beef or Chicke Korma, Poori bread, maybe some nice vegetable biryani. 
I tend to eat there regularly.  (Another terrific Indian restaurant is
Taj Majal on Ventura Boulevard in Encino, around the 16000 block or so.
They do a mango-corn chowder that's terrific, and just about everything
else is good as well.)

      For Chinese, the Panda Inn in Glendale, at Wilson and Brand. 
They turned into a chain, but this is one of the original Panda Inns,
and the food is spectacular.  I recommend the Lemon Chicken, the Hot
Braised Sliced Fish, the Panda Beef (crispy, very nice), the Crab/Corn
soup, and if you like shrimp, the walnut shrimp is very nice.

      For coffee shops, Priscilla's in Toluca Lake (all these
references are in the Valley...I don't get out much) near Riverside and
Hollywood Way is a common hangout for studio types, and the Horseshoe
Cafe on Ventura near Van Nuys Boulevard is a trendy college place. 
Both make great mochas.

      Beyond that, I don't tend to go to clubs or trendoid places, I
stay home and I write.

                                                                  jms
