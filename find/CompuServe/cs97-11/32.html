<pre> Craig M. Bobchin &lt;102354.3246@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; My question, in light of the events of DoFS, is, isn't the climax
&gt; of Crusade a foregone conclusion? I mean won't knowing how it will
&gt; end ruin the suspense for people? But are there that many people
&gt; who would feel the same?

      I don't think it's anticlimatic at all; putting on our logic
hats for the moment, do you really think that I intend to wipe out all
of humanity and decimate the earth in Crusade?  No.  In any show, this
is going to be a given, the question is how do you *get* there?  The
premise exists to push us out on a mission...it's what happens in
pursuit of that mission that's going to be especially interesting.

      As with Londo/G'Kar, you saw them strangling each other...but it
was in the learning of *how* and *why* this happened that the fun
started.

                                                                  jms
