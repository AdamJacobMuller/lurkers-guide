<pre> Schmulenson &lt;72447.224@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I have a couple problems with deconstruction- I watched it twice
&gt; and still can't figuer out how the future was transmitted? was it
&gt; a sheridan dream and not a real future? The time periods seemed
&gt; disjointed perhaps it needed two or three programs to develop? 
&gt; There is also the one who is to come in the Grey council's circle
&gt; of Naroon?
&gt;  Phyllis

      The future wasn't being transmitted back; we were seeing the
records of the past from the point of view of the final character, one
million years hence, who has come to collect them prior to the final
chapter in Earth's history.
