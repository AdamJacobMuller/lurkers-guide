<pre> Michael Beemer &lt;71551.1670@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is this what was intended - in the passage of time this became
&gt; only routine? Was the line played the way you intended?
&gt;  - Was the incident 500 years earlier the "Great Burn" Theo is
&gt; helping Earth recover from? Could one speculate that the "Great
&gt; Burn" affected Earth terribly, but not all the colonies?
&gt;  interstellar community?)

      Yes, it was mainly Earth that bore the burden of the great Burn,
and yes, that was the one Garibaldi got into....
