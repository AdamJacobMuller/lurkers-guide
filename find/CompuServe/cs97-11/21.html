"Well it's been a great ride and I have used up a lot of pantyhose!"

      Then I will be brief.

"What if anything do you have in store for us series or movie wise in
the future?"

      Well, there's Crusade (the follow-up series), the B5 prequel,
the 2nd B5 TV movie ThirdSpace, a third TNT movie now in development,
and several other series notions I have in various stages of
development, a couple of novels I'm working on, a play, WB wants to
talk about a B5 feature film....

      Other than that, not much.

                                                                  jms
