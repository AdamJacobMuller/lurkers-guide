<pre> Ronald Legro &lt;75136.2066@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Three-camera setup?
&gt; Or just a well-done sim?
&gt; The female senator?

      Stephen filmed that sequence by having all of the cast on the
set at the same time, running multiple film cameras to get each version
"live."

                                                                  jms
