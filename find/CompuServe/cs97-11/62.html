<pre> Paul McElligott &lt;70007.3154@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; How can you say no to someone who has such big sad brown eyes?
&gt; ...are you going to stand for sort of thing?!

      There's nothing I can possibly say about that tribute that could
not be better said in open court before a jury.

                                                                  jms
