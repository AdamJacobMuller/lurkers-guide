<H2>New B5 Logo on Ace Awds</H2>
<h3>Date: 02 Nov 1997 19:45:13 -0700</h3>
<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;75063.3305@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; The Ace Awards have honored such genre shows as The Outer Limits,
&gt; if I'm not mistaken, so am I right in thinking that they might be
&gt; more open than the Emmys to considering B5 for the more
&gt; first-tier awards such as acting, writing and directing?

      I think we'll have better shots at everything, across the board,
once we're over on TNT.

                                                                  jms
