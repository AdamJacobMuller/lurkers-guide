<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; If WB is involved in making production decisions, why don' t they
&gt; carry the show in their primary market? Is this a marketing
&gt; decision, or was 5 years the predetermined duration of the
&gt; original story line?

      B5 was always designed to be, and announced as, a 5 year story.

"If WB is involved in making production decisions, why don't they
carry the show in their primary market?"

      I don't know what you mean here by "primary market," since
"market" is usually taken to mean a particular area or region, so the
term is being used here incorrectly.  If you mean syndication, the
influx of new shows and the other mini-networks has chewed up available
time-slots...and remember, TNT is now owned by WB, so one could argue
about what is now their "primary" venue.

                                                                  jms
