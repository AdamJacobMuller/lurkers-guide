<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; First, since "War Without End" takes place AFTER "Interludes",
&gt; wouldn't Kosh have already known that he was destined to die on
&gt; that day (learning this from the "history of the future")? Knowing
&gt; that his death was necessary AT THAT VERY MOMENT, why be so rough
&gt; with Sheridan when Sheridan was playing the part that he always
&gt; had played and always would play? Second, if Kosh didn't know that
&gt; he had to die *that night*, was he really planning to go to
&gt; Z'ha'dum with Sheridan later? What was he planning to do there?
&gt; What could he have accomplished on the Shadow homeworld?
&gt; Was he planning to speak to Lorien?
&gt; Were/are we ever going to find out what that was?
&gt; And third (and the most puzzling), if the Vorlons only know the
&gt; "future" up to the time Sinclair goes back in time, how did Kosh
&gt; know that Sheridan was going to die at Z'ha'dum?

      Kosh may have known that this moment would come, but knowing the
price that he would almost certainly have to pay...it wasn't easy, and
one can forgive Kosh for his outburst.  I think, in the end, he was
afraid, for a moment, a human thing...but he did what was necessary.

                                                                  jms
