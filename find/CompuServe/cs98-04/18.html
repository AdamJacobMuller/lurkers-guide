      Thanks...and yeah, I want it to be as much on the edge as B5,
but in a slightly different way.  Why can't an SF show be as much on
the cutting edge in its storytelling as a Homicide or NYPD Blue?  So
I'm going to gradually start playing with the format, and see where it
takes me.  If it ain't gonna be better than what we did before, ain't
much point to doing it....

                                                                  jms
