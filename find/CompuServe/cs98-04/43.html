      I don't consider it a mistake at all...you never heard much of
other Psi Cops talking about Bester, and they would have more knowledge
of him than anyone else.  As with Dirty Harry, some of the other
officers above and below him liked him...and he scared the crap out of
others.  Same here.

                                                                  jms
