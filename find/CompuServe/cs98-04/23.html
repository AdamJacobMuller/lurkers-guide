<pre> Anita Karve &lt;73653.3253@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Any chance Kathryn Drennan will be one of those writers?

      It's something I've discussed with her...if she comes up with a
story she wants to tell, she's said she'll do one.

                                                                  jms
