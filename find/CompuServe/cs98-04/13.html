      The phrase "A Call to Arms" goes back several centuries, and is
not owned by anyone, DS9 did not invent it.  You can only "rip off"
something that is specific to that item or thing; if they came up with
a title "Chief O'Brien's Hairdresser Dreedle," and we used that, then
you'd have a point. But this is, frankly, a case of fan myopia.

                                                                  jms
