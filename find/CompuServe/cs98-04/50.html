<pre>{original post had no questions}

      Of his previous titles, I suggest SHATTERDAY, DEATHBIRD STORIES,
or STRANGE WINE, all of which are available at any decent SF bookstore.
(His stuff is also being reprinted in the Edgeworks volumes.)

                                                                  jms
