<pre> Ian Clasper &lt;113131.2620@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Do you have strict guide lines saying "Advert every 10mins" for
&gt; instance , or is it a bit more free form ?

      It's not free-form, but it's not by the minute, either.  We have
an overall running time of about 42 minutes (plus credits), and that
gets divided into teaser, 4 acts and a tag.  The duration of those
varies; an act can be 8 minutes or 12, as long as the aggregate is
within the limits.

                                                                  jms
