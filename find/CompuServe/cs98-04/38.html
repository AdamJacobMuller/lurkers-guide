<pre> Carl Cantarella &lt;105030.3700@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Joe, This has been bothering me on and off for a good two weeks
&gt; now, so I've simply got to ask you if an article published in the
&gt; April 6th Issue of National Review, titled "Babylon, California"
&gt; written by Rob Long refers to you or not?

      To my knowledge, I've never spoken with Mr. Long, so that kind
of narrows down the possibilities.

                                                                  jms
