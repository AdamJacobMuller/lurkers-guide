<H2>Crusade Confirmed</H2>
<h3>Date: 06 Apr 1998 12:19:07 -0700</h3>
<pre>      Today the news hit: CRUSADE: THE BABYLON PROJECT (a new series
set in the B5 universe) is a go for production starting July 27th, to
go on the air January 6th on TNT.

      Also: if you can get a copy of tomorrow's Hollywood Reporter, do
so: they have dedicated the issue as a special B5 issue, and there is
going to be a lot of coverage of the show.  The issue will almost
certainly become a hard-to-find item in future, and is a testament to
the success not only of the show, but recognition within the industry
of what we've done to improve the way television is made.

                                                                  jms
