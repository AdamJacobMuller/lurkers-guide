<pre> Anita Karve &lt;73653.3253@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; How do you find outside writers?
&gt; You're a fan of his and vice versa, but for other potential
&gt; writers do you solicit resumes/writing samples/outlines?

"With Neil Gaiman, it was obvious. You're a fan of his and vice versa,
but for other potential writers do you solicit resumes/writing
samples/outlines?"

      Usually, I know the writer's work, so it's just a matter of
getting them in and handing them a premise (or in some rare cases,
asking them to come up with a story pitch).  If it's someone whose work
I don't readily know -- and this is rare for me to do on a first
season, when I know that every episode has to kick -- I'll call the
person's agent and get some samples of their prior produced work.

      Since there are only 11 available slots for this season, that
doesn't leave a lot of room right off the bat, and I have about 6-7
writers in mind for the rest, so it's already close to being locked
down before we've even started.

                                                                  jms
