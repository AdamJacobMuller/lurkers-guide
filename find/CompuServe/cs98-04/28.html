<pre> Carl Cantarella &lt;105030.3700@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; ;) Still, do you _ever_ just sit back to smell the roses or watch
&gt; a sunset?

"Still, do you _ever_  just sit back to smell the roses or watch a
sunset? I find myself wondering where you would find the time."

      I would like to, some time...my fantasy is having just one day,
to go out and do nothing...no deadlines hanging over my head...no
frenzied phone calls from actors or agents or studios or networks...I
realized how much I'd like this when I was writing Londo's speech in
"In the Beginning," about giving anything for just five minutes on a
beach...and I realized that it wasn't entirely just Londo talking.
