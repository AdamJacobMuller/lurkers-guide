<pre> Craig M. Bobchin &lt;102354.3246@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Mall stop this weekend?
&gt; Has he cancelled, or was never a positive to go?

      No, at this point it's Jerry Doyle, then Rick Biggs, then Jason
Carter on Saturday from 12-3:30 or so, then on Sunday it's Tracy, Peter
and (I think) Jeff from 12-3:30, both at the Glendale Galleria.

                                                                  jms
