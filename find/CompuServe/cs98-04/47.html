<pre> David Crader &lt;104635.1044@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Will we see THIRDSPACE before this, or is that going to be held
&gt; for a prime-time fall spot, leading into the "final five"?

      ThirdSpace will air July 19th, with The River of Souls airing
November 22nd.

                                                                  jms
