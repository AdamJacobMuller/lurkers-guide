<pre> Carrie Foreman &lt;76400.1170@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I know you pay actors a second time when previous footage is
&gt; reused, is that true for the Season 5 opening credits, for Ed
&gt; Waser &amp; Walter K?

      Yeah, they get re-use fees every time.

                                                                  jms
