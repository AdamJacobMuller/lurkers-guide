<pre> Will Caraway &lt;73671.2434@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; So what I've been wondering is this: Did the Shadow's try to work
&gt; their evolutionary magic on the Vorlons and the other first ones
&gt; while they were still young races? Is this the explanation for
&gt; Delenn's statement that the first ones have battled the Shadows
&gt; over millions of years? Would this indicate that the Vorlons
&gt; stayed behind because they were the most militant of the anti-
&gt; Shadow faction or perhaps the race least able to evolve beyond
&gt; the eye for an eye concept?

      No, the shadows definitely didn't try their advancement routine
on the vorlons; they were cases of parallel evolution at similar
periods.

                                                                  jms
