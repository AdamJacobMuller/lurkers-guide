<H2>No more UK Fan Club ?</H2>

      The UK fan club was never "official."  They were never a branch
of the official B5 fan club.  We do not have, and have never had, the
authority to convey official status to ANY outside fan group, only WB
can authorize such things through an official license.  We were
concerned in that the UK group was being perceived as such by fans
there, some of whom had begun sending us (and me) email with complaints
or general notes about the UK fan club asking me to deal with it since
this was an officially sanctioned fan club, so it became important to
clarify that.  You cannot "disenfranchise" someone or something that
was never a part of the "franchise" (a term I hate) in the first place.

                                                                  jms
