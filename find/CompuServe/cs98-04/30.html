      Nah...occasional wistfulness notwithstanding, I wouldn't have it
any other way.  Understand that I'm in the best position imaginable:
people are paying me for something I'd have to do for free, because I
can't not write. I get to write, and tell my stories my way, and make a
decent living.  How much more can anyone ask for?  And with all that,
it seems inappropriate to complain about the hours.

                                                                  jms
