<pre> Anita Karve &lt;73653.3253@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is the Hollywood Reporter a general newsstand pub, or do you
&gt; pretty much have to be in LA or the biz to get it? Will you begin
&gt; working on casting very soon, or is that something for further
&gt; down the line?

      You can find the Reporter at many larger newsstands in big
cities.  And we won't get to any real casting until the first few
scripts are in-hand, so we know what we're getting into.

                                                                  jms
