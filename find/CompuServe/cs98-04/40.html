<h3>Date: 17 Apr 1998 21:26:04 -0700</h3>
<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; at the end was Sinclair referring to Catherine Sakai?
&gt; And if so did she arrive before or after he did?
&gt; CT, so what else is new?

      She arrived after.

                                                                  jms
