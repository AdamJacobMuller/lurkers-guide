<H2>Season 6?</H2>

      Vast amounts of your information are incorrect; WB owns B5, for
starters.  Additionally, TNT puts up a portion of the production
budget, WB puts up the rest, same as with any network show.  There was
some initial talk of a sixth season by some folks over there, but I
made it clear that this is a five year story, and it ends in five
years, and asked them to respect my wishes.  They did.

                                                                  jms
