<pre> Rebecca Eschliman &lt;76072.2345@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; You said it once yourself -- you write with passion, otherwise,
&gt; why bother?

      Absolutely, there's no question that I'm going to be hit by
those with an interest in hitting me on any side of these issues. 
Crusade would be done because I want to have some *fun* after doing 5
years of angst...so there are bound to be those who say it's selling
out because it's not the same as B5 in that respect...if I have a
primarily new cast, I sold out the old cast, if I have a primarily old
cast, I'm being afraid of change...if it's too much like B5 some will
complain, if it's too different some will complain....

      Which is why, at the end of the day, you can never let the
complaints (or, for that matter, the praise) tilt you one way or
another.  The only thing you can do is follow the small, still voice at
the back of your head that tells the stories, and write for yourself. 
If you write well, enough people will stay around to keep you on the
air...if you don't, they won't. That's always struck me as the fairest
bargain around.

                                                                  jms
