<H2>B5 Act Structure</H2>
<h3>Date: 12-May-96 13:58:20</h3>
<pre> Automedia, Inc. &lt;70530.2521@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is this something that's common in TV drama?
&gt; Have I just not noticed it before?
&gt; Or is this something uncommon that you've adopted?

      It's actually something I had to fight for; a number of folks at
WB weren't sure about the notion of using the tag (which you refer to
as the last act) in quite the way I use it.  So yeah, it's a bit off
the usual.

                                                                  jms
