<H2>&lt;&lt;Talia/Abbut Qs&gt;&gt;&gt;</H2>
<h3>Date: 05-May-96 22:01:45</h3>
<pre> Simon Grierson &lt;100407.2075@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Did Kosh know about the hidden personality within Talia Winters?
&gt; Does he simply distrust Telepaths?
&gt; Will he ever get to use this Data chrystal?
&gt; My memory seems to recall him giving the chrystal to Garibaldi ?
&gt; Abbut said somthing along the lines of "Nice doing business with
&gt; you Mr Kosh, A pleasure as allways" - did this mean Kosh has had
&gt; a lot of Telepaths scanned?
&gt;  - If so, did he know what Lyita knew - but didn't know what
&gt; Telepath was used, so had a number of them scanned?

      Kosh certainly knew more about her, and almost certainly her
second persona, than anyone suspected.

                                                                  jms
