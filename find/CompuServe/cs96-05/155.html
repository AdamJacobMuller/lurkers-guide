<pre> Timothy C Schell &lt;71174.2414@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; How was this fight different than the one we didn't see in "Signs
&gt; and Portents"? Were there more Shadows this time or are they
&gt; getting stronger? If Kosh did take out some Shadows, will more be
&gt; sent to Morden as replacements? Did Kosh project to Delenn, G'Kar,
&gt; or anyone else besides Sheridan during the fight? Did Garibaldi
&gt; ever get a chance to speak with Kosh about the Talia/Abbut data
&gt; crystal as hinted at in "Divided Loyalties"? Besides being
&gt; extremely old, was Kosh an average Vorlon or particularly special
&gt; in terms of strength, skill, or status?

To your questions:

1.  Kosh died fighting, I guess, and I'm also guessing that he took
some Shadows with him.  How was this fight different than the one we
didn't see in "Signs and Portents"?  Were there more Shadows this time
or are they getting stronger?

They were not initially prepared to kill him.  That was a territorial
or jurisdictional squabble.  This was retribution.

2.  If Kosh did take out some Shadows, will more be sent to Morden as
replacements?

He didn't.  Hurt 'em good, but didn't take them out.

3.  Did Kosh project to Delenn, G'Kar, or anyone else besides Sheridan
during the fight?

No.

4.  Did Garibaldi ever get a chance to speak with Kosh about the
Talia/Abbut data crystal as hinted at in "Divided Loyalties"?

Yes.

5.  Besides being extremely old, was Kosh an average Vorlon or
particularly special in terms of strength, skill, or status?  No other
ambassador on the station has demonstrated the clout back home to
sortie an entire fleet at a moments notice.  Delenn and Londo have only
called on forces from a particular faction in their polities.

He was certainly well regarded...one of the older of the vorlons.

                                                                  jms
