<pre> Dave Vincent &lt;75460.1133@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; By the by, I have been wondering, now that the War room is a full
&gt; time operation, are their others in the command staff to spell
&gt; Sheridan, Ivonova, and Delenn?

      Yes, the war room would have to have support personnel there
when the big guys are off having fun or sleeping.

                                                                  jms
