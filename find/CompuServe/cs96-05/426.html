<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Were these two events connected?
&gt; Was the Minbari warrior caste trying to change the *past*?

       No, they weren't trying to change the past, and that wouldn't
have done it.  There are always extremists in every caste, and Minbari
are no exception.

                                                                  jms
