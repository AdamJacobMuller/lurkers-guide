<pre> Toni Muller &lt;75223.1575@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Was that a Minbari in _shorts_ in the opening scenes of Minbar!?!
&gt; Where was Sinclair all those 900 years between his existence as
&gt; Valen and his birth as Jeffrey David Sinclair? Or was he nowhere,
&gt; existing only at the closing and opening of the loop, being born
&gt; in the future and dying in the past? When Zathras said he was 110
&gt; years old, was that human years or his own race's years?

      No, I don't believe anyone on Minbar was wearing shorts.  It's
not the season for that.

      As for Valen, he died about 900 years ago, our time.  He lived
to be well over a hundred years old.

                                                                  jms
