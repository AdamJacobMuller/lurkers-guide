      There probably wasn't a credit there because it was an
incidental voice rather than a recurring voice.

      The other Vorlon also sounded different because I directed
Ardwight in different inflections...literally stood there outside the
booth using my hand like a baton to indicate the rising and falling
inflections as he spoke, to give it a wave kind of sound.

                                                                  jms
