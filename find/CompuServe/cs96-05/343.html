<H2>&lt;WWE II Spoiler / Quest&gt;</H2>
<h3>Date: 24-May-96 00:15:26</h3>
<pre> Jonathan Kass &lt;74130.443@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; 1) Coincidence that the son of Delenn and Sheridan is named
&gt; David, Sinclair's middle name? some of our own religious figures
&gt; seem to vanish rather than die according to biblical stories...)? 
&gt; 4) On a lighter note, what brought Cousin Brucie to the Show?

      Cousin Brucie was a fan of the show and wanted to do it.

      Correct, Sheridan wouldn't know anything of what happened after
he blipped out of that future situation.

      As for David, remember that Sheridan's father is also David.

                                                                  jms
