<pre> Guntis Glinavs &lt;72411.1421@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Again there are a few inaccuracies - did 500,000 fans really show
&gt; up to a B5 con in England?

      Thanks for letting folks know; I just heard about it myself, and
am having a copy or two sent on to me for the files.

                                                                   jms
