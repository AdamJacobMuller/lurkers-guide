<pre> David Cerreta &lt;72630.3433@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; But the other you'll get asked a lot and so I'll ask it now: was
&gt; this always Sinclair's path and if it was, was it your intention
&gt; (originally) to reveal it much later in the show, say season 5?

      To the latter question...I think I'll hold off on commenting on
this for a while.

      Other than that...I'm happy you liked the episodes.  It's a good
point to go out on for the break.

                                                                  jms
