      I think the nature of the debate is using the wrong language
here; I think when people are saying I'm "open-minded" it's possible --
and I'm only suggesting this, not to put words in anybody's mouth --
that the word being searched for is actually "fair."  Am I open minded
about the possibility of deities?  No, in that you're correct.  Am I
fair and/or open-minded in the treatment of religions on the show, in
saying that for many people, it's a good thing *for them*?  I like to
think so.  And that may be what's under discussion.

                                                                  jms
