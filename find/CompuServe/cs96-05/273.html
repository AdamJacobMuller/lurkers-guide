<pre> Joe Salemi [ZD Net] &lt;72631.23@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I've been thinking about this quite a bit after I&amp;E, and it seems
&gt; to me that we may not have entirely realized what Kosh was saying
&gt; (no surprise, eh? On the right track?
&gt; Or derailed?

      Interesting speculations.

                                                                  jms
