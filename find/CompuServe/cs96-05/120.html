<pre> David Cerreta &lt;72630.3433@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Apparently every encounter suit is not the same, neh?
&gt; The message from Ivanova is beginning to come through
&gt; because...of the temporal rift AND because there was no guarantee
&gt; that the Whitestar would go 6 years into the past to save B4 from
&gt; the Shadow attack, right? Then was the vision Sinclair had of a
&gt; future B5 being attacked by a much stronger Shadow fleet a vision
&gt; (again) of an alternate future, where he never became ambassador
&gt; and remained on B5?

      Thanks, and yep, you nailed the timeline just right.

                                                                  jms
