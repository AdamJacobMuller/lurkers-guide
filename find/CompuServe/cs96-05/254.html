<h3>Date: 19-May-96 14:08:22</h3>
<pre> Mark D. Smith &lt;70254.107@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is my assumption that the different Minbari castes were on the
&gt; verge of destroying themselves prior to the war and the
&gt; appearance of Valen?

      There was certainly some division among Minbari; Valen
straightened a lot of that out.

                                                                  jms
