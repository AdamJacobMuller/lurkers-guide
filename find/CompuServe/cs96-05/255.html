<H2>WwE Part 1 Question</H2>
<h3>Date: 19-May-96 14:08:24</h3>
<pre> Mike Hoffmann &lt;100321.2604@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Had Sinclair stayed on as B5 commander, who would have been
&gt; zapped to Centauri Prime to confront Londo on the destroyed
&gt; Centauri Prime?

      I appreciate the questions, but there are so many alternate
timelines flying around right now...I'm not sure I want to further
complicate the issue.

                                                                  jms
