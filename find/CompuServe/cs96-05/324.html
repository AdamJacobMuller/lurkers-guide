<pre> Bruno Melancon &lt;102647.3222@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; How will you surprise us with the resolution of the Shadow War
&gt; since we already know we will win?

       It's a literary...I hate to say the word trick, but it's the
most descriptive.  You show somebody the end right off the bat, as we
did with the Londo/G'Kar scene.  But how do we get there?  What
happens?  Yes, the war is eventually won...but what *was* the price? 
And what does it mean to everyone involved?

       The best magic is when it's right there in your face, and you
can't see how it's being done.

                                                                  jms
