<pre> Daniel M. Upton &lt;75442.1331@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; If you were still the producer what are the chances that the last
&gt; episode of the series would have been about Jessica's friends
&gt; using Jessica's investigative techniques to solve Jessica's
&gt; murder?

      The odds of that story are about zip.  One doesn't do such
things to Jessica Fletcher.

                                                                  jms
