<pre>{original post had no questions}

      The real drag about Twin Peaks is that, apparently, as told to
me by some of the writers who worked on the show, they really had NO
idea where they were going.  They just kept throwing stuff out there. 
I was vastly disappointed.

                                                                  jms
