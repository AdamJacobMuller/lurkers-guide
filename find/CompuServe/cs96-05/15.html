<H2>season finale in October</H2>
<h3>Date: 05-May-96 22:01:56</h3>
<pre> Catherine Becic &lt;73414.2603@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is this set in stone?
&gt; Can nothing be done?
&gt; Must we really be tortured again?
&gt; And will the UK get the end of season 3 before we do again?

         I haven't heard this myself yet formally, so I really can't
comment until I know more.

                                                                  jms
