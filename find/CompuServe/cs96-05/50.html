      True, though the female version of this, as practiced in some
countries, is extremely debilitating and far more violent or severe. 
Much as we are all attached to our respective genitalia, I'd suggest
that snipping the foreskin is not quite so severe as taking a razor
blade and cutting OFF the clitoris and parts of the labia major, as is
done in some places.

      But you're right, the practice on either side is certain of a
piece (so to speak).

                                                                  jms
