      Let me answer this way...whenever I'm going to unveil something
on the show, I begin to point to it in upcoming episodes.  I've begun
pointing to the question of what the shadows want, and why they're
doing it.  So, logically, I'm now going to have to follow up on
that....

                                                                  jms
