      Actually, variations on that joke were told at a number of
conventions; it's the obvious one to go for, given that for a while the
"how many X does it take to change a lightbulb?" question was racing
all around the nets. There were literally hundreds of them; of which,
this or a variation on it was the most common one floating around...so
I let it go in as a nod to the nets.

                                                                  jms
