<pre> Celia J. Penham &lt;102454.540@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Ok, this doesn't have anything to do with the current message
&gt; thread, but has there been any thought about a B5 novel? I mean,
&gt; one that tells THE ENTIRE STORY?

      A lot of folks have suggested it...only time will tell if it
ever gets done.

                                                                  jms
