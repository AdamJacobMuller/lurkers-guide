<pre> Chris Croughton (UK) &lt;100014.3217@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Do you think that after this anything else will be a bit of a
&gt; let-down? Or is that why you want to get out of TV and do
&gt; something different, so you won't be competing with yourself?

      My sense about getting out of TV when B5 is over is that I feel
I'd've said most of what I want to say for television.  The only things
that could keep me in would be an anthology, or something right on the
cutting edge, something with which we could make another kind of
history.  But those don't tend to come around very often....

                                                                  jms
