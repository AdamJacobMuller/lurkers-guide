&gt; Have I got this right: Delenn saw John attempting to synch back
&gt; up so gave up her stabilizer for him; this caused her to become
&gt; unstuck and put her in the space suit so that Zathras could give
&gt; her the repaired stabilizer when she appeared later; Delenn was
&gt; "missing" from the time she stuck her head out of the hole until
&gt; Zathras gave her the stabilizer and no one noticed? How long was
&gt; B4 in the past before the Minbari showed up to search it? 
&gt; Obviously long enough for the 2 Vorlons to show up, but how long
&gt; was that?

       Yes, you're correct about the Delenn material; she left the
ship to do this, and not that much time had passed.  It was, in fact,
to check on Delenn that Marcus was coming out as well.

                                                                  jms
