<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Sheridan tells Kosh, "How do we know it's even you in that
&gt; encounter suit? Wow, is that foreshadowing or what?
&gt; * Is the last voyage or duty of Kosh's ship something we'll see
&gt; in more detail? * My husband wants to know if you're going to get
&gt; Dick Sergeant to play the new Kosh?

      Thanks; there's a lot in the episode that plays very well on all
the levels you mention.  A lot of meat there.

      As for Kosh's ship...it headed for the nearest star, the local
one, and basically dived into it....
