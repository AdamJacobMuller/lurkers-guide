<pre> Michael Beemer &lt;71551.1670@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Why would he?

      No, actually, there's a much simpler answer to the Ironheart
question than that.

      If we all remember the episode, he was trying as hard as he
could to control himself, lest his abilities tear the place apart.  He
was deliberately and with great pain trying NOT to use his abilities in
any way, manner, shape or form.  He was also in great physical pain,
was later shot, and became transcendent...which tends to kind of
distract one....
