<h3>Date: 20-May-96 03:48:53</h3>
<pre> Matthew D. Woudstra &lt;71073.540@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Where on earth did you get the inspiration for Zathras?
&gt; Was the character a product of your vision or what the actor
&gt; brought to the role...?

      Well, Zathras appeared in Babylon Squared, so you might have
seen him there.  Beyond that...no, the actor came to what was written
on the page and made it come to life, but didn't invent the character. 
I just sorta thunk him up.  It's what I do.

                                                                  jms
