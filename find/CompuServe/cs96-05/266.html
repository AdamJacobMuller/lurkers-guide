<H2>B5 Fan Club Stuff?</H2>
<h3>Date: 19-May-96 20:38:43</h3>
<pre> Chad Underkoffler &lt;102512.1310@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Joe, What's the word of Fan Club stuff?
&gt; And the Webpage?

      We're just awaiting final word from WB before releasing the fan
club web site; newsletters should be going out soon.  We're just
waiting until there's a slight lull in memberships so we won't have to
do too many multiple mailings.

                                                                  jms
