      Thanks.  The voice-over is something I mentioned here a few
months ago as a tool I was adding to my toolbox to use as counterpoint,
or segue, in ways I hadn't tried before.  I use it again here and
there, though the key with any new tool is not to go nuts and use it
all over the place when a better one, maybe the one you already had, is
better suited to the task.

                                                                  jms
