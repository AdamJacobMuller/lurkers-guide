<pre> Daniel M. Upton &lt;75442.1331@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; If you want to wait to answer this that's OK, but did the Minbari
&gt; *know* that Sinclare was going to become Valen when they backed
&gt; his assignment to B5? Is that what Delenn meant when she said she
&gt; knew that they were not wrong about him? And if that is the case
&gt; why was Delenn told to kill Sinclare if he remembered what
&gt; happened to him at the Battle of the Line?

      No, they didn't know at the time; most of them were still trying
to figure the whole damned thing out; some refused to accept it, and if
he was indeed bogus, wanted him killed to avoid becoming a false
prophet and undoing Minbari society; some *did* believe it was him. 
This disagreement in a sense became the first loose thread in
unraveling parts of Minbari society.

                                                                  jms
