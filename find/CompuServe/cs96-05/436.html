<H2>&lt;&lt;Time Travel Ques.&gt;&gt;</H2>
<h3>Date: 28-May-96 22:21:25</h3>
<pre> Larry Rosenblum &lt;72122.1555@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; What happens to the consciousness of the Sheridan of the future
&gt; while he is being "inhabited" by the Sheridan of the past? Does
&gt; the Sheridan of the future remember what has gone on?

      The future Sheridan would have a little memory of what happened
during that time, but it'd be almost dreamlike, two steps removed.

                                                                  jms
