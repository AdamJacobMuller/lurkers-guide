<H2>&lt;&lt;War Without End 1&amp;2&gt;&gt;</H2>

<pre> Julia E. Linthicum &lt;73114.3530@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; why does the image of Tennyson's Ulysses (Sinclair's favorite,
&gt; but equally appropriate to this commander too) growing old and
&gt; grey watching his friends and enemies disappear flash through my
&gt; mind? BTW, one quick question, what does the honorific used by
&gt; Marcus and Rathenn to Sinclair mean? And, were my eyes deceiving
&gt; me, or were those two Vorlons au naturel hovering over Valen?

      In a way, this question touches on the issue that got raised in
another thread here, about who's the "important" character.  We all
have the potential for importance, if we choose to exercise it, and
recognize the necessity of personal commitment.

                                                                  jms
