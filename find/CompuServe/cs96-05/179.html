<H2>&lt;War Without End, Pt 1&gt;</H2>
<h3>Date: 15-May-96 12:56:10</h3>
<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt;  - Isn't Delenn's sleeve different from the one shown in "Babylon
&gt; Squared"?
&gt;  - Why wasn't B5 destroyed?
&gt; Is it because the shadows knew they failed with B4 and so there
&gt; was no use in destroying B5?
&gt;  - Did the first three stations look similar to B4?
&gt;  - Why didn't Sinclair want Garibaldi along for the ride?
&gt;  - Is *Sheridan* The One?

       B5 wasn't destroyed because it wasn't the one that would be
taken back. Yes, the prior stations would've looked more like B4 but
they were sabotaged *very* early in the construction process.  You'll
learn why he didn't want Garibaldi along next ep.
