<H2>&lt;MFE Question&gt;</H2>
<h3>Date: 14-May-96 13:39:33</h3>
<pre> Stephen M. Demarest &lt;70674.1405@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Was Santiago president 8 years ago?
&gt; If so, was he (or his govt) working with the Shadows?

       No, Santiago wasn't involved with the shadows; certain elements
within his government, however, *were*.  Which was one reason why they
needed to get him out of the way.

                                                                  jms
