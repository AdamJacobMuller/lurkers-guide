<pre> Lynne Caulfield &lt;101647.2616@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Where did you get this information from?

      Yes, Mara is correct.  I'm an atheist.

      You got a problem with my personal beief system?

      Tough.  You don't get a vote.

      And if that's enough to make you not watch the show...well, the
problem is entirely yours.

      I leave my personal beliefs *out* of what I write for TV.  I
don't try to impose my attitudes or conclusions on others, or penalize
others for what they think.

      You ought to try it sometime.

                                                                  jms
