      Bottom line, Steven...what you're doing is applying not only
just Earth norms and standards of behavior to aliens, you're applying
distinctly Western modes of behavior, conduct and mentality.  You're
expecting them to think and act like we do, in the way we consider
logical.  You can't even apply that criteria to other countries right
here on Earth, let alone outside.  Is it logical to one day just walk
away from all your possessions, just leave them where they are, and
start walking, not coming back?  Here we consider that abnormal
behavior, abandoment...in Australia, among the Aboriginal culture, that
principle is called "walkabout" and is quite common and accepted 
behavior.  The idea of ritually mutilating a young woman's genitals is
a hideous, terrible notion to any sane person in this country...but in
many African nations, it's practiced quite commonly, on an everyday
basis as part of their notion of coming into womanhood.

      Part of having *alien* aliens is that they don't think like us. 
One big adjustment Americans rarely make when they go overseas is that
they expect everyone and everyplace to be just like home in attitude. 
But there are huge differences...and those differences can start wars.

                                                                  jms
