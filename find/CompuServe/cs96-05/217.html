<pre> Arline Williams &lt;102551.2346@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; How do you do it?

      Actually, the scary thing is...I wrote 12 the first year, 15 the
second, and 22 the third, so that's 49 out of 66 altogether.  That's
about 2,400 pages in 3 years, equal to 5 full-length novels.

      Suddenly I have the overwhelming urge to take a nap....

                                                                  jms
