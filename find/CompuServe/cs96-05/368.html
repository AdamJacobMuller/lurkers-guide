      David, you can say "it seems to me," but I'm telling you it
wasn't, not in relation to the scar.  And Sheridan wasn't a "backup"
for Sinclair, he was brought in specifically because I needed somene
who could and would do things in a different way, and had a different
arc.  If it was going to track 1-to-1 you wouldn't *need* a new
character.

      And the swipe Kosh took at Sheridan wouldn't be *nearly* enough
to cause a huge scar like that.

      You're connecting two unconnected incidents.

                                                                  jms
