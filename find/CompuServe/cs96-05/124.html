<pre> SysOp Lee Whiteside &lt;76711.2660@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Do they only include things that they get as part of a festival
&gt; or something or can some producer or studio offer them some tapes
&gt; to make available for viewing?

      I hadn't even thought about that aspect...it's certainly one
that should be pursued, I agree.

                                                                  jms
