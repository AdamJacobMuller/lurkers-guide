<H2>B5 in Millimeter Mag.</H2>
<h3>Date: 24-May-96 19:22:11</h3>
<pre>For those who want a really good picture of how we do this show, and
how we're ahead of the technology curve, making a bit of history with
how we do things here, this month's MILLIMETER MAGAZINE has a cover
story on B5's production methods.  (It's *the* trade magazine for tv
and film production.) If your local bookstore doesn't carry it, the
library might.
