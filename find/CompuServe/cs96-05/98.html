      The other thing to bear in mind is that I can't really be
responsible for what expectations you bring to it, since I can't see
inside your head. (Or if I could I wouldn't tell you...and stop that,
you'll go blind.)  All I can do is tell the story that's in my head.

                                                                  jms
