<h3>Date: 17-May-96 01:08:57</h3>
<pre> Mark D. Smith &lt;70254.107@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; OK, question though, how long ago (now being 2260 on B5) did
&gt; Valen live and come up with his ideas?

      Valen led the prior shadow war and formed the grey council
roughly 1000 years before B5's current time.

                                                                  jms
