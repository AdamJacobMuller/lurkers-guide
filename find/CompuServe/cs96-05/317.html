<pre> Cathy Holley &lt;75204.1515@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; If you saw a house in a forest, full of furniture, but made
&gt; entirely of foresty stuff, would you conclude that the house
&gt; formed on it's own? without a designer?

      Yes, I've heard the "looking at a house" notion...and I've also
noted the Rohrscharch test, in which you look at random drawings, and
the human mind, which seeks out patterns, takes that which has no
meaning and puts a meaning onto it.

                                                                  jms
