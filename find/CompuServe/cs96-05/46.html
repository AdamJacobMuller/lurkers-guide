<pre> Christian Vitroler &lt;100042.662@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Any comment on the frequent mangling in German episodes?
&gt; So you can wonder, if he (JMS) gives us the voice beyond any
&gt; doubt why doesn't he show us her? But is there no such thing as
&gt; sort of quality control from the Executive Producer? you're out
&gt; once and for all once it's sold?

      There is absolutely nothing I can do about this except be upset
by it.

                                                                  jms
