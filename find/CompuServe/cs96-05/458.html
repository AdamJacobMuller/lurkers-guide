"You hand this woman a script and say to her, "Miss C., everyone
around you is dead and you are in command.
        The station is falling down around you and you're in terrible
pain, about to die by decompression or laser burns or crushing--or
worse, you could become a Morden and be controlled by the Shadows the
rest of your life.
        You have no hope of rescue.
        You may not know where you are."
        And then you say she was a tiny bit on the hysterical side?"

      Hey...from where I sit, that's just another day at the office.

      Don't know many producer/writers, do you?

                                                                  jms
