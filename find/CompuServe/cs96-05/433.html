<pre> Larry Rosenblum &lt;72122.1555@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; If Delenn still has it in her quarters in 2260, having used it in
&gt; 2258/59, from where did Zathras get it in order to bring it along
&gt; to Babylon 4?

      From Epsilon 3.  It was on Epsilon 3, then taken into the past
with B4, held on Minbar until Delenn got it, and still has it.

                                                                  jms
