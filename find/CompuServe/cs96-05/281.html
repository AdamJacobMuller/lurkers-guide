<H2>Hypernauts Cancelled?</H2>
<h3>Date: 20-May-96 17:59:25</h3>
<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; If nobody else picks it up, is there any chance that the B5 fan
&gt; club could issue the completed episodes as videos?

      There's no relation between B5 and Hypernauts, and it would be
contractually impossible for us to do tapes of that show.  Still
trying to work out the B5 tapes at present.

                                                                  jms
