<pre> Mark D. Smith &lt;70254.107@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; PMJI, but around which episode will you reveal what the Shadows
&gt; really want and their reasons for their attacks?

      Toward the end of this season is all I'll say for now.

                                                                  jms
