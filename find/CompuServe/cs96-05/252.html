<pre> John M. Kahane &lt;102664.773@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Come to think of it, how's the business of renewal for Year 4
&gt; coming?

      No, it seems that WB is set on airing the last batch of
episdodes in October, to ramp up for the November sweeps, assuming
renewal.  We won't hear final word on this for another week or two.

                                                                  jms
