<pre> Toni Muller &lt;75223.1575@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; If that is so, then how did Morden know about her before he
&gt; talked with the man Vir made the arrangements with? Or was it
&gt; something else - something to do with Kosh? Is this because of
&gt; what she is hiding - like knowing what the Shadows want? How did
&gt; Kosh know what would happen to him if the Vorlons fought the
&gt; Shadows? Since he is the link between the Vorlons and the army of
&gt; light, did he simply realize that the Shadows would move to sever
&gt; that link, or is there more to it? And why couldn't Kosh
&gt; successfully defend himself? Was he outnumbered three to one, one
&gt; Shadow being equal in strength to one Vorlon? His response: "Why'd
&gt; you have to tell me that?

       The "crystals" were diamonds, he was bribing various people to
let him in and otherwise do things for him.  And yes, Delenn's holding
back some information still, and Kosh was outnumbered.

                                                                  jms
