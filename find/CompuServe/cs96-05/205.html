       I don't consider them a "rival," there's room enough for
everybody. The more the merrier.  We're glad to have them on.  As for
my personal view, I rather like the new Doctor.  He's probably the best
they've had since Tom Baker, who for me has always been the
quintessential Doctor.  There were some story lapses, and the female
doctor is a good performer but needs to be written less
annoyingly...but all the ingredients are there.  I hope they get 
approved to series; I'll be watching.

                                                                  jms
