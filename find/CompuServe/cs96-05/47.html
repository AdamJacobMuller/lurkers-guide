<pre> Scott Miller &lt;70562.3656@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Why would they not have their own names for this place--why does
&gt; everyone (seem to) universally use the Minbari name?

      No, it's not a Minbari name, any more than automobile is a
Spanish word, even though it's used in the Spanish language (albeit the
pronunciation varies just slightly).

                                                                  jms
