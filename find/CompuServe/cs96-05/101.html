<h3>Date: 11-May-96 22:28:02</h3>
<pre> John M. Kahane &lt;102664.773@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Now one could attribute this change in Lyta's abilities due to
&gt; the Vorlons (since she has undergone some changes), but are we
&gt; going to find out more about this and Lyta's abilities later this
&gt; season?

      It's fair to say that Lyta has been...aided, slightly, in her
abilities. But I'm not ready to pull the trigger on that one for a
while yet.

                                                                  jms
