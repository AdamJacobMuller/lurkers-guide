      Wow, thanks.  Great comments on it all.  Makes doing it
worthwhile.

      Re: vacation...I wish.  We're still doing post production, still
editing, mixing, spotting for music and sound...it's a long process
that will take us right through the prep time for year four, assuming
renewal.  I can grab a day here or there, that's about it.  And even
while awaiting word, I still have to begin working on year four
scripts.  (The tentative title for the first episode of year four is
"The Hour of the Wolf.")

                                                                  jms
