<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Anyway, was this Vorlon attack synonomous to Jimmy Doolittle's
&gt; raid on Tokyo in the early days of WWII? WHat exactly has Sheridan
&gt; learned as of now? Will Kosh's replacement become his mentor now?
&gt; a Vorlette?

      Sheridan has almost certainly not learned all he needed to know.

                                                                  jms
