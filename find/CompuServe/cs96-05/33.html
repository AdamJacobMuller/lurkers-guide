<pre> Trent K. Johnson &lt;71020.1052@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Geez, how many of Morella's "chances" did he blow *this* time?

       Thanks.  Yes, I don't think Sinclair would've handled that
scene in the same way; it needed someone who'd go toe to toe with
something very old and dark and dangerous in his way.  He had to get
under Kosh's "skin," as it were. Needle and outrage and upset him until
he got through...whatever the cost.

                                                                  jms
