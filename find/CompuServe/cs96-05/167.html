"The reason for the multiplication  of Old Testament laws was because
when Moses brought down the first ten the people promised to obey them
to God's satisfaction.  This proved that they had missed the point,
which was that God's law is impossible for man to keep to God's
standards because his standard is perfection and we are imperfect."

So in other words, this was sort of god's version of "pull my
finger...."
