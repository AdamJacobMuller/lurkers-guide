<pre> Rick Sharon &lt;76416.2213@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; would he?
&gt; would he?
&gt; Not even HE is that devious, is he?
&gt; could he??!?
&gt; he couldn't, could he?
&gt; will he?
&gt; (Hmmmm, B5 repair kit?
&gt; The newscaster wasn't visible "below the waist", was she wearing
&gt; hip-boots? are the Shadows consumers and we're just consumables?
&gt; He's a busy man, who has time for that sort of thing?
&gt; But, correction Sheridan, it's not "now we have a weapon", it's
&gt; "now we know what kind of weapon could work" - where is Sheridan
&gt; going to find an Army of telepaths? could you please arrange to
&gt; distribute/broadcast a new B5 episode every 2-3 hours? Whatever
&gt; were you thinking? DO YOU HEAR ME???
&gt; Anxiously looking forward to next episode (but, one week?

      Thanks for that...well, for *all* of that, as there was much
good stuff and kind words therein.  Just got in from Ohio, so I'm
bushed, but still very appreciative.

                                                                  jms
