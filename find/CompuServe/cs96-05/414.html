      Thanks.  That was the one thing I just didn't want to do,
disappoint the fans, as I'd been disappointed so many times *as* a fan.
We'll never be perfect, however much I try, there will always be
glitches, and more glitches, and sons of glitches, but we always work
to make it as good as humanly possible.  It's certainly the story I
always wanted to see, and hope that others feel the same.

                                                                  jms
