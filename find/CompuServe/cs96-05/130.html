"The "arc" is fully alive for you now, I think.  Without these
characters living and breathing inside your mind I don't see how one
man could write as much as you have over the past two seasons.  What I
*have* noticed is that all the actors now seem to be responding to the
story you're telling."

Yeah, it's kind of a funny thing...the deeper we got into the season,
as the actors saw only one name on script after script, and they began
to understand what was coming, and it's all *very* consistent...the
sense of this being a novel really came through for everyone in a very
profound way.  You could really feel a change in everyone's attitude,
though it'd be hard to put into words.  A sense of, "This is it, this
is the story, we're moving now, we're doing something nobody's ever
done."  They know how hard it is for anyone to write this many scripts,
which is why it's never been done before, and I think they not only
respected that, but felt they had to rise to the challenge and give
just as much at that end of it.  Usually you tend to hit a slump 
energy-wise in your third year; not here.  Everyone's just hitting all 
cylinders.
