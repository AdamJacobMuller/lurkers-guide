<pre> Chris Croughton (UK) &lt;100014.3217@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Joe, are there any other TV people who believe that?

      Yes, there are definitely other TV folk who feel that way;
difference is, you just don't hear about them a lot.

                                                                  jms
