<pre> Darran Williams &lt;101656.2143@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Do you know whether Channel 4 here in the UK have acquired the
&gt; Widescreen versions or not ?

      I don't believe the UK has acquired the widescreen versions, no,
otherwise they'd be playing them currently, as is the case in France
and Portugal.  What happens after the current run, I don't know.

                                                                  jms
