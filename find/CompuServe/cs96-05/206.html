<h3>Date: 16-May-96 16:37:39</h3>
<pre> Bernard F. Dowdy, J &lt;76550.347@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; .did you ever get any stick time in that part of the Wing
&gt; Commander universe?

       No, actually, I've never gotten into the Privateer stuff...I
have the new Wing Commander, but my joystick is screwed up (others have
made that observation before), so it's waiting until I can yank the
computer out of its niche and install the Fancy New Joystick I bought
that has fifteen thousand different plug-in points.

                                                                  jms
