<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; When will I no longer be confused?

      Well, the reason Delenn dropped the globe will be gone into by
the end of the season; as for "when will (you) no longer be confused?"
that's rather outside my purview.  Have you considered meditation?

                                                                  jms
