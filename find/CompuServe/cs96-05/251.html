<pre> Jonathan Hoopingarn &lt;73172.1065@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Dosen't this blow the mystery of whether Sheridan goes to
&gt; Z'ha'dum? Or would that event be later in his life than his going
&gt; to Centauri Prime? And are we going to find out why older-Sheridan
&gt; was on C-prime in the first place and not off someplace
&gt; collecting his pension? I guess the question might be what are
&gt; Minbari feelings about such things?

      Who said there was a mystery about Sheridan going to Z'ha'dum? 
Kosh seems to treat it as a fait accompli; so does Sheridan.  It seems
fated that he will go...the question is when, why, and under what
circumstances, with what results?

      See, sometimes the story works in the shadows (so to
speak)...and other times we're right out in the open, we hand you the
playbook and tell you we're coming right up the middle.  And *that's*
when you've got to really worry.

                                                                  jms
