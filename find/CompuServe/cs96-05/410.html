<pre> Michael Grabois &lt;74737.2600@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; And did we ever hear anything about the B4 crew that was
&gt; evacuated?

      Yeah, I know about the sleeve...and actually she didn't touch
him in WWE2.  It was one of those days when it was a hideous production
schedule, and I wasn't on set, and it slipped by everybody else.

                                                                  jms
