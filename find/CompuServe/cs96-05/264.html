<pre> Daniel M. Upton &lt;75442.1331@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; In the original version of the story where Sinclare stayed and
&gt; there was no Sheridan was Babylon 4 brought forward in time to
&gt; replace the destroyed Babylon 5? Was the ageing of Sinclare to
&gt; have been explained by the fact that he had given his time
&gt; stabilizer to Zathras? What did the Soul Hunter mean when he told
&gt; Sinclare "they are using you"?

      No, B4 was never intended to go forward in time.  The aging was
done pretty much as intended.  And the Soul Hunter meant they're using
him to create their old Leader.  Still tracks.  I'll have more to say
about all this after everyone's seen the episode.

                                                                  jms
