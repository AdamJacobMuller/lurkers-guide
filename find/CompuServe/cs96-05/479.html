<h3>Date: 31-May-96 00:19:13</h3>
<pre> Dimitri M LaBarge &lt;71501.3353@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Does that mean it would have been impossible for him to have
&gt; become unstuck in time and reappeared in, say, his own body ten
&gt; minutes after he was murdered?

      You hate me, don't you...?
