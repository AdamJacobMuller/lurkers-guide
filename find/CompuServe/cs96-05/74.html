<pre> John Lawless &lt;70262.363@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Since Kosh knew in advance that he would be Morden&amp;Co.'s target,
&gt; why didn't he prepare defenses? Or, failing that, why didn't he
&gt; get in his ship and leave for as long as Morden remained on B5?

      Because he knew a price had to be paid, and if it wasn't him,
it'd be someone else.  Because he knew there was no getting around it. 
He's too prideful to run.

      Remember Gethsemane....
