<pre> Bob Hodge &lt;74774.1747@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; One nagging question in my mind - Has Sinclair, Delenn, and
&gt; Sheridan gone too far?

      Thanks.  No, that's not it; you're right, it'd make the story
'way too convoluted.  But Delenn may have made some questionable
decisions at various points.

                                                                  jms
