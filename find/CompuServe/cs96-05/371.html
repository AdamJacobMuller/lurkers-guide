<pre> Gail Marsella &lt;71551.3200@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; These warm fuzzies of Delenn and Sheridan sleeping peacefully
&gt; together and having a child and winning the war and loving each
&gt; other for decades...JUST WHAT PRICE DO THEY PAY FOR ALL THIS??? 
&gt; Why do I get the impression it's going to be way too high?

      Depends on how you define "too high" a price.

      Oh, and yes...better stock up.

                                                                  jms
