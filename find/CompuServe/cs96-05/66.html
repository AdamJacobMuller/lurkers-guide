&gt; I mean, out of all the people on the ship, they just happen to
&gt; find the one person who is significant to Bester? I can see what
&gt; you wanted to do, but couldn't it have worked better if, say, he
&gt; had been brought a list of people who were in the ship?

      Yeah, they could've brought him a list...and he'd have seen the
name instantly, and wouldn't have been hit with his own "blip" careless
attitude right in his face...also, she needed to be already being
defrosted at that point, and you can't defrost all of them at once.

      Yeah, it was a coincidence.  Synchronicity.  It happens.  It
doesn't happen much on this show, hardly ever.  I figured she'd be one
of the last in, and thus the first out.  Synchronicity and coincidences
*do* happen.  How many times have you reached for the phone to call
someone to find the phone ringing, and it's them on the other end? 
What're the odds of Oedipus killing his father and marrying his mother
out of all the possible kingdoms in the area?  It happens.  As long as
it doesn't happen to excess, it's not something I'm worried about.

                                                                  jms
