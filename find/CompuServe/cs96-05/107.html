<H2>WwE Part 1 Question</H2>
<h3>Date: 11-May-96 22:28:14</h3>
<pre> Automedia, Inc. &lt;70530.2521@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is it supposed to be a Shadow beam or some other race's?

      Sigh...no, it's a piece of stock footage from "Sky."  We don't
make the promos.  On the other hand, they've been doing a much better
job lately, so I'm not about to complain.

                                                                  jms
