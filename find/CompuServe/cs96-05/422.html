<H2>&lt;&lt;Time Travel Ques.&gt;&gt;</H2>
<h3>Date: 27-May-96 21:10:29</h3>
<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; talking about time travel, was the scenes with garibaldi with
&gt; more hair, scenes that where taped back during the first season,
&gt; or where they taped now? is that true and how many episodes are
&gt; left of season three?

      Yes, the Garibaldi scenes in part 2 were all from the first
season; and the last 5 eps will apparently be held for October to ramp
up the ratings for the November sweeps.

                                                                  jms
