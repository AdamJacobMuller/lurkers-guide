<pre> Robin L. Small &lt;76640.2012@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Has the poising Kosh thread from the pilot ever been completely
&gt; addressed? any answers??

      What's really left to address?  The reasons given were the
reasons; the Minbari warrior caste were very much against the Babylon
project; an extremist clan within that caste decided to frame Sinclair
for murder, using what little info they had on the vorlons, in an
attempt to destabalize or defeat the goals of B5.

                                                                  jms
