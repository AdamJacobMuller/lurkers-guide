<pre> Richard M. Perry &lt;76461.2737@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is there a parallel (intended or not) in the "effects" of Kosh's
&gt; death and his calling John, son; and the winged legend known as a
&gt; Phoenix? If so, will Kosh be re-born in one form or another?
&gt; Or has he already?
&gt; Also, what was different about Kosh's confrontation with Morden's
&gt; associates this time as opposed to the one in "Signs and
&gt; Portents"? Was it just that there were more of them this time, or
&gt; was there some kind of agreement reached in the earlier one?

      The earlier confrontation was a jurisdictional one; this one was
about retribution.

                                                                  jms
