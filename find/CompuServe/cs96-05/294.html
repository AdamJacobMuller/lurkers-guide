<H2>Joe an atheist?</H2>
<h3>Date: 21-May-96 23:18:50</h3>
<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; This is a bit off-subject, but I was wondering: as an athiest,
&gt; where do you believe that life came from originally? The cell
&gt; theory states that all cells must come from pre-existing cells,
&gt; but where did the first one come from?

      You tell me where god came from originally, and I'll tell you
where that first bit of matter came from originally.

                                                                  jms
