      Actually, Sebastian said that bit about dying alone to both
Sheridan and Delenn.  Who knows, he may have known something....

      Yes, if Kosh had run, which wasn't in his character in the first
place, someone else would've paid that price.

      Londo still has chances, if he doesn't blow them.  You'll see a
bit more about this in the two-parter.

      Yes, some Vorlons do appear to us as female versions.

                                                                  jms
