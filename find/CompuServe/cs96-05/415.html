      No, the information is *not* true, and I sent Steve a note about
this. The meeting to renew/not renew B5 hasn't happened yet, though
it'll be happening shortly.  Some individual stations have signed on,
but that isn't the same thing as renewal, since WB will make its
decision based on the final number of stations that do sign on, vs.
those that don't, or those that put it in an unworkable timeslot.

                                                                  jms
