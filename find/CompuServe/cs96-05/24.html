<pre> Rebecca Eschliman &lt;76072.2345@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Are there any myth-legend cycles that you are (or later became)
&gt; acquainted with that you wished you had room for in B5, but
&gt; couldn't fit in, for one reason or another?

      Dunno...I don't really make a list of what I'd like to do; it's
all just one big melting pot in the back of my head, and it all sifts
together.

                                                                 jms
