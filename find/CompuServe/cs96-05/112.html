"One of the bedrock elements of science is that for a theory to be
taken seriously it must be falsifiable."

Nope.  If that's what you're thinking, then I suggest you go back and
check, because that's not correct in any respect.  To take the green
penguins at the north pole scenario again, I can search for 165 years,
and not find any, and you can say, "Well, I guess you just missed them,
but they're there."

It is not the purpose of scientific endeavor to *disprove* every
assertion, only to prove them.

Your statement is simply false.  I'm sorry.  Saying it's so doesn't
make it so.  So everything that proceeds from that is equally flawed. 
Any scientist or logician here will back me up on this.  You may not
want to hear it, Daniel, but you're simply wrong on this.

                                                                  jms
