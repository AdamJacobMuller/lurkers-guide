<H2>&lt;Time Stabilizer Thingy&gt;</H2>
<h3>Date: 24-May-96 02:08:46</h3>
<pre> Ben Roberto &lt;71203.1514@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; 1) In "Babylon Squared" after Zathras hands The One 'a' time
&gt; stabilizer, which one was it? His or the repaired one?
&gt; Did he lie to them?
&gt; What did I miss?
&gt; Or was it the whole device?

      Sheridan's stabalizer basically broke into two major pieces, the
front section which fell off in the White Star, and the back half which
was still clipped to his belt, and later came off as Zathras watched.

                                                                  jms
