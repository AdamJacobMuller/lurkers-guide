<pre> Ray Pelzer &lt;70475.1263@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; And as for the little "keepers", are they a going-away present
&gt; from the Shadows, or are they ANOTHER item with which we must
&gt; concern ourselves?

      You needn't concern yourself with the keeper...for a while yet.

                                                                  jms
