<pre> Theresa Kinney &lt;70751.3262@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Who else could it have been?
&gt; perhaps we'll see more of the Narn Resistance in the future,
&gt; redesigned under the "Round Table" framework?

      Actually, what I'd said was that these 2-3 eps between big arcs
were NOT arc stories per se, but breathers.  Just to clarify....

                                                                  jms
