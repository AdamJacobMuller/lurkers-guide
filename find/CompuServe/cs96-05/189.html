       Oddly enough...I think there's room for arc series elsewhere. 
What I think is killing Murder One is that we just lived *through* this
with the OJ Simpson trial, and everybody kind of got uniformly fed up
with it, and so just don't have it in them to go through it again in a
fictional environment.

                                                                  jms
