<H2>&lt;Sheridan:A Man Unstuck&gt;</H2>
<h3>Date: 30-May-96 03:48:17</h3>
<pre> &lt;David L. Gold&gt; &lt;73177.1161@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Why did he appear on the Centari homeworld?
&gt; Why not on Earth, or Minbar, or well - deep space?
&gt; The Abyss of *what*?
&gt; The Abyss of going back in the time vortex?
&gt; The Abyss of deep space?
&gt; The Abyss of the Shadow's base on Z'ha'dum?
&gt; What?
&gt; And if he jumped to the place where his future-self was, then
&gt; what happened to his future-self once the present-day Sheridan
&gt; popped in?

      Simple logic.  Sheridan slid forward in time, to wherever he was
at that moment in the future.  He didn't just go hopping around
aimlessly; if he flipped 10 days ahead, he'd come into his body at that
point 10 days from now, wherever he happened to be.  At that moment, 17
years down the road, he happened to be on Centauri Prime.

                                                                  jms
