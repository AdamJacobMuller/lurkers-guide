<H2>JMS: Quick Question</H2>
<h3>Date: 06-May-96 21:44:33</h3>
<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Are the former EA personnel now part of the Rangers -- or are
&gt; they still separate from the Rangers themselves? Or is it just
&gt; kinda mish-mashed together with Sheridan technically being in
&gt; command of both entities, with Delenn as official co-ommander on
&gt; the Ranger side of things and Ivanova his second-in-command on
&gt; the former EA side of things? What do they call themselves now
&gt; anyway -- Rebels?

      The patch signifies their alliance with the Rangers, yes.

                                                                  jms
