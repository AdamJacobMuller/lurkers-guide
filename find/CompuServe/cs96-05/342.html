      Thanks.  Actually, I seem to recall, after that Londo/G'Kar
scene was shown the last time, posting somewhere that folks now knew
*what* has happened, but they don't yet know the *context*.  Very few
picked up on that and thought to actually reverse what they *thought*
they were seeing to what they *might* be seeing.

                                                                  jms
