<H2>&lt;Rage's Thots: I&amp;E&gt;</H2>
<h3>Date: 13-May-96 16:15:09</h3>
<pre> Chad Underkoffler &lt;102512.1310@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; "Where?"
&gt; How do you *write* like that?!?
&gt; Ed just exudes menace like slime, doesn't he?
&gt; (I mean that in the best possible way.) An interesting thought:
&gt; What are the standing Security orders re: Morden?

      Yes, there is something thematically present about growing up,
and parents, and coming of age that threads through the story.

      And yes, there's the deliberate irony...that just as we finally
start to really hear from Kosh...he's gone.  Snatched away just as we
got close. Which would add to the feelings.

      Good analysis.

                                                                  jms
