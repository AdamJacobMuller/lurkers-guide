<h3>Date: 20-May-96 17:59:35</h3>
<pre> Bert Johnson &lt;102476.201@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Two, who did Delenn see in Sheridan's quarters?
&gt; In the future of that timeline, did they have a daughter?
&gt; I think they identify with him ("No one listen to Zathras") Will
&gt; we see him again?

      The eye was of the keeper on Londo's shoulder, you can see
G'Kar's fingers gripping a part of it.  It woke up.

      The other questions will have to wait, and be answered in the
series.

                                                                  jms
