<h3>Date: 15-May-96 12:56:15</h3>
<pre> Bernard F. Dowdy, J &lt;76550.347@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; In "Ship of Tears" how did Bester's fighter get into B5 space?
&gt; And if he hitched a ride on a larger vessel with jump drive, why
&gt; didn't B5 detect the jump point? Is their early warning system
&gt; damaged or deficient in some way perhaps?

       It hitched a ride; and it's far enough outside B5...about an
hour or so in normal space...that they wouldn't have picked it up.

                                                                  jms
