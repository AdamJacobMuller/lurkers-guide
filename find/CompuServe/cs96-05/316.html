<H2>&lt;&lt;Time Travel Ques.&gt;&gt;</H2>
<h3>Date: 22-May-96 21:18:43</h3>
<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Is the time travel that Sheridan experienced to the Centari
&gt; homeworld different from the time flashes experienced by
&gt; Garibladi, Delenn, Krantz, and others on Babylon 4? If these
&gt; flashes are different, then is the Sheridan of 2278(?) dead,
&gt; lost, or just somewhere else? Does Delenn continue on the mission
&gt; alone?

      No, Sheridan "leapt" into his future self, hence the difference
in wardrobe and appearance.  Londo wasn't suprised to see him.  If you
recall the Centauri guard when we first arrive in the Palace, he says,
"I think he's awake again, would you like to see?"  The implication
being that he's been beaten into unconsciousness, hence Londo's line,
"Welcome back from the abyss."  It was at that moment of
unconsciousness that he "slid" into his future self.

                                                                  jms
