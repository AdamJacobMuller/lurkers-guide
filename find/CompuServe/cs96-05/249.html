<pre> Mike Hoffmann &lt;100321.2604@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; You are saying that *in one alternate universe* Sheridan will be
&gt; on Centauri Prime, just like in 8 days in one alternate universe
&gt; Ivanova will cry to the universe for help while the Shadows blast
&gt; B5 to hell and in one alternate universe Garibaldi sacrifices
&gt; himself for Sinclair?

      There are no alternate univeses, only alternate or possible
futures. If they didn't go back, the future in which Sinclair is there
with Garibaldi -- having come back to see through the final battle --
and in which Sheridan is killed, and Ivanova is calling for help...that
future will come true.

                                                                  jms
