<H2>JMS: Arc a Fake?</H2>
<h3>Date: 11-May-96 22:28:03</h3>
<pre> Rebecca Eschliman &lt;76072.2345@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Don't we have here a really good example of the Heisenberg
&gt; Uncertainty Principle shifted from the laboratory to the
&gt; storytelling platform? Are you ever astonished at the
&gt; interpretations applied like a varnish over the story as you see
&gt; it?

      Yes, I'm often intrigued -- don't know if I'd say astonished --
at how the story is sometimes interpreted.  But that's the interactive
part of the process, what the viewer takes away is sometimes only
indirectly the result of what's actually *there*.  Take modern art for
a moment.  You show me a white canvas broken only by a single red dot
in the lower left hand corner, I see a single red dot in the lower left
hand corner of a white canvas, nod and walk away...somebody else takes
a look at it, and sees a telling commentary on isolationism and the
Communist scare of the 50s and man's basic inhumanity to man.

      Anything that passes for art reflects the work's creator, and
the viewer; it's a mirror that works in two directions, and neither
reflection holds the totality of the work individually.  Art happens in
the moments in-between.
