<pre> Daniel M. Upton &lt;75442.1331@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; could it be that the Shadows technical advantage lies in the
&gt; field of propulsion? First, why didn't Kosh flee the station and
&gt; go into Vorlon space before ordering the attack on the Shadows? 
&gt; Were Shadow vessels haunting hyperspace in the region of the
&gt; station ready to destroy him if he tried to leave? Why didn't he
&gt; ask Sheridan and Delenn for Ranger bodyguards? Would the Shadows
&gt; have simply killed them and then pressed their attack on Kosh or
&gt; would bringing things that far out in the open have left the
&gt; Shadows with no more reason not to directly attack the station? 
&gt; Why was Kosh able to order the Vorlon fleet to attack the
&gt; Shadows? Was his position in the Vorlon hierarchy higher than the
&gt; title of ambassador would indicate? was he, like Delenn was
&gt; originally, part of some kind of governing body? Why did Morden
&gt; and the Shadows automatically know that when the Vorlon fleet
&gt; attacked them that Kosh was behind it? And most importantly, why
&gt; are the Vorlon still "too few" to directly engage the Shadows? So
&gt; again, why aren't they ready? Why are the Shadows, who had to play
&gt; catchup in a big way, able to field a navy that has the
&gt; "thousands" of ships that Londo saw in his vision while the
&gt; Vorlons are still "too few"?

      Because I think, on some level, Kosh knew it was inevitable; a
price had to be paid.  In a way, Lincoln had the same feelings...why
was he to live when so many had died?  In a way, he knew he wouldn't
live much longer. Also, it would mean running...and the Vorlons don't
run.  If he fled, another would pay the price...and that also wouldn't
be right.

                                                                  jms
