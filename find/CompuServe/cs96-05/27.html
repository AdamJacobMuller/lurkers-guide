<pre> Toni Muller &lt;75223.1575@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I felt frustration and confusion at his situation (how did it get
&gt; this bad? why didn't he get help sooner?
&gt; Question: Can Londo hear the Shadows now because he has turned
&gt; toward the darkness, or was he allowed to hear so he'd be
&gt; intimidated? Our phone rang right after that scene, and I debated
&gt; on whether or not to answer it because I was afraid the person
&gt; would ask me, "What's wrong?" That battle between the Vorlons and
&gt; the Shadows was a joy to watch (can battle be "a joy?"

      Thanks.  The Kosh stuff, his scene with Sheridan, and his
passing, is very moving.  I showed it at Marcon this weekend in Ohio,
and many folks, including Patricia Talman -- who hadn't seen it yet --
were in tears at that. That, to me, is the moment when you know you've
done something, when you can make people *feel* something.  Not just a
plot exercise, but you hit down deep where it hurts, or can make
someone laugh.  It's all about touching emotion...or what's the point?

                                                                  jms
