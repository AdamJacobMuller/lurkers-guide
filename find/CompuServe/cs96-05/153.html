<h3>Date: 13-May-96 20:58:57</h3>
<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Now that Kosh is dead (still hard to accept), what happens to
&gt; Lyta Alexander? She was Kosh's special attache, wasn't she?
&gt; Or is she working with ALL of the Vorlon?

      She'll now have to work with the incoming replacement Vorlon,
who might be just a bit miffed....

                                                                  jms
