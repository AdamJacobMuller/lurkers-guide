<pre> Philip Hornsey &lt;74053.2101@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Any suggestions?

      A toast for a wedding, eh?  I'm not usually asked to do this
sort of thing -- I generally avoid those morbid parentheticals of the
human soul, weddings and funerals -- but off the top of my head....

      The heart is an inland sea, surrounded on either side by
infinities of time.  On one side, the unsteady molecule, shaken by
storm and the unlikely perambulations of amino acids, paraded across
the centuries until their name was man, and woman, until they created
poetries and cities and walked across the Sea of Tranquility.  On the
other side, an uncertain future, waiting to be shaped by hands clasped
across that ocean of possibilities.  Looked at from here, in the
starlight of sanctified vows, that horizon can be daunting, even 
frightening.  But there is nothing so dark or so profound that it can
outwit the infinity that is behind you, or undo all that went into
creating you.  Any problems before you are temporary; but the inland
sea of the heart is eternal. May your journey be filled with calm seas
and clear skies, guided by the compass of your entwined souls.

                                                                  jms
