<pre> Richard M. Perry &lt;76461.2737@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I will always go" and Kosh's "I will always be here"?
&gt; Also, I was wondering which way did Delenn slide (past or future)
&gt; and what did she experience? What warning was attempted to be
&gt; given to her? (maybe that was why he gave in to Sheridan, because
&gt; he knew it must come) Oh, I almost forgot; does Valen go on to
&gt; have a wife and childern in those 100 yrs? And if so where does
&gt; his line continue into? (maybe Delenn?

      No, the two statements don't have any relationship; and Delenn's
flash was a look forward.

                                                                  jms
