<H2>Some thots on &lt;&lt;WWE2&gt;&gt;</H2>
<h3>Date: 23-May-96 14:02:58</h3>
<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; 1) How long has Lennier known Sinclair was Valen?
&gt; Why else would the Minbari reject everyone for commander of B5
&gt; until they got to Sinclair? Did Ivanova make the connection, too?
&gt; What about the other Minbari on the bridge -- was this a
&gt; revelation for them as well? Now that they know who Valen really
&gt; was, how will they react to Minbari who revere him as a religious
&gt; figure? Will they tell Garibaldi?
&gt; Will he freak out?
&gt; 4) Didn't ya just love the stuff between Sinclair and
&gt; Delenn????!!!!??? is she Sheridan's and Delenn's daughter?
&gt; Why, oh why did I mail all my first season tapes to Oklahoma two
&gt; weeks ago? 7) So now can we say, "In Sinclair's Name?"
&gt; instead of "In Valen's Name," as an oath?
&gt; 8) So, do ya think one of those Vorlons was Kosh?
&gt; And, ohmygosh, is Kosh *actually* Valeria?
&gt; Did they appear to him, or did he call them somehow?) And does
&gt; Sincalir know that Kosh was killed? SO where do we go from here?

       To your question, yes, the scenes with Zathras pinned under the
strut were the same scenes from B2, we didn't reshoot that material.

       The hardest shot was matching the lighting and composition in
the central corridor *exactly* for the Ivanova-on-the-link scene, and
the walk by seconds later by Garibaldi and Sinclair.  That came out
pretty seamless.

                                                                  jms
