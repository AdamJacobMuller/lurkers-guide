<H2>JMS: 'Drop Dead' Date?</H2>
<h3>Date: 06-May-96 21:44:38</h3>
<pre> Kevin P. Kenney &lt;104102.352@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; When is that date this year?
&gt; Any word if you'll be presenting at the San Diego Comic Con this
&gt; year? Any suggestions?

      I believe the true, honest, drop-dead date is June 10th, which
is when we have to pick up the actors' contracts.  If it's after that,
we lose our options on the actors.

      Re: Red Clay Ramblers...I'd suggest their album "It Ain't
Right," from Flying Fish Records in Chicago.  It's got some of their
best stuff in it, from the title song to "Ezekiel in the Valley of the
Dry Bones" (which was on as I wrote "Ceremonies"), and a wonderfully
sick, twisted and funny song called "The Merchant's Lunch."

                                                                  jms
