<h3>Date: 27-May-96 20:25:56</h3>
<pre> Jonathan Kass &lt;74130.443@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; What caused Delenn's time flash?
&gt; Also, are we to assume Sheridan didn't have any other
&gt; "interesting" flashes before Delenn gave him the stabilizer?

      Throughout the episode, whenever there's a tachyon burst, pretty
much everyone has a timeflash of one sort or another (as also mentioned
in Babylon Squared).

                                                                  jms
