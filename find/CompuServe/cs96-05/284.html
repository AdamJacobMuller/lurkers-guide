<pre> Toby Johnson &lt;104305.1442@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Was his ship made/created for him??
&gt; and if so was it as old as he was??

      It was made for Kosh, as Delenn points out, was almost a part of
him; it wouldn't function as well, if at all, for anyone else.  There
was nothing else to be done.

                                                                  jms
