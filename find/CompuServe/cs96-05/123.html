<pre> BRIAN COONEY &lt;100551.1656@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; After the opening, the actors names and eps title are in a
&gt; different text any reason way?

      I suspect that this is because we provide textless sections in
the beginning to foreign markets for various languages, so they set
them in a different type.  I guess....

                                                                  jms
