<pre> annie &lt;104246.3046@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Franklin be back before next year?

       Franklin isn't gone from the show; he's in the very next
episode, in a major way, and has a big part in "Shadow Dancing."  He
just has a lot to work out right now.

                                                                  jms
