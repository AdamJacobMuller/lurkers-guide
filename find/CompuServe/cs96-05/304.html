<pre> Jerome Keating &lt;76243.620@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I have a question - remember when Ivanona when to go meet with
&gt; those "old ones" and they they said to come get them when it is
&gt; time - well isn't now a good time???? with the shadow in the open
&gt; attacking many races - now would seem opportune - do you plan on
&gt; bringing them in the fourth season?? second question - were those
&gt; old ones the only ones contacted by "our heros" ??

      Tentatively, they'll show up in the fourth season...and they
will have to get some more First Ones on board.

                                                                  jms
