<pre> Simon Grierson &lt;100407.2075@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Geez, would she REALLY have blasted Bester??
&gt; After that final conversation between Bester and his ascociate, -
&gt; is it possible that the Psi-corp PUT that Dust dealer onboard B5
&gt; as an excuse to come on and do some snooping? Am I man enough to
&gt; say I could have cryed?

      Yes, she would've blasted...she gave the order to fire; only the
fact that Sheridan gave the over-ride at the same moment stopped it.

                                                                  jms
