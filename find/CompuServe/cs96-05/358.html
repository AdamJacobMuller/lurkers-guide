<h3>Date: 24-May-96 22:04:31</h3>
<pre> &lt;David L. Gold&gt; &lt;73177.1161@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Did it *really* come during Ranger training, or was the scar
&gt; *supposed* to have been inflicted by Kosh ( as we saw happen to
&gt; Sheridan )? Had Michael remained on the series to the present day,
&gt; would _that_ have been the original reason for the scar on
&gt; Sinclair?

      No, because you'll note that Sheridan isn't scarred by it.  No,
you have to remember that one doesn't just transplant one storyline
onto another.  It doesn't work that way.  Sinclair has his arc,
Sheridan has his own.

                                                                  jms
