      I think probably most races that have to evolve through a
superstitious phase, at some point enter a religious phase (which is an
organized system of superstition by strictest definition) until such
time as the tools are there for the more scientific description of the
universe.  So within that context, yes, most cultures would have at
least one major figure in that area in its history.

                                                                  jms
