<pre> Mike Hoffmann &lt;100321.2604@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; My question is, whether such usage would fall under fair use or
&gt; be prohibited by trademarks or if it is possible to gain
&gt; permission from you or WB to use such a name, by giving a
&gt; guaranty that any sites under that name would not deliver data
&gt; that falls under these new indecency laws? There already happens
&gt; to be a vorlon.com, did they just use the name or did they gain
&gt; permission from WB first?

      If you make it a .com name, you will eventually run afoul of WB.

                                                                  jms
