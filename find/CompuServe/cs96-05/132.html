<H2>JMS: Arc a Fake?</H2>
<h3>Date: 13-May-96 00:22:05</h3>
<pre> Rebecca Eschliman &lt;76072.2345@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is this difference something that will be addressed at a later
&gt; date or a nice detail that will simply be a source of viewer
&gt; speculation? Will her reaction to his death come into play in a
&gt; later epidose?

      The red ship was simply another variation on the standard;
nothing too major about it...and yes, when Lyta returns from her
errand, she'll definitely get into this, and there will have to be some
explanations made, though not to her....

      And thanks.

                                                                  jms
