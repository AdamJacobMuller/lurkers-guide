<h3>Date: 11-May-96 15:55:33</h3>
<pre> John Hardin &lt;74076.22@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Could you please post this note to either JMS, or to the
&gt; moderated info notesfile? Was that man Morden, or Sinclair?

      It was Morden.  If it were Sinclair, the actor would've been
noted in the credits.

                                                                  jms
