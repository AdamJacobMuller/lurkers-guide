<h3>Date: 16-May-96 22:33:49</h3>
<pre> Daniel M. Upton &lt;75442.1331@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Did the Minbari agree to help fund B5 after getting a look at the
&gt; nearly finished B4 and realizing what it was?

      No, because if you remember, even Delenn didn't know where B4
came from until she came to B5, well after completion.

                                                                  jms
