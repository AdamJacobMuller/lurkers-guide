      "Different (alien) doesn't mean illogical in my book."

      I can think of a number of Zen schools of thought that you would
consider vastly illogical...but quite human.  There are many things we
would consider illogical to a western mind that are perfectly
reasonable elsewhere.

                                                                  jms
