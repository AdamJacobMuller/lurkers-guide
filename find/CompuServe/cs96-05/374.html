<h3>Date: 26-May-96 14:36:39</h3>
<pre> Automedia, Inc. &lt;70530.2521@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; When Delenn is in the center chair on the White Star as Sheridan
&gt; is lost for the second time, what causes her to go down into the
&gt; station at *exactly* the right moment to see and "rescue"
&gt; Sheridan? Was it in her letter?

      Mainly just a feeling she had, best to check everything out for
herself, make sure things were going properly, since they were getting
right down to the wire.  Also, in case Ivanova got into trouble trying
to get into C&amp;C, she wanted to be closer to the situation to help, if
necessary.

                                                                  jms
