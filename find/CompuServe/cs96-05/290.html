<H2>WWE Question</H2>
<h3>Date: 21-May-96 00:24:52</h3>
<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Why hasn't the design changed?
&gt; Ritual?
&gt; Also, where did Sinclair get the scar?
&gt; Could you please 'Splain this to me, Lucy?

      The design *has* changed; the main section is much longer, and
more primitive looking, less tricked out.  You can see a bit of it
there, but you will see them in more detail in part two.

      Sinclair was scarred during ranger training duties.

                                                                  jms
