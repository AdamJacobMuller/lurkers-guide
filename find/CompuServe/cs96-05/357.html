      Oddly enough, there was a squib on the news the other day that
indicated scientists were able, albeit briefly, to have the same
subatomic particle exist in two separate places at the same time, much
to everyone's consternation.  (They don't think something like a person
could do it, in that we are too "quantum mechanically complex.")
