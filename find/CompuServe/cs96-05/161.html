<pre> John M. Kahane &lt;102664.773@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; The only question I have about this is will we, the audience, be
&gt; able to tell that there is a different Vorlon on the station,
&gt; other than through the personality of said character?

       You'll know the difference.  Believe me.

                                                                  jms
