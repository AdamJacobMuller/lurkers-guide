<pre> Daniel M. Upton &lt;75442.1331@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; You want to censor the internet, or ban guns?

     Daniel, you Keep Missing the Point.

      If "free speech (and) the right to keep and bear arms are God
given rights," then why didn't God give them?  Why did it take a number
of humans to *decide* that it was time to strive for something better? 
The rights you speak of were never given by god, they were given by
those who spent their life's blood in an effort to create something
better for their inheritors. If god had anything to say on this issue,
he should've said it in the 6,000 years preceding, and *done* something
about it.  He didn't.  We did.

                                                                  jms
