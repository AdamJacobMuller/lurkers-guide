<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Since when does Zack know about the White Star, and is it now
&gt; general knowledge among the B5 staff?

      Yeah, the White Star has been common knowledge ever since it
came in at the end of "Severed Dreams."  Certainly, by virtue of being
Garibaldi's second in command, he'd know about it.  At this point, most
everything is out in the open now.

                                                                  jms
