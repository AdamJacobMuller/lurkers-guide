<pre> John M. Kahane &lt;102664.773@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Now that Kosh is dead (and I presume that you won't be bringing
&gt; this character back to life), what was it about the character of
&gt; Kosh that you really liked and really disliked?

      Actually, there wasn't much about Kosh I disliked...except his
cryptic ways...they're all annoying that way.

                                                                   jms
