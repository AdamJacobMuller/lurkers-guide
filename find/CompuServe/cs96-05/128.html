<pre> Elyse M. Grasso &lt;70302.3304@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Are they a lot bigger now?
&gt; How big do they grow?

      No, they're about the same height consistently; it's probably an
artifact of the camera angles and lighting.

                                                                  jms
