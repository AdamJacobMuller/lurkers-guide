<pre> Bert Johnson &lt;102476.201@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I think it is incredibly symbolic that Kosh visited both Sheridan
&gt; in Interludes and G'Kar in the previous episode as their fathers
&gt; The one thing that bothers me is that now the Shadows and the war
&gt; are out in the open as of at least two episodes, why why why do
&gt; they let Morden walk around the station at will?

       They would do so, but since the fall from Earth, as Susan
mentioned, they've had to hire guards who may not be above bribes, as
we saw in the teaser.  And Morden is good at covering his footsteps.

                                                                  jms
