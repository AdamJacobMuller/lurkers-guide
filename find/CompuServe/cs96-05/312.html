<pre> Automedia, Inc. &lt;70530.2521@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is that also the case with WwE (1 and/or 2)?
&gt; If so, would you be able to comment on the scenes cut or is that
&gt; right out?

      Thanks.  There were a few small bits cut out of WWE2, but at
this late remove, I honestly can't remember what they were now.  It's
all a blur....

                                                                   jms
