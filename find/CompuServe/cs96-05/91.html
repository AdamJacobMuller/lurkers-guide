<H2>&lt;&lt;Interludes Question&gt;&gt;</H2>
<h3>Date: 11-May-96 01:35:28</h3>
<pre> Larry Rosenblum &lt;72122.1555@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Why did Londo not mention Adira since his original fling with
&gt; her, before this episode?
&gt; F

      Basically because it's hard in an episode to just bring up
something out of the blue unless you're going to use it.  You're stuck
with, "Boy, I wish Adira were here...so what's for dinner?"  Which will
mean nothing to the folks who didn't see the first season unless you
then talk more about her, show her...and then suddenly you REALLY have
to deal with it or it's intrusive.

                                                                  jms
