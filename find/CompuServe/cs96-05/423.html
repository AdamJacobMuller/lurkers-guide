<pre> Brian P. Delaney &lt;103640.3511@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; master plan?
&gt; or just a pleasant episodic dalliance?

      Good heavens, no, I wasn't offended...I guess what was coming
out was the "tone" I really tend to hold in my own internal dialogues
when I go over the good parts and the flaws.  You must understand that
I'm *far* more critical of this show than anyone else could EVER be. 
So no, good grief, there was no offense taken at all.

                                                                  jms
