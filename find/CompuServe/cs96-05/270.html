<h3>Date: 19-May-96 20:38:50</h3>
<pre> Chad Underkoffler &lt;102512.1310@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Are we to assume that if all goes well, the variant future of
&gt; Sinclair and Garibaldi's flashforwards will be wiped out of
&gt; existence? Are these flashforwards becoming 'unstuck in time'?
&gt; If so, why didn't Sinclair and Garibaldi vanish like Johnny did?
&gt; Is Johnny's unstuck jump *able* to be wiped out of existence like
&gt; the visions mentioned above? In B^2, do we ever see Sinclair or
&gt; Garibaldi in oldstyle EA uniforms, or just the black riot gear? 
&gt; (Lucy and Ethel? Was Kosh *taller* than this guy?
&gt; *Why does Lennier seem to always mention new functionalities of
&gt; the ship in the middle of combat? *Why hasn't Johnny gotten fully
&gt; checked out on the ship as he did with the Thunderbolts in SoT? 
&gt; *BTW, what phrases were thrown up on the screen behind Delenn in
&gt; Minbari script? Was it like Vir's Aloha shirt, or actual
&gt; Minbarese? * Just *when* is Johnny supposed to go to Z'ha'dum?
&gt; And just what does "If you go to Z'ha'dum, you will die" MEAN?
&gt; What does that MEAN?
&gt; why does there have to be seven days between episodes?
&gt; F

      Thanks.  To the questions...no, we only saw the black flak
uniforms in B2, because I knew we'd be changing them, but wanted to
hide that fact (as I did with Delenn's line to Sinclair in B2, done
off-camera to hide her change). And the Minbar cityscape was done by
Eric Chauvin.
