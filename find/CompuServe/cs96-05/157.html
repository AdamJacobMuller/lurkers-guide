<H2>Joe an atheist?</H2>
<h3>Date: 14-May-96 13:39:20</h3>
<pre> Dimitri M LaBarge &lt;71501.3353@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Who was right, what was the proper interpretation of this church?
&gt; Yet, aren't Pelagius' ideas of an human-powered Christianity
&gt; equally as valid as the self-hating Augustinian conception?

       Good points.  (And of course, there's Martin Luther and his
fistful of theses nailed to a door....)

                                                                  jms
