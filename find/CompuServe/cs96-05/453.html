<pre> Alan Hedge &lt;72017.3232@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; One question though, Zathras say Zathras oldest living keeper of
&gt; Great Machine (or something like that), but why Zathras not still
&gt; keeper? Was Zathras keeper before (forget name, Drall's
&gt; predecessor)? Did Zathras do something wrong so that Zathras not
&gt; kepper anymore? Or did Al misunderstand what Zathras meant?

      No, just that Zathras has worked on the machine, and survived
it, the longest of all the others.

                                                                  jms
