      Thanks, and thanks again a second time for giving me a GREAT
reason for, er, *deliberately* making those little mistakes...yes,
that's right, I had to think about not causing the end of the universe,
after all...writer have great responsibility, yes, thinking great
thoughts, Zathras knows what he is doing...are you going to finish
those fries?

                                                                  jms
