<H2>Joe an atheist?</H2>
<h3>Date: 14-May-96 23:13:13</h3>
<pre> Jon A. Bell &lt;74124.276@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is it just me, or is there something wrong with this picture?
&gt; (Then again, I live in San Francisco, and becoming an Ordained
&gt; Minister of Anything in California is probably just a matter of
&gt; filling out a form and paying $20 to someone.) The Church of
&gt; Silly Walks, anyone?

"My stepfather, a tax accountant, informed me that the pay of ordained
ministers does not have Social Security taxes taken out of it, on the
grounds that in their dotage, their flock will take care of them. Is it
just me, or is there something wrong with this picture?"

Yes, it proves that the social security system is completely flocked.
