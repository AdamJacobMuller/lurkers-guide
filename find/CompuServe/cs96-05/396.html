<pre> &lt;David L. Gold&gt; &lt;73177.1161@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Kinda curious here, but since the show is closed captioned -
&gt; would those lines have been included in the closed captioning? And
&gt; if it was, did *they* get the spelling right?

      No, doubt they were captioned.

                                                                jms
