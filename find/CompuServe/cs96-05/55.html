<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; While we're on the subject, when was this little change of heart
&gt; for Bester planned? Was it at the start, when you did Mind War, or
&gt; something just this season?

      Yes, this was definitely intended from the start with Bester.

                                                                 jms
