<pre> Elyse M. Grasso &lt;70302.3304@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; When it was over and I was breathing again, I wondered, was this
&gt; the death where the actor asked "why me?"

      This was the "now me" episode.  The "why me?" episode is yet to
come.

                                                                  jms
