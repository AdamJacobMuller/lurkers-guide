<pre> Doug Quinn &lt;76330.350@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Now, the question is, how long has Deleen known that Sinclair
&gt; was/is/will be Valen? Did they discover this when he was captured?
&gt; (I'd think not, else the Grey Council would not have told deleen
&gt; to kill Sinclair should he remember being captured.) Did Deleen
&gt; find out when Kosh came on board? (Kosh clearly knew what the deal
&gt; was, which explains why he didn't hang around the Council much
&gt; when Sinclair was in charge of the Station -- didn't want to
&gt; accidentily mess the time line up.) Did Deleen find out when she
&gt; came into posession of the "cocoon" machine? And here, since I
&gt; haven't seen the second part of this yet, I'm assuming that the
&gt; thing Sinclair is clearly putting a triluminary on in the preview
&gt; is the machine that goes into the past with him and later -- 1000
&gt; years later -- comes into Deleen's posession, since this explains
&gt; the "Valen was more than Minbari" line.) Or was she as much in
&gt; the dark as Sinclair himself was, right up to the moment when he
&gt; got a letter from his future/past self telling him what was going
&gt; to happen? What was in the note she received just prior to
&gt; Sinclair arriving on B5? What must Deleen think of this?
&gt; A _human_ becoming half-Minbari as the founder of her
&gt; civilization's government? Valen is also apparently looked up to
&gt; as a _religious_ figure -- how might other Minbari react to the
&gt; knowledge that Valen was half human? Or that Sinclair's Minbari
&gt; name sounds almost identical to the stone in the Ranger's pin, a
&gt; stone which represents the coming together of the human and
&gt; Minbari halves into one whole (a la Deleen's fusion, a la
&gt; Sinclair's coming fusion into Valen)?

      On the Grey Council and Sinclair, I just left a note on this, so
you may want to check that one rather than my repeating it here.  But
yes, you seem to be close to it all...which is good.  All the pieces
have been there, certainly.

                                                                  jms
