       Thanks.  Lennier will be getting some more screen time shortly,
in the next batch of episodes.  (There's some very nice stuff with him
and both Delenn and Marcus in "Grey 17 Is Missing.")

       "intellectual crack"...an interesting notion....

       Thanks again.

                                                                  jms
