<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; My first thought was "What is that, a Vorlon temple or embassy or
&gt; something?" Is that because he's been around Vorlon's too long or
&gt; Ranger One too long?

      After a while, you get used to that from Vorlons.

                                                                  jms
