<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; You've mentioned recently about trying to get things moving for
&gt; the UK viewrs/fans/rabid mottley crew (that's US!) over here, but
&gt; I've not seen anything of late: What's the score, please?

       Still working at it.

                                                                  jms
