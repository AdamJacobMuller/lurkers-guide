       There's no relation between the aliens working for the shadows
and the Streib.  The ones you saw in the flash were "doctors" of a sort
doing the work; there was no abduction required except of course the
covert kidnapping from the Psi Corps Re-education Center.  As for
Bester's look behind, he was just looking to the guards behind him, and
the ones in front of him.

                                                                  jms
