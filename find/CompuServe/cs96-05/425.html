<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; When we see Vir pick up the symbol of the Emperor after Londo and
&gt; G'Kar are dead, does he already have a keeper as Londo did?

       No, Vir doesn't have a keeper.  They would, of course, try to
take care of that detail afterward.

                                                                  jms
