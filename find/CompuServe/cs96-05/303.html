      Thanks.  It was a good sendoff.  (At one point, Bruce said to me
over lunch, with Michael sitting with us, "Hey, so how come HE gets to
go off and become the next best thing to God and I get the crap kicked
out of me?"  I shrugged.  "Seniority.")

                                                                  jms
