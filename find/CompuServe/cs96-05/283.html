<H2>I&amp;E Thought</H2>
<h3>Date: 20-May-96 17:59:28</h3>
<pre> Automedia, Inc. &lt;70530.2521@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Was this little parallel intentional?
&gt; And if so, is that worth noting for later or was it just one of
&gt; the many tools you employ?

      Not an intentional parallel, no, but often to achieve something,
one must decide if it's more important than one's life.  That's kind of
descriptive of the whole of human history, frankly....

                                                                  jms
