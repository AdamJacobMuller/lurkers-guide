       The leather strip was also present when we shot the original,
Babylon Squared, in year one.  I was kinda thinking at the time that
the change was gradually being introduced in various divisions of
Earthforce.  Krantz is from the Marines division, I believe (note the
brown uniform), from that part which functions sort of like the Army
Corps of Engineers, overseeing the building of space stations and the
like.  Since it takes time to introduce a uniform change across
divisions and light years, I figured some might have them earlier than
others, or to try them out.  So I gave Krantz the leather strip.

                                                                  jms
