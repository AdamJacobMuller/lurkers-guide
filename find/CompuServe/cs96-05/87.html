<pre> Cathy Holley &lt;75204.1515@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Now, anybody know where I can get videos of the first two
&gt; seasons? How about the pilot?

      Welcome to the party.  Videos aren't currently available, though
the second and third season episodes can get rerun over the coming
year.

      And you can always disagree with a decision...and explain why. 
Around the stage, we have a simple policy...anybody can go up to me and
say, "Joe, it sucks."  And tell me why.  And if they're right, they get
to stay....

                                                                  jms
