&gt; While I'm sure that you never intended the comparison when you
&gt; wrote SoT, (I'd go so far as to lay odds that you've never seen
&gt; Captain Eo), were the parallels mentioned by anyone when the show
&gt; was being produced?

      No, it's never come up before, and I think that's WAY stretching
it. (How come everybody always spends so much time trying to find out
what a show like B5 is *like* instead of just looking at it for what it
is?  "Oh, it's Cap'n Eo...oh, no, it's Lord of the Rings...Dune, Dune,
I tell you, it's Dune...no, it's this over here...no, it's Cap'n
Crunch...."

      Feh.
