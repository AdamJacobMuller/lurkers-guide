<H2>Joe an atheist?</H2>
<h3>Date: 16-May-96 02:31:40</h3>
<pre> Dimitri M LaBarge &lt;71501.3353@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is one set more valid just because it's got "production values"
&gt; and a storyline?

      Hrmmm...I dunno...maybe.  I'll have to think about it.  I guess
it's this particular topic, more than anything else, that has the
potential to polarize people the most, and B5 tends to be about
bringing folks together, not splitting them apart into camps.  We'll
see....

                                                                  jms
