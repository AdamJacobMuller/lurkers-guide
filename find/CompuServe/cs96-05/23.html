<H2>JMS: Quick Question</H2>
<h3>Date: 05-May-96 22:02:14</h3>
<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; When Sheridan and Ivanova are off galavanting about aboard the
&gt; White Star, who's minding the store on the station? Does
&gt; Garibaldi, as head of Security, run things, or would it be Delenn
&gt; as she's Sheridan's co-commander of the Rangers in that quadrant? 
&gt; Just what is the heirarchy of command on Babylon 5, now that it
&gt; is an independent state?

      Yeah, generally it would fall to Garibaldi; it's no longer a
rank thing as much as a "who can we trust?" question.  And Delenn
maintains control of the Rangers in their absence.

                                                                  jms
