<pre> A. Ellis &lt;74542.2467@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Please explain one minor thing I've missed: What does Sinclair
&gt; mean by asking Delenn whether SHE is "airtight?"

      It wasn't "airtight," it was "alright," which SHOULD have been
"all right," but the person writing the caption got it wrong.

      And thanks.

                                                                  jms
