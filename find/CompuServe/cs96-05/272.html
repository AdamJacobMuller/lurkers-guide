<pre> Meryl Yourish &lt;103470.2703@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; On a similar topic, do you have a favorite character?

      They're all favorites.  If I had to pick one, it might well be
Londo, simply because of the scope of the character, and what he lets
me write.

                                                                  jms
