<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Was John thinking about his role in the destruction of the Black
&gt; Star, or the fact that he is now leading every race he can
&gt; influence into (possibly suicidal) battle with the Shadows?

      In a way, each subsequent season tends to become stronger
because now you know who these people are.  If you come to care about
them, then the events that affect them have more power.  I've heard
from folks who've watched the first season or two over again, and now
that they know who these people are, found them much stronger than the
first time through.  It's the nature of the beast.

                                                                  jms
