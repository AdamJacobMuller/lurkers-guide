<pre> John M. Kahane &lt;102664.773@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; How difficult do you find it to change emotional strides when
&gt; writing stories like this? By the way, any chance I can get the
&gt; spelling for the two Narn words that mean "mindwalker" and
&gt; "destroyed" that Garibaldi mentioned at one point in that
&gt; discussion?

      No, it's never difficult for me to go from horror to romance to
comedy to action; they're just different colors in the artist's
toolbox...you go from red to blue to green to yellow, and it's not
difficult doing it, just in knowing *when* to do it, and *how* to do
it.

                                                                  jms
