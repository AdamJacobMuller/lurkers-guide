<pre> David Kuhn &lt;73532.741@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; So total human years + mimbari years not counting accidental
&gt; aging = well over a hundred years? Or did he live over a hundred
&gt; years as a mimbari?

      He lived close to a hundred years as a Minbari; they're a long
lived race, and they did all they could to maintain his health as one
of their truly great figures.

                                                                  jms
