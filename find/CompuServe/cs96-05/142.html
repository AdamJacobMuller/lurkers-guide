<pre> Meryl Yourish &lt;103470.2703@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Joe, one question about Kosh: Since the Shadows killed him, did
&gt; they see him in that now they know he was one of the Elder race? 
&gt; Or are they in the dark about the Vorlons?

      Oh, no, the Shadows and the Vorlons know each other from way,
way back.

                                                                  jms
