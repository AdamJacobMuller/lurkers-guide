<H2>B5 Story Arc</H2>
<h3>Date: 28-May-96 11:45:38</h3>
<pre> Alan Kaiser &lt;76003.1050@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; 1) When will we learn who Delenn saw in her flashfoward/flashback
&gt; (which?) when the door opens? 2) The reception here was not that
&gt; good...did the two vorlons we saw have Minbari faces? Are they
&gt; related? 3) When will we ever learn who built the Great Machine on
&gt; Epsilon? Has it a greater role to play in the story?
&gt; 4) If WWE could have been 3 episodes, would you have done it?
&gt; Will you be fleshing out many of those fragments down the road or
&gt; leave most of it "as it stands"?

       There's not much point to asking me "when are we going to learn
who Delenn saw in her flashforward."  Or similar questions.  I will not
throw away the impact of something happening in an episode by blowing
it out in a message.  There have to be surprises along the way.  You'll
see it when it happens.

       No, WWE couldn't have been 3 episodes.  Yes, it had enough
story for it, and then some, but you can't take one storyline and
stretch it out that far.  I wouldn't have done it even if I could. 
I'd've had to introduce a B story just to break it up a little, because
3 hours of just a straight line one-story plot is murder.  And that
defeats the purpose of expanding it.

                                                                  jms
