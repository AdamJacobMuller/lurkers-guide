<pre> Bill MacIntosh &lt;70275.1372@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; How do you explain this apparent inconsistency?
&gt; Have I (and at least one other B5 fan I have spoken with) simply
&gt; misunderstood Ivanova's character or are you implying that the
&gt; awesome might and destruction wrought by the Shadows would have
&gt; been enough to cause anyone to crack?

       With most of their systems down, everyone around her dead,
Sheridan dead, knowing she's about to die and there's nothing she can
do about it, and obviously knowing full well who's out there...about to
witness the deaths of a quarter million sentients on the station...I
felt a bit of an outburst, a final letting go of the emotions, was not
inappropriate for her. (Although I do think Claudia may have played it
a bit too hysterical at times; separate the lines from the performance
and look at it again.)

                                                                  jms
