<pre> Lynne Caulfield &lt;101647.2616@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; You're mad aren't you Joe?

       "...you have so many who never question your show that you're
not gonna miss me!"

       Lynne...here is where you show your stripes repeatedly in this
discussion.  There is a certain type of poster who is under the
curious assumption that only he or she questions me, or this show, and
everybody else is just a follower, never questioning.

       And it ain't true.  Believe me, I see more questions, go
through more heated drilling about this show than you can possibly
*begin* to imagine; no one here is in the least shy about expressing
their opinions if something doesn't strike them as being correct.

       Your comment here, as all have been to date, is
self-congratulatory when no such basis for congratulations exist.

                                                                  jms
