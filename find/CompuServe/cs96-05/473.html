      Thanks.  There's always a danger in trying too hard to teach, of
course, and I try to avoid that.  (It's just that I actually love
teaching.) Back a few years ago, when I still used to teach writing
here and there, I trained my class that when I started to go off and
start pontificating to excess, they were to say, as with one voice,
"Shuuuuuttt uppppp."

      Worked every time.

                                                                  jms
