<H2>Joe an atheist?</H2>

      Here's a little interesting aside...I used to write for Madeline
Murry O'Hare's magazine, AMERIAN ATHEIST, back when I was in college. 
I did a humor column, the occasional article, that sort of thing.

      But over time, I came to the conclusion that she wasn't just
trying to push for rights for atheists, but in fact was working to
*eliminate* religion, which I had a moral and ethical problem with. 
The constitution is there to allow anyone to believe, or not believe,
whatever they choose.  If the day comes when certain relgions are
banned, I'll be right there on the front lines with everybody else
fighting for the restoration of those rights (though I have a quiet
suspicion that the same might not happen if the situation were 
reversed).  I felt that this was supremely wrong, and resigned as a
result.

                                                                  jms
