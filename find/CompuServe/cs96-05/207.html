<H2>&gt;&gt;War Without End: 1&lt;&lt;</H2>
<h3>Date: 16-May-96 16:37:42</h3>
<pre> Terry Cotant [RSS] &lt;70313.1103@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; If what happened to Shariden was a "time" thing, how did get get
&gt; moved all the way from sector 14 to Centauri Prime? Must be
&gt; "time/space", not just "time", right?

       The time-flash (which in Sheridan's case is much more
pronounced than what we've seen before) slides you forward or backward
in time to where you are at that moment.  At that moment, 18 years from
now (in the story), Sheridan was/will be on Centauri Prime.  So when he
slid along the time line, that's where he ended up.  Just as in Babylon
Squared, when Garibaldi had a timeflash back to his time on Mars.  It
blips your perception to another point in your life, wherever you
happen to be.

                                                                  jms
