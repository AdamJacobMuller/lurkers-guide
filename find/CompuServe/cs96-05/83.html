<pre>{original post had no questions}

       Thanks.  Like I've said..if I *had* any answers, I'd be happy
to give them in an episode.  But all I have are questions.

       Television, as well as entertaining, should try where possible
to get us TO think, not tell us WHAT to think.

                                                                  jms
