      Actually...incorrect.  Whenever there's a timeflash, people see
one thing or another.  When Sinclair and Garibaldi first came aboard,
there was a timeflash.  We saw what Sinclair saw, we have no idea from
that scene what Garibaldi saw.  No reason he couldn't have seen
something from about that same period.  It wasn't stated either way at
the time.

                                                                  jms
