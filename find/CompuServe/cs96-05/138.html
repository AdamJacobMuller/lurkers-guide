<pre> Al Lipscomb &lt;75204.2225@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is any of this making any sense?

      Exactly.  That's a *very* good point; I'd forgotten about Romans
2:14. There are sections that imply that those who don't hear The
Gospels will be judged by their own actions and their own conscience,
which implies the presence of a conscience (as does the quote you cite)
even in the absence of a "transcendental" being, that is, knowing right
from wrong.  Excellent point.

      "...the largest problem we have in this country is that we have
moved from a justice system to a legal system."

      Wow...I've never heard that put so simply and so succinctly. 
And it's absolutely correct.  Nicely done.

                                                                  jms
