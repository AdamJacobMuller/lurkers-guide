      B5 is still a place of considerable commerce, access to lots and
lots of other races and diplomats...it serves Londo's purposes for now,
and there are probably lots of Centauri back home who would prefer he
stay here.  As for the rest...better the devil you know than the devil
you don't.  At least on B5 they can keep somewhat of an eye on him.

                                                                  jms
