      Re: G'Kar and Londo changing positions as Sinclair and Sheridan
have done, these two moving from certainty to uncertainty in either
direction, that ain't bad.  That ain't bad at *all*.  I like symmetry,
and both journeys are interesting explorations.  What I've been doing
in complex terms, you explained in an astonishingly few words.

                                                                  jms
