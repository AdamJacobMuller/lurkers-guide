<pre> Alan L. Ravitch &lt;73627.3126@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Just out of curiousity...was there something special (like you
&gt; know, a "celebrity request" for a part cause they like the show,
&gt; and/or what were the circumstances that led to East Coast Radio
&gt; Legend Cousin Bruce Morrow's part in WWE2?

      Thanks.  No, basically, he just kinda wanted to do it, and we
said sure.

                                                                  jms
