<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Was this the thing you did that caused everybody to avoid you at
&gt; lunch for two days?

      Yeah, it's funny, out of all the awful terrible things I've done
to our characters over these 3 years, the one that honked off the whole
crew was the Kosh development.  On one level, they loved it...loved how
it tightened the screws...but they still didn't want to know from me
for a day or two.

                                                                  jms
