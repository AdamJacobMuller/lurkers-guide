<pre> John M. Kahane &lt;102664.773@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; What was going on, who was this fellow, and what happened to him?
&gt; Who were these two species, have we seen them before, and are
&gt; they part of the League of Non-Aligned Worlds (given the hints of
&gt; their proximity to Brikiri space)?

      Thanks.  The two aliens in the start of the episode were a
Brakiri and a Gaim.

      "Interludes" for me marks a slight transition in the story, from
one "shape" to the next up...the demarkation between the hero-cycle and
the myth-cycle in the arc.

                                                                  jms
