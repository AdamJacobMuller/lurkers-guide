<pre> Robin L. Small &lt;76640.2012@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; was that a sort of "bleed-through" when he was recalling what
&gt; happened? or did that happen the first time, when he was being
&gt; interrogated at the battle of the line? If it's the latter, has
&gt; 'Sinclair knowing who delenn was before he ever met her' been
&gt; addressed yet??

      Yes, it was bleed-through.

                                                                  jms
