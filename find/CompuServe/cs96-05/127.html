      Which is pretty much what I told you would be the case by this
point. (Nobody ever believes me...do I have an untrustworthy face?  Do
I look like Robert Vesco trying to sneak back into the country
disguised as Moe Howard?)

      And yes, Bruce is a hell of a lot better than some folks were
willing to give him credit for in the beginning.  I think that's coming
out now as his role becomes more deep and more serious.

                                                                  jms
