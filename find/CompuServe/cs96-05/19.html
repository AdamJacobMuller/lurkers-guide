<pre> Bruno Melancon &lt;102647.3222@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt;  - Delenn-G'Kar confrontation - Bester helping the cause?
&gt;  - The War Room - Humans (or telepaths) merging with the Shadows
&gt; ships - The telepaths-weapons against the Shadows? About that last
&gt; point, can you tell me the name of the colony that is attacked by
&gt; the Shadows? Is it a human colony?
&gt; Clark be upset with the Shadows?

      That's Brakiri space they attacked; more on that in the next
episode. (They're a League world.)

                                                                  jms
