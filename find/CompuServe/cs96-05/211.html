<pre> Al Lipscomb &lt;75204.2225@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Any info on that project (I think you said 'GrimJack', I don't
&gt; get out much :) who is the author and when do you think it will
&gt; be out?

      I'm futzing around with several projects whilst awaiting word on
B5; nothing concrete I want to talk about just yet.  And I've grown a
beard since the photos you saw.

                                                                  jms
