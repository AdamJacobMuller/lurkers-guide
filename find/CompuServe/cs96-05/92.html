<pre> Julia E. Linthicum &lt;73114.3530@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Lennier as the "gentle alien"?
&gt; And Ivanova as "Sheridan's serious and comely colleague"?

      Thanks, actually it's an AP article that's appeared all over the

piece.

                                                                  jms
