      BTW, here's something to notice when you watch DTD again.  The
montage scene with Londo and G'Kar lasts, I think, 10 maybe 12 seconds.
But that one piece took John and me *hours* to put together.  Go
through frame by frame, and you'll see some of those bits are only 3 or
4 frames long (one second is 24 frames).  We were nearly blind by the
time we were done, but it was worth it.

                                                                  jms
