<h3>Date: 26-May-96 14:36:56</h3>
<pre> Linda B. Donahue &lt;104574.621@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; What does that mean?
&gt; Are they of the same fabric?
&gt; The same DNA?
&gt; Are we going to learn more about the Vorlons?
&gt; And are we going to find out more about who the Shadows are, and
&gt; what it is that they want? And how do humans tie into this (since
&gt; humans have a great destiny)? Any word on renewal yet?

      Thanks.  For now, I'll just say that you'll learn a LOT more
about the shadows, and their relations to the Vorlons, by the end of
the third season.

                                                                  jms
