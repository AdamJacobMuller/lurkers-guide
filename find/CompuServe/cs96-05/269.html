<pre> Daniel M. Upton &lt;75442.1331@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Even if the machine that Sinclare used was a copy where did the
&gt; knowledge come from to build it originally?

      Nope.  The machine came up with Zathras from Epsilon 3.  It
first appeared with Sinclair, then later got into Delenn's hands.  So
she still has that version of it.

                                                                  jms
