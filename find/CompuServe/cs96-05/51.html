<pre> John Ganofsky &lt;73354.1057@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; They were wondering how the makeup folks do the Centauri hair?

      All I know is that each Centauri hairpiece is hand-woven into
the fabric at an angle; you can't just take a wig and get it to stand
up, you have to *hand weave* it.  It's a fairly difficult and expensive
process.

                                                                  jms
