<pre> Casey J. Peter &lt;73453.2074@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Any non Vorlon thoughts on that?

      Thanks.  Lurker's pulled the flash because it ain't so, and I
indicated as much to them.  Obviously they're eager, and want for good
news to come soon, as do we all, so they can't be faulted for
enthusiasm.

                                                                  jms
