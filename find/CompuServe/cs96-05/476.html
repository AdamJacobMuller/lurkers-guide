<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;70530.2521@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Which is correct, or are they both correct?
&gt; How old (in standard/Earth years) is Delenn anyway?

      I think it's the difference between serving the council in
general, and being *on* the Council.

      (That's my story and I'm sticking to it.)

                                                                  jms
