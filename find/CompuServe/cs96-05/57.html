<pre> Richard M. Perry &lt;76461.2737@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; What's next, little miniture Shadow ships painted on the side or
&gt; will we see the jackets first? BTW, did someone at WB get a clue
&gt; (or replaced by RMES)?

      Thanks, and that's great to hear about the station's reaction. 
It's a very hopeful sign, as is the increased advertising from WB.

                                                                  jms
