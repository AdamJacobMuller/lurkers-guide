<h3>Date: 06-May-96 21:44:35</h3>
<pre> Troy Starr &lt;74752.3172@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Dare one ask what's happened to the two reporters that were
&gt; broadcasting from the ISN news center when "ISN pulled it's own
&gt; plug to stop the fake trasmission?" Would people believe that
&gt; their (well, his) report was a fake? Finally, is ISN the only
&gt; channel out there?

      ISN is one of the only interstellar networks bounced via the
tachyon relay systems from Earth to the outer colonies and beyond. 
There are lots of other channels back home, but to get this far out you
need the support of the government.

      The other two reporters are, to say the least, in deep guano.

                                                                  jms
