<pre> Douglas Files Fox &lt;74020.3260@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Had Geribaldi's "found pin" suffered the same fate as Bester's
&gt; pin? Is the addition of the Cyber- Implants, the "Preparation"
&gt; Delenn was refering to in "Messages from Earth"? The crew members
&gt; of the Icarus, who didn't go along, were they used as Shadow ship
&gt; "Central Cores"? So I was wondering if Sheridan's wife could have
&gt; been used as a "Core" of one of the Shadow Ships?

      Yes, the implants are part of the preparation process Delenn
referred to in "Messages."  As for the rest...only time will tell,
cause sure as hell I ain't....

                                                                  jms
