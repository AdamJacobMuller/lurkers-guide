<H2>Sinclair's Scar &amp; More</H2>
<h3>Date: 23-May-96 17:33:33</h3>
<pre> Linda B. Donahue &lt;104574.621@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Where did Sinclair's scar come from in WwE?
&gt; Is it a Sinclair scar, or an O'Hare scar?
&gt; Was this because he had a feeling he knew Sinclair's destiny...or
&gt; did he just have gas?

       The scar came during ranger training.

       Marcus's look came because he overheard the Minbari-language
part of the discussion, and knew something was up.  It made him more
watchful of Sinclair, which pays off in WWE2.

                                                                  jms
