<pre> D.N. Cid (UK) &lt;101647.250@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I was wondering if this was indeed intentional?

      Thanks.  Yes, we do try and cast from a variety of backgrounds,
and allow for different accents and the like.  We haven't done as much
as I'd like, I think we did more in season 3 than in 2, but I still
think we can do more of it.

                                                                  jms
