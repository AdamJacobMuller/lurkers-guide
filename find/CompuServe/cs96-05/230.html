<pre> Shane S. Shellenbarger &lt;104305.3404@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Joe, Has the B5 Screen Saver been released in a Mac version yet?

      I've been told that the early decision to do a Mac version
wasn't actually a decision, but a thought experiment, and for now
they're staying with a PC version.

                                                                  jms
