<pre> David Cerreta &lt;72630.3433@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Were there any hints?
&gt; Why halfway through our story do the Shadows show their hand?
&gt; What is that agenda?
&gt; Are the Shadows independent operators or do *they* answer to
&gt; somebody?

      Good points.  In general, you always know when I'm going to
start answering a question, because I begin to point at it in episodes;
I'm now beginning to point to the shadows and ask, "What do THEY want?"

      The answer is coming.

                                                                  jms
