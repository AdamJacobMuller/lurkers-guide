<pre> Carol Naylor &lt;100645.2613@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Quick question - is the "rebirth ceremony" from Parliament of
&gt; Dreams what we would have seen had the full ceremony gone ahead
&gt; in Ceremonies of Light and Dark or are there several different
&gt; versions - each with their own significance? Did you know that he
&gt; used to be a monk?

      Yes, it's the same ceremony; Delenn states as much in the
episode.

                                                                  jms
