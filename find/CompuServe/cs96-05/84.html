<pre> Chad Underkoffler &lt;102512.1310@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; So Bob the PsiCop *can't* scan someone behind them?
&gt; What about through a closed door?
&gt; Could Bob scan Mike if he knew Mike was in the next room over?
&gt; Would Bob know it was really Jill instead of Mike in the room?
&gt; I guess the ultimate question is, if I sneak up behind Bobin the
&gt; hallway, wearing a chameleon suit and really quiet shoes, will he
&gt; know I'm there Psiwise? If so, will he be able to scan me?
&gt; What if I duck behind a corner, outta LOS; can he still scan me?
&gt; Is it "seeing" or "knowing"?

       No, if the person is behind a door, or otherwise can't be
located visually, it's difficult to impossible to scan.

                                                                  jms
