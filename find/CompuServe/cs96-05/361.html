<pre> Jim De Vico &lt;72662.2765@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; What will you be tying up then?
&gt; Something else that this brings to mind is how many others in
&gt; your field want to tell a story this way, yet can't because they
&gt; don't have the gumption?

      Thanks (and I loved Watchmen myself).  It's certainly my hope
that our success with this will encourage others to follow in our
footsteps.

                                                                  jms
