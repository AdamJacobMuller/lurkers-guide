<pre> Brian A. Thomas &lt;75231.1122@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Congrtulations on creating the single greatest hour in television
&gt; history, and it's supposed to get better?! Will that be explained
&gt; soon? 2) The fact that the Vorlons tiped their hat, and made it
&gt; known that they were involved with the Shadow war, seems to bid
&gt; ill, as in a previouse ep I seem to recall Delenn or Kosh
&gt; remarking how they don't have enouph forces gatherd...or am I
&gt; remembering wrong?

       Actually, no, I never said that we'd show a vorlon as a vorlon
this season; in time, yes, but not this season.

                                                                  jms
