<pre> SysOp Dupa T Parrot &lt;70040.104@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Why did Morden have to open the door to Kosh's quarters before
&gt; his Shadowy friends could attack Kosh? Are the Shadows a variety
&gt; of Teep?

      No, they're not a variety of teep.

                                                                  jms
