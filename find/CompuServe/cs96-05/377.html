<pre> Toni Muller &lt;75223.1575@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Well, physics was not one of my strong suits, but I have to
&gt; wonder if it is more a question of the limitations of our current
&gt; timing or photograpy equipment? How did they "prove" both existed
&gt; simultaneously?

       I dunno, but I'm *reasonably* sure there was math involved.

                                                                  jms
