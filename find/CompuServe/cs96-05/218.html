<H2>&lt;WWE - timeline ?&gt;</H2>
<h3>Date: 16-May-96 22:34:00</h3>
<pre> Michael Beemer &lt;71551.1670@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Did you work out in your head the sequence of events that created
&gt; the circular timeline, or did you just throw up your hands and
&gt; say, "Who cares about explaining it?

      No, it all has to hang together, or it's kinda useless.  It just
required working out the details of what was, is, and will be.  Then I
walked on water....

                                                                  jms
