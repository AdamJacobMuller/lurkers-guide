<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; * So is the NightWatch done for now?
&gt; (such as another assault on the station by EA forces)?
&gt; * Is Corwin and everyone else on the B5 command staff cool with
&gt; B5's seccession now?

      All I'll say for now is that we'll obviously have to get back
into the Earth situation sooner or later; that still has to be dealt
with.

                                                                  jms
