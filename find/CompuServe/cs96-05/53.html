<H2>JMS: 'Drop Dead' Date?</H2>
<h3>Date: 07-May-96 18:41:54</h3>
<pre> Daniel M. Upton &lt;75442.1331@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Does the fact that one of the prizes in the recent "Mystery Alien
&gt; Contest" was the chance to play an alien in an upcoming episode
&gt; mean that they are more likely to renew the show?

      Doesn't really affect the odds either way; there's always an out
in these kinds of things.

                                                                  jms
