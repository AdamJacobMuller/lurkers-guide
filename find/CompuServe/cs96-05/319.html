<pre> Meryl Yourish &lt;103470.2703@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Was the white ray (or whatever) in WWE1related to the being that
&gt; got inside Sheridan during "Knives," or was it just the effect of
&gt; blowing up a fusion reactor?

      No, that was just the result of the blast.

                                                                  jms
