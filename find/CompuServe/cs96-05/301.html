<pre> Cathy Holley &lt;75204.1515@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Then if I told you that God always existed, you'd tell me that
&gt; matter has always existed as well?

      Yup.  In one form or another, one Big Bang leading to a
collapse, and another Big Bang...if one can say god has always existed,
then one can equally say that perhaps the universe has always existed,
in one form or another....

                                                                  jms
