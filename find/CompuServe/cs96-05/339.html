<pre> Linda B. Donahue &lt;104574.621@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; How did he get so...Vorlon-like in such a short period of time?

      He was kinda Zen when he left, frankly...and two years living
among Minbari, learning their language, learning to think the way they
do, learning the whole history of the shadow war...that can have a
pretty profound effect on you.  It obviously wasn't all hanging around
the Hyatt Minbar and watching reruns of I Love Lennier for two
years....

                                                                  jms
