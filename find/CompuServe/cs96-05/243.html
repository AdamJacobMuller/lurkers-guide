<H2>&lt;War Without End, Pt 1&gt;</H2>
<h3>Date: 18-May-96 00:54:04</h3>
<pre> Matthew D. Woudstra &lt;71073.540@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; How long can one person wear the same outfit???
&gt; say, one of the principle players, one with a bony head crest and
&gt; long black hair...?

      Actually, Delenn probably has more outfits than just about
anyone else; there's the blue outfit, the rose colored outfit, the
green active-wear look, her grey cloak and white religious caste robes,
one more change of color...so I think your observation here is flawed.

                                                                  jms
