<H2>How Time Flies</H2>
<h3>Date: 26-May-96 14:36:59</h3>
<pre>      I've been going over my notes on the show, and just thought I'd
pass this along to the newer folks to show just how long this show has
been in the works.  In looking it all over, I'm already kind of
astonished at how large a chunk of my life this thing has consumed
already.

      1986: Babylon 5 is thunk up.

      1987: Pilot screenplay and series treatment written, artwork
commissioned.

      1987-1991: Five years wandering in the desert of studios and
networks, trying to sell B5.

      June 1991: We place Babylon 5 with PTEN.

      October 1991: B5 announced to the world.

      August 1992: Filming begins on B5 pilot movie.

      September 1992: Filming completed on B5 pilot, post production
starts.

      February 1993: Pilot airs.

      February 1994: First season begins airing.

      It's odd sometimes to consider that though this is the 3rd
season of Babylon 5, it's been a part of my life for 10 years, about
25% of my life; trying to sell it, selling it, making it.  And this
month marks about 5 years since we placed it with PTEN.

      Jeez, but that's a long haul....

                                                                  jms
