<H2>WB vs. Drop Dead?</H2>
<h3>Date: 25 Feb 1997 22:24:53 -0700</h3>
<pre> Kevin P. Kenney &lt;104102.352@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Do you have a feeling yet whether WB/PTEN will be willing to give
&gt; you an answer on renewal and/or the sequel after this week's
&gt; numbers come out and get digested? If not, do you know this year's
&gt; 'drop dead' date on renewal?

      The renewal dates for the actors is the same every year, around
late June/early July.

                                                                  jms
