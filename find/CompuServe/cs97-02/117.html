<pre> Jean S McKnight &lt;105513.130@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I was just wondering what sort of software you use to write
&gt; scripts, and if you use something different for novels?

      I use Movie Master for scripts; it's a formatting program only. 
It's quirky and buggy as hell, but it's what I learned to use at
Universal, and it's functional.  I use Wordstar for regular prose.

                                                                  jms
