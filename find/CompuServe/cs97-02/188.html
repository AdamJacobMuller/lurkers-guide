<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;75063.3305@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Do you have any idea why bluescreen would do that sort of thing
&gt; to some colors? And, is there anything that can be done to avoid
&gt; it?

       I think they had to tweak the color in the transfer to avoid
the problem of blue against blue, and having the virtual set bleed
through.

                                                                  jms
