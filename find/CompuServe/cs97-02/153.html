      Thanks...yeah, a number of folks have come around to that. 
That's one more reason why I wanted to get the war out of the
way...because too many people were focusing in on the show as being
about the war.  It ain't.  It's about the changes that happen before,
during, and *after* a war.  And what's coming up is in some ways
stronger because it's more personal.

                                                                  jms
