<pre> Frank J. Furfaro &lt;74031.1005@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Were you aware that these were going to be on and chose them, or
&gt; did WB just include them in the show?

      NUTS!  I missed it!  I knew it was coming, but didn't know it
was tonight.  NUTS!

                                                                  jms
