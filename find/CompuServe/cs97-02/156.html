<pre> Rebecca Eschliman &lt;76072.2345@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I'm just curious, is this because the here-and-now is too
&gt; confining for the stories you want to tell, or SF allows you to
&gt; play with what we know in the here-and-now more effectively,
&gt; or...?

      I tend to lean toward SF because that's what gets caught in my
filter. I'm an SF fan.  Always have been.  I like other genres, and
tend to play with them from time to time, but SF remains my first and
foremost love.

                                                                  jms
