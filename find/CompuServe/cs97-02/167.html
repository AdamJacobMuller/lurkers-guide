<pre> Phyllis Schmulenson &lt;72447.224@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Do you plan to put Babylon5 into prose form (three novels I would
&gt; think) or do you think trying to translate into another media
&gt; from TV film would basterize it?

      My feeling is, if I'd wanted to do 'em as books, I'd've done 'em
as books.  The story was designed for TV, and that's probably the best
place to leave it.

                                                                  jms
