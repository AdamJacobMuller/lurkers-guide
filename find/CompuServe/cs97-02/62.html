<pre> Andrew Diseker &lt;70714.105@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Was it your intention for the Vorlon and Shadow reps that
&gt; appeared on White Star #2's bridge to sound, well, plaintive,
&gt; when they were talking to Lorien? Will the loss of the First Ones
&gt; be equally traumatic, in the story that comes after? Will some of
&gt; the characters begin to realize just what it means to really be
&gt; in charge, now?

      Thanks.  There is a definite parent/child/parent dynamic going
on there, in that Lorien is, in a way, in that role to the Vorlons and
the Shadows, they're in that role to us, and we're in that role to
those who will follow. It's the endless cycle.

                                                                  jms
