<pre> Catherine Becic &lt;73414.2603@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Are these guys for real?
&gt; Did I miss the description of what facility they are talking
&gt; about? make a reservation, but is this legit?
&gt; thing out?
&gt; crew, JMS, etc?
&gt; What do you know of this?

       My knowledge and association is at some distance.  I met with
some of the people putting this together while I was in Florida, and
they include a number of folks who have been long-time online
supporters of B5, who apparently have a good background running
conventions.  I know that they are making a honest effort of this, and
are doing all they can to make it a good convention.  Beyond that, I
can't say that we're actively involved in it. It has all the earmarks
of something that would work out, but I have no way of knowing that,
any more than any other first-time convention...except to know the
intentions of the people, which are good, and their experience, which 
seems to be solid.

                                                                  jms
