<pre> Douglas Piligian &lt;70760.2440@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Was it?

       Thanks for the kind words.

       No, no relation to Ivanova's outfit.  I just wanted a sense of
something that was both ancient and ageless, frozen, formal, distant.

                                                                  jms
