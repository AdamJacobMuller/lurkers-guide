<pre> Stuart C. Hellinger &lt;70402.1371@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I apologize in advance if you were already asked this (I haven't
&gt; had the time to log on this week), but was it deliberate that the
&gt; end credit music for the "The Long Night" went back to the third
&gt; season theme?

       It was an error...but as with many errors on the show, it
worked to our benefit.  It's the ABA principle....Art By Accident.

                                                                  jms
