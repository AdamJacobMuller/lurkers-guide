<pre> Jean S McKnight &lt;105513.130@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Does that mean you look like Peirce Brosnan in person?

      On very rare occasions you may get a shot where I look
relatively human, but they're few and far between.  The camera loves
Harlan, on the other hand, who always looks great in shots.  Me, every
time my photo comes out somewhere, America's Most Wanted gets calls....

                                                                  jms
