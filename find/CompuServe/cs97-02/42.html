<pre> Derek Linden &lt;73322.2517@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; If he had not gone as Delenn warned, could Sheridan have avoided
&gt; that future? Or was it already set in stone, as you seem to
&gt; suggest? I find that amazing...why do you do it, if you don't mind
&gt; my asking?

       Had he not gohne to Z'ha'dum, he would've avoided that fate,
but caused another.  And yeah, I answer most questions that require a
response.

                                                                  jms
