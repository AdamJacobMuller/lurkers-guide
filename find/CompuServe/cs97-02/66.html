      Won't make any difference.  WB Video doesn't release *any* TV
series on tape or disk; that it would make money, it seems, doesn't
matter...they only want to be involved with the high-visiblity
big-budget sure-hit movies, not piddly TV shows.  So all the letters in
the world -- and they've received a lot of them -- apparently won't
make any difference to these people.

                                                                  jms
