<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; I assume they were the names of real directors, writers, and
&gt; actors who were blacklisted?

      Yes, they're based on the real names of writers who were
blacklisted, Dalton Trumbo and Paul Jarrico.

                                                                  jms
