&gt; * I think it's about time our Minister / Regent got a name, don't
&gt; you? After the Great Bab5 Computer Reboot (starring Sparky the
&gt; Wonder Computer), was the SPIDER IN THE WEB Control erased from
&gt; Bab5's files? Wasn't / Isn't Mars owned by a company, kinda?
&gt; Maybe he had tasted what the two of them could do when they
&gt; worked together instead of at each other's throat? Boy, he got
&gt; shut down hard a couple few times by Lyta, didn't he? A taste of
&gt; Martyrdom? Maybe her and Alfie, y'know, "wink-wink, nudge-nudge,
&gt; say no more"? I seemingly recall a mention somewhere by Pat
&gt; Tallman that Lyta was a lesbian, or bisexual? Is that canon, or
&gt; just something Pat said at a convention? And ObObviousQuestion:
&gt; How *much* has she been modified? A telepath would be real handy
&gt; for removing that stuff, don'tcha think? How immortal (for 20 yrs)
&gt; is he? More importantly, how immortal does he feel?
&gt; Rage Ranger of Washingdome "I assume my usual quarters in the
&gt; brig are available?

       The only thing I'd quibble with there is calling Garibaldi's
trust of Jack in season 1 a massive screwup...he had no way of knowing
what was going on, nobody did, viewers included, until it happened.

                                                                  jms
