<pre>       No, the Netter release DOES NOT specifically state that there
will not be a season 5.  It talks about the current 88 episodes in the
can, which TNT wants to go with asap, but we've been told by WB that a
concurrent airing of season 5 and the TNT reruns is a possibility, so
it's still in the discussion process.

                                                                  jms
