<pre> Jean S McKnight &lt;105513.130@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I've heard that you often appear in LA but I can't travel there
&gt; (afraid of turning into a pillar of salt, don't you know), and
&gt; wondered if you are planning to make any appearances in or near
&gt; the (wholesome, inexpensive and friendly!) midwest this year? I've
&gt; been checking the Zocalo and everything else I can find, but hope
&gt; I might have missed something?

       Nothing in the midwest...Columbus Ohio, Orlando Florida,
Tauntaun Mass, Long Island NY, Seattle, WA...wanted to do Chicago
ComicCon this year, but the timetable doesn't work out, and Westercon
got there first for Seattle as GoH.

                                                                  jms
