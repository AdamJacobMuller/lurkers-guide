<pre> Ray Pelzer &lt;70475.1263@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; ....have you ever considered the fact that between Jeff Conaway,
&gt; Stephen Furst, and several others, you've made B5 into a haven
&gt; where unappreciated and typecast actors have been able to shine
&gt; with their respective skills while flipping a thespian finger at
&gt; all those who've ignored them?

      That sometimes occurs to me....

      They're all fine actors who've been vastly underappreciated,
under utilized, and typecast.  We don't cater to that.

                                                                  jms
