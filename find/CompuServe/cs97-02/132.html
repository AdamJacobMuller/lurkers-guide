<h3>Date: 17 Feb 1997 21:43:40 -0700</h3>
<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;75063.3305@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Can you clarify the timeline for the first eight episodes?
&gt; Does that mean that 407 ("Epiphanies") happened sometime in Feb,
&gt; March or April?

      There are always some time jumps in the show, since there's only
22 weeks worth of shows, and they cover 52 weeks of a year.

                                                                  jms
