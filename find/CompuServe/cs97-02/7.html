      Thanks; we put in a LOT of time in the music and sound design of
the show, more than most shows.  I'm glad it shows.

      Ironically, though, the company doing the satellite uplink was
changed recently (we have no control over this) and they're now
uplinking the show in *analog* rather than digital, so there's some
frazzing now that limits the dynamic range just a tad.

                                                                  jms
