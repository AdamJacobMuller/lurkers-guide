<pre> John Bovenmyer &lt;73567.1341@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Am I correct that Dukhat is the first Minbari we've seen with
&gt; facial hair? Is that important?
&gt; Did Sinclair/Valen ever realize Delenn's heritage?
&gt; Might this newly mentioned mystery about Valen's end foreshadow
&gt; it's resolution in future episodes? Did I hear correctly that
&gt; Calenn is Delenn's brother and they had other brothers die along
&gt; with Dukhat?

       No, Calenn was not Delenn's brother; the grey councilor speaks
of brothers in the generic sense.

       Draal, in his first appearance, also had a small beard.

       And thanks....

                                                                  jms
