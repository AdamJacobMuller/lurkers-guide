<pre> Deonaha M. Conlin &lt;102531.2627@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Was it my drug-induced haze, or was the voice of the shadow
&gt; creature done by Ed Wasser?

      Yeah, that was Ed's voice.  Seemed appropos.

      Definitely didn't want it to end in a big explosion.  We've seen
many of those; how many more can you see?  One is the same as the other
after a while. And if we destroyed everything, how would that show we'd
grown enough to create the new age?  It's a matter of evolution, not
destruction.

                                                                  jms
