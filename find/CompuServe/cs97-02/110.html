       Yeah, but I think I want to hold that for a big con...my
problem is, once I tell a story ANYwhere, it's on the nets in 50
seconds, and I can't tell it anywhere else without boring my audience
to tears.  So I'm looking for ways to spread stuff around.

                                                                  jms
