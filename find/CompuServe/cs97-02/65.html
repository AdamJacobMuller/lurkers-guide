<pre> Mark Honeyborne &lt;106531.647@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; If they are not is there any chance of them being put onto a CD
&gt; single perhaps with Vir and Londo's rendishion of a Centari song
&gt; that they sung on KNIVES?

      There was never any alternate version of "War," only my notes.

      The songs will surface somewhere, eventually, I'm sure.

                                                                  jms
