<pre> David Belt &lt;72142.1365@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; The next novel?
&gt; You mean there is something coming after Othersyde?

      Yeah, I started my next novel...it's going to be a slow haul,
because I still have to give B5 my primary concern, but I've been going
batty not doing some prose work, and I decided I finally had to start
it, just for my own soul.

                                                                  jms
