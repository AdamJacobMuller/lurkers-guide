<pre> Meryl Yourish &lt;103470.2703@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Are we supposed to think that you believe all reporters are
&gt; slime, or is it just the slant that they've been given in B5
&gt; episodes? So I guess my main questions are these: What is your
&gt; attitude on the press? And will you ever portray reporters in a
&gt; good light?

      No, I don't make any blanket condemnations of journalists.  For
one thing, there's a difference between portraying journalism in a
relatively free society, and one that's operating under a dictatorship,
a la President Clark. It's the difference between journalism and
propaganda.

      In "Midnight on the Firing Line," we had a reporter there doing
a straight-ahead story; in "Point of No Return" we had the Good
Journalists fighting to reveal the truth even as Clark was shutting
them down.

      There have been favorable portrayals; it's just that under the
current regime, they don't have access to the media.

                                                                  jms
