<H2>Epi - Lyta &amp; Sheridan</H2>
<h3>Date: 14 Feb 1997 15:51:21 -0700</h3>
<pre> Colin Glassey &lt;104224.2227@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; First, the jump seems huge, how could he think that she had
&gt; anything to do with it? I've done so many things for you, and what
&gt; have you done for me? You aren't my commanding officer."?

       No, Lyta doesn't officially work for Sheridan, but she has
nowhere else to go, and is beholden to him just for everyday survival
and protection against the Corps.  That makes her answerable to him.

                                                                  jms
