<pre> Rebecca Eschliman &lt;76072.2345@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Since he has rejected the easy sole leadership, what position can
&gt; he create for himself in the face of woefully uncomprehending
&gt; followers?

      Thanks...that's a lot to keep in play at the same time, and I'm
glad the themes all come across.

                                                                  jms
