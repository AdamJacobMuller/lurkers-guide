<pre> Jean S McKnight &lt;105513.130@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Are there any other Kathryn Drennan books available?
&gt; Does she have an Email address for fan mail?

       While she has written prose for Twilight Zone magazine, and
other national publications, and is a Clarion graduate, this will mark
her first novel.  It's quite good (having read most of it now),
tracking Sinclair's journey from B5 to Minbar, taking up the role of
Ambassador, then transitioning to head of the Rangers.

       This book stands to be the first one (closely followed by
Jeanne Cavelos' forthcoming B5 book) that's 100% canon...to be
considered a true chapter in the B5 storyline.

       What's fun about it is that it ties all the books and comics
together with the show, and puts it all in chronological order, and
weaves in and out of events in the second season.  I think this is
going to be a fan favorite. The Cavelos book follows Anna Sheridan as
she comes to join the crew of the Icarus, and the details of their fate
at Z'ha'dum.

                                                                  jms
