      Sinclair was never intended to go to Z'ha'dum.

      And it wouldn't have worked for Sakai to be the one who awoke
the shadows and "died" at Z'ha'dum because *they were already awake* in
the first season.  People who try to lay the one line atop the other
tend to forget this.  We also get Garibaldi's mention of crawling out
of the Martian desert in the very first episode...which tied into the
whole Messages From Earth thread, putting the shadows at work for at
least 2-3 years.

                                                                  jms
