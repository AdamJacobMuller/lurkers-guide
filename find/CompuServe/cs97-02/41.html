<pre> Derek Linden &lt;73322.2517@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; But does Ivanova go down in mortal terror, wanting desparately to
&gt; live? But maybe I don't fully understand her--perhaps fear has
&gt; always been a major part of her life after all...either that, or
&gt; maybe she escapes the C&amp;C? Does it?
&gt; Or can Sinclair, by his goodness, prevent such things as he
&gt; determined to do in "War w/o End"?

      Guess we'll just have to wait and see....
