<pre> Toni Muller &lt;75223.1575@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is he going to regret having spoken to and threatened her the way
&gt; he did?

      Thanks...yeah, the rest of the season will actually continue to
increase in intensity, not decrease.  "Epiphanies" for me is an episode
where I can feel the gears changing between war and post-war just a
bit, but overall it's not bad.  And there's some *mean* stuff coming up
very soon.

                                                                  jms
