<pre> Richard M. Perry &lt;76461.2737@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; On a related note, have you seen the latest issue of Sci-Fi
&gt; Invasion? Needless to say this caught my eye, so I read the entire
&gt; article so I could get it in the right context, I mean no one
&gt; would be that bold, right?

      So by Hans logic, any series of novels, like the Dune books or
anything else, is "limited by the imagination" of the person
responsible, and thus flawed...or Herbert was just full of it...same
for Tolkein, Clarke, Asimov, Smith and others.

      I think this is what's called a classic case of projection.

                                                                  jms
