<pre> Russ Herschler &lt;76300.1071@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; From a legal standpoint, is there any possibility of them
&gt; licenceing Babylon 5 to another video company for release
&gt; (Columbia House or some such company...)?

      We've been after them to do this, but so far it's "Well, no, we
don't want to do them, but we don't want anyone else to do them either
because it's our territory and if anyone should do them it's us, we
just don't want do do them."

      Nothing new there..."People will do what they will do even
though you should burst."  Marcus Aurelieus
