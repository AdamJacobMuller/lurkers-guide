      I think a lot of SF writers stayed with it because of
familiarity.  SF writers, and folks like me (still not entirely sure if
I belong in that category), were invariably the first ones on our block
to have personal computers...back when that meant a Kaypro II with 64K
ram and 128K floppies and NO internal hard drive, and an 8" green
monitor.  (I still have mine, incidentally, I'm too sentimental to
throw it away.)

      Back then, Wordstar was pretty much the way to go.  That's what
I learned on, and that's why I use it.  I like the WYSIWYG approach,
and it does feel like a typewriter.

      The WS for Windows was a nightmare, and I deleted it instantly. 
Is there any indication that they're going to be trying again any time
soon? I'd like to use the capability that comes with windows, but I'm
too short on time to afford the learning curve for another software
system.

                                                                  jms
