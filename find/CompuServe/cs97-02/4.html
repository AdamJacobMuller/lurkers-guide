<pre> Martin Toggweiler &lt;74041.2400@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is it true that each B5 season was planned for 26 eps instead of
&gt; 22 in case one of the major networks picked it up? Are there
&gt; "lost" B5 eps that may surface some time in the misty future like
&gt; some long lost Beatles tracks?

"Is it true that each B5 season was planned for 26 eps instead of 22
in case one of the major networks picked it up?  A friend told me that
he heard this was the case and that there are a number of entire eps
that were written and filmed, but have never aired with no plan to air
them anytime soon.  Are there "lost" B5 eps that may surface some time
in the misty future like some long lost Beatles tracks?"

      Nope, nope, and nope.

                                                                  jms
