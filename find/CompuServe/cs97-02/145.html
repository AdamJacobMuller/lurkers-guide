<pre> Jose Cabanillas &lt;71020.3316@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Who came up with that perspective, and was this change of tone
&gt; set totally in the writing or did it get enhanced on the set? Had
&gt; he done any directing before?

      Stephen has directed before, yes, though he hasn't done that
much episodic TV work.

      The final shot was strictly described in the script; the monitor
POV, the relative positions of everyone, the slight fisheye look and
the absolute silence.

                                                                  jms
