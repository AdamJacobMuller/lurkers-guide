      He asked if Ericsson was married because, if he was, that was a
call that Sheridan would have to make, over Stellarcom or in person, to
notify her that her husband was dead.  And, for Sheridan, I suppose
there was a tinge of relief, knowing that at least he wouldn't be
creating a widow as well as ordering Ericsson to do what was necessary.

                                                                  jms
