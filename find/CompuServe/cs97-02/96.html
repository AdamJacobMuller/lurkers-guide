<pre> Jonathan Kass &lt;74130.443@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; 1) Level of Vorlon impact on the known races - can we assume that
&gt; Londo's inability to see Kosh in TFON was a reflection of the
&gt; fact that the Vorlons _never_ interfered with the development of
&gt; the Centauri people? Was this intentional - natural abilities
&gt; exceed what the Vorlons seemed to be handing out?

       It's a combination of elements, Londo's fall, and yes, the
Vorlons had a very minimal affect on the Centauri, they never were able
to get a really strong foothold there.

                                                                  jms
