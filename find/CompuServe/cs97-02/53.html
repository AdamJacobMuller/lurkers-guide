      Someone once said that writing involves constantly proving you
have talent to those who have none.  But some suits don't want to admit
that, and figure, if they can hold a pencil, they can write.  Because
they have no respect for writers or the written word.  So they screw
with it. Constantly. Which is why I consider myself very lucky with B5,
in that they have left me alone and not interfered.

                                                                  jms
