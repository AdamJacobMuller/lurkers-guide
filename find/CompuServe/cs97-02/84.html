<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Do we ask the EFX to sign autographs?
&gt; Do we go to conventions for laser light shows and things
&gt; exploding? And HE didn't get fired, did he?
&gt; Do you know what the latest of this is, from "inside"?
&gt; Are any of Doohan's buddies sticking up for him?
&gt; Is he protesting this?
&gt; Is Paramount getting truckloads of mail in protest?

      There's nothing more new on this in the trades, which is all I
know about it...everybody rolled over, apparently, and that's that.

                                                                  jms
