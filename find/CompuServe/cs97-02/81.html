      Thanks.  You pick up on a lot of good stuff.  I've suggested the
use of a minor chords version of the theme music to Chris on several
occasions, where it seemed right, here, Signs and Portents, and in
others.  The change from minor to major chords does signal an emotional
transition, and it works well.

      The director initially didn't want to do the Londo rage scene in
one take; it was something I felt very strongly about, and I think it
works well.

      BTW, there's another example of a long single take coming up
soon, on Epsilon 3, which is all I'll specify.  I kinda wanted the
scene to play itself out, without cutting, and to show just how
amazingly capable some of our actors can be.  We're talking here almost
4 minutes of footage, not one cut in the whole thing, very fast
dialogue, and not a single muffed line, with the performances working
wonderfully.  You'll know it when you see it.

                                                                  jms
