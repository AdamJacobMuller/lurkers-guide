<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Joe: In the final scene where we see an image of both the Vorlon
&gt; and the Shadows, why did you not show us the Vorlon in its true
&gt; form without the encounter suit?

      Because we'd still be rendering it.  There are 114 EFX shots in
that episode, and as it was we just barely made the satellite uplink. 
If it wasn't absolutely necessary, better to do it more simply.  As it
was, we were rendering the shadow form too.

                                                                  jms
