<pre> Meryl Yourish &lt;103470.2703@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; On the first viewing, like Marcus, I was thinking, "Was that it?"
&gt; But how can they still ask for that, when we discovered how
&gt; all-powerful the desire to be proven right was for each of the
&gt; Old Ones? The last scene, when the Shadow asked Lorien if he would
&gt; come with them, and when the Vorlon said, "Then we will not be
&gt; alone?" You have so many tragic figures in this story--Londo,
&gt; G'Kar, Sheridan, Garibaldi--leave us some room for joy before you
&gt; wrap, will you?

      Thanks.  You definitely hit a lot of the symbolism right on the
head. One could almost argue for the whole scene as a classic
"intervention" out of psychotherapy or group counseling.

      Very early on, John Copeland asked me, "Okay, bottom line it for
me, what's the war about?"  I said, "It's about killing your parents." 
And his eyes went wide, and I explained, "No, not literally...but at
some point you have to step outside the control of your parents and
create your own life, your own destiny.  That process is
inevitable...and if there are indeed older races, and they're
interfering, that puts them smack in the middle of that same process."

      It's not about who has the biggest gun, because there's *always*
somebody else with a bigger gun...it's about *understanding* your way
out of a problem.

                                                                  jms
