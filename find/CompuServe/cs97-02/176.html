<pre>{original post had no questions}

      I could answer this, but if I expand the time paradox loop any
further, I would end up not answering it because I'd already answered
it, which means it wouldn't get answered, requiring me to answer it
now, and pretty soon the universe implodes, and I don't want that on my
conscience.

                                                                  jms
