<pre> Scott Baker &lt;76072.1744@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; The other siblings of the newlyweds (Psi Corp, IPX, etc) do,
&gt; what??? Have I got this dynamic straight?
&gt; And if so, does this have any resemblance to your family?
&gt; And finally, is the rest of the series about the Newlyweds
&gt; starting off, or are their some other of the underlying themes
&gt; you've hit on that are going to be explored?

       There is such a thing as too much analysis....

                                                                  jms
