      There are bloopers, but we save those to show at conventions. 
There are some illegal copies floating around, but they're always poor
quality and we discourage people from buying them.

      The 2nd CD is great, I agree.  I think the first couple of
tracks are my favorite, particularly the extended season 1 theme at the
top.  I'll sometimes just let that one replay several times on its
own....
