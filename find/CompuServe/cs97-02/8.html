<H2>Season 5 Cancelled?</H2>

<pre>{original post had no questions}

      It's really little to do with popularity or ratings...it's the
reality of PTEN no longer existing, and contracts being tied up in a
corporate tangle, and them trying to decide if they want the headache
of doing all this again. We still don't know anything for certain,
though, so all we can do is wait.

                                                                  jms
