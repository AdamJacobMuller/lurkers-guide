<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Had you always intended to try to get the same actor to play the
&gt; Inquisitor and Lorien, or was it serendipity?

       Yeah, well, there's only so much you can do on TV and expect
stations to still broadcast it.

       We always knew only Wayne could do Lorien; no question, no one
else auditioned.

                                                                  jms
