<pre> Darran Williams &lt;100563.322@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I note that you say the virus has an incubation period of 5 years
&gt; so is this an indication that the series is intended to run for 5
&gt; years like B5.? On a side note will TNT be exclusively showing the
&gt; two Babylon 5 movies or do they intend to make a deal with other
&gt; TV companies around the world so that the likes of us in the UK
&gt; will be able to see them ?

       I imagine that the TNT movies will be made available
internationally, as that's how they'll make money off them.

                                                                  jms
