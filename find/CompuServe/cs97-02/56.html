<pre> Randall A. Schanze &lt;74724.762@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Having grown up on Irwin Allen SF, and having noticed hommages to
&gt; various other SF shows on B5 in the past (Most noteably the
&gt; Prisoner), I was wondering if this was intentional, entirely my
&gt; imagination, or perhaps just a case of form follows function?

       It's your imagination.  And form follows function.

                                                                  jms
