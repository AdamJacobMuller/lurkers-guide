<h3>Date: 10 Feb 1997 22:32:46 -0700</h3>
<pre> Scott Baker &lt;76072.1744@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; 1) Now that the first ones are gone, what happened to the Eye at
&gt; Z'ha'dum? 2) What's to prevent someone from going to the Vorlon
&gt; homeworld, and if they did, what would they find? 3) How
&gt; widespread is the knowledge of the victory? Does the Earth
&gt; government know what happened? And what about the people of Earth,
&gt; do they know? 4) NOW WHAT!?!

      Oddly enough, every one of those questions is addressed in
upcoming episodes, some as early as next week...so I'll let the show
speak for itself.

                                                                  jms
