<pre> Rebecca Eschliman &lt;76072.2345@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Can what Garibaldi says be counted as illusion or truth, these
&gt; days?

      Thanks...your reaction is about on a par with most folks...that
this ep is one that'll be discussed a lot, but not rewatched a lot,
because it's just really hard to watch, knowing what's coming.  It
really does tend to upset people.

                                                                  jms
