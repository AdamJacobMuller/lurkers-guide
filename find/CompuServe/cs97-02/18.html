<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; How would you respond to that?

      When characters die, they stay dead.  The one and only sorta
exception to this is Sheridan, and only for a) reasons that make sense,
b) reasons that are essential to a mythic structure, and c) really are
just a postponement; he's been reanimated and can last another 20
years, but that's the max.

                                                                  jms
