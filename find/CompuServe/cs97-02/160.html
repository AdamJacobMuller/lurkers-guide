"FWIW, that was your most courageous episode yet, IMHO."

      I appreciate the sentiment, so don't take this as lack of
gratitude on my part; I'm happy you perceive it that way.

      But courageous?  No.

      Courageous as an apellation belongs to the South American
writers who insist on telling the truth about their governments, who
risk death on a daily basis for doing so...and to other writers doing
similar work in other countries.

      Yeah, it was kind of a shot to the midsection for some groups,
with a certain element of biting the hand that feeds you, but the truth
is, ain't nobody gonna come to my door in the middle of the night with
death squads, take me away, and torture me.  If you want to hear about
real courage, join PEN International, or Amnesty International.  They
can always use the help.

                                                                  jms
