<pre> Jonathan Kass &lt;74130.443@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; But I'm curious, shouldn't he have been looking for Sinclair?

       No, Valen was a done deal, as far as the Vorlons were
concerned; they knew that that happened/would happen.  It was Sheridan
and Delenn who had to go through this...and in Delenn's case, more for
her benefit, in some ways.

                                                                  jms
