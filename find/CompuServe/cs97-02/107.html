      The other books...in broad strokes, I accept they happened, but
in the details, and how they're treated, and some incidentals...they
haven't hit all the right cylinders.  This time, with this batch, I got
more directly involved and I think they're definitely improved...though
the Cavelos novel had the least need for input, since she *really* knew
the show.

                                                                  jms
