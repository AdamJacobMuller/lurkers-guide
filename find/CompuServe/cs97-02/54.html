<pre> John Bovenmyer &lt;73567.1341@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; What did the latter call Delenn?
&gt; Is this important?
&gt; Was the rock that bumped the White Star and thus Lorien, letting
&gt; the Vorlons and Shadows know they were being 'tapped,' part of
&gt; the plan or just fate that worked out ok? Could Londo asking Vir
&gt; to kill him to save Centauri Prime one of his chances for
&gt; redemption and a successful chance?! What was the 6th?
&gt; Now that all 6 have left, and presumably won't appear again,
&gt; could you tell us the names of those races (assuming you've given
&gt; them any) and which ships belong to each race? Is Ironheart
&gt; already "beyond the rim?"

      I don't think the shadows speaking through Lyta referred to
Delenn by name; they said only, "And you they have left for us."

      The jostling from the asteroid was an accident, though the
others would've figured out what was going on soon enough.

      Thanks again.

                                                                  jms
