<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; My one, quick, curious question is, was the "big band" style
&gt; music used in the beginning something written specifically for
&gt; this episode? Or was it something else?

      Yeah, Chris wrote the music for us, in Big Band style.

                                                                  jms
