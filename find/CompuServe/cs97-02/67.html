      Thanks.  So far the general reaction has been, "But...but...what
NOW?" which is *exactly* the reaction I was hoping for.

      Everybody keeps commenting, "This is the sort of episode you
have at the end, not 6 eps into your season."  Yep.

      We're funny that way....

                                                                  jms
