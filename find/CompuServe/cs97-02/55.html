<pre> Derek Linden &lt;73322.2517@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Intriguing...now I'm really curious...what would have been his
&gt; (and the universe's) fate had Sheridan not gone to Z'ha'dum?

       That's one of those great questions to which the universe would
rather we not know the answer....

                                                                  jms
