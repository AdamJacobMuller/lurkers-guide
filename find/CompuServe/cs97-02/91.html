<H2>407: Afflatus?</H2>
<h3>Date: 10 Feb 1997 22:32:44 -0700</h3>
<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;75063.3305@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Question: Was there more to that scene that had to be cut for
&gt; time? Or am I just seeing things?
&gt; I take it that if there was, the dialogue wasn't terribly
&gt; important to the story, but do you happen to recall what was
&gt; said?

      You got it right...there was more in that scene, but we were
about 4 minutes over on that episode, and I was chasing about another
minute at that stage in the editing...and it went.  Weren't nothin'
terribly important, just this part that explained the ethical structure
of the universe and the true meaning of life, but heck, everybody knows
THAT one....

                                                                  jms
