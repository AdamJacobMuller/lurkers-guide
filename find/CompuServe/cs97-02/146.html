<H2>&gt;&gt;A Couple of Questions&lt;</H2>
<h3>Date: 22 Feb 1997 17:12:31 -0700</h3>
<pre> Toni Muller &lt;75223.1575@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; How many folks on Earth even know about the Shadow/Vorlon threat,
&gt; the assembled fleet, its success and the repercussions? Is this so
&gt; and, if so, when will we begin getting a clearer idea of what
&gt; that agenda might include?

      For now, just the one...no, not everyone back home even knows
there *was* a war.  Which our characters will find rather annoying....

                                                                  jms
