<pre> Chris Croughton (UK) &lt;100014.3217@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; My system has been losing messages, could you please repost the
&gt; info on the new CD?

       A mistake is a mistake, where's the mileage in saying it didn't
happen? In what parallel universe did it not happen?

       You can find info on the sountrack at www.sonicimages.com.

                                                                  jms
