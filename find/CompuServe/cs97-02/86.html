<pre> Rick Sharon &lt;76416.2213@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; What can I say that hasn't been already said?
&gt; Susan's comeback also echoed my uneasy feeling of "did it REALLY
&gt; just happen?" but, from you?
&gt; The decadence of dealing with "subjective humor", the paraded
&gt; G'kar telling the -other- Narn to "be strong", Ericson's suicide
&gt; mission, "what had G'Kar sacrified?" were those Narn's blind???
&gt; desperate?
&gt; Where will you take us from here?

      Thanks...and there are definitely more transitions to come....
