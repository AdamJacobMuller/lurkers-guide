<pre> Claire Nollet &lt;71232.2556@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; just how many hearts does the average Centauri have?
&gt; Also, I liked Cartagia's comment about humor "being subjective"
&gt; -- but isn't a mime a terrible thing to "waste"?

      Re: heart/hearts...I figured that the two collectively are a
whole from an emotional or spiritual perspective.  We say "a pair of
pants" even though it's just the one, as a related example.

                                                                  jms
