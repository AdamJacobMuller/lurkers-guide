<pre> Rebecca Eschliman &lt;76072.2345@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; As if there weren't enough stuff (acting, story, CGI) to
&gt; anticipate...(And it takes place on Epsilon 3?!!

      RE: actors and producers...it's a mixed bag.  Some producers
prefer to have as little as possible to do with the cast.  And
relations can be *very* strained, which leads to a lack of appreciation
of the cast.  On B5, the cast and I hang out, we go to dinner, do
conventions together, and I learn more about what they can do.  It
creates an atmosphere where you want to reward them and show what they
can do.
