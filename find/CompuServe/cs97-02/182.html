<pre> Carl Cantarella &lt;105030.3700@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; When Garibaldi spoke to Zach about his hiring him, were you
&gt; harkening back at all to when you hired Jeff for the role when
&gt; you wrote that particular scene?

       Jeff has certainly had his share of rough breaks, and we were
very happy to give him a home here on B5.

                                                                  jms
