<pre> Alan Mulvie &lt;100566.1444@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I was wondering if anything here relates to Stephen Hawking the
&gt; Cosmologist? Any comments, did Hawkings theory provide any ideas
&gt; etc???

       It's a good corrolary, yeah...that wasn't the intent going in,
but it ain't bad.

                                                                  jms
