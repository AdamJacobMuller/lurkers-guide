<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Was he referring to Lyta's contact with the "eye" above Z'hadum?
&gt; Was the "eye" a part of the Shadow's consiousness?
&gt; If not, will we ever find out what it was?
&gt; Although I have some reservations about both the Shadows and
&gt; Vorlons suddenly reverting into whiney, frightened 3-year olds
&gt; (You're not going to leave us all alone are you?

      You may not find out who built the Great Machine in the series,
but that will be one of the features of one of the planned TNT movies. 
And there will be more on the Valen/Sinclair transformation as well.

                                                                  jms
