<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;75063.3305@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; How's the production coming along?
&gt; What script are you up to in writing and which are they currently
&gt; filming? And, most importantly, how are *you* doing thesedays?

      Production's coming along spiffily.  We're currently working
with our guest star Efram Zimbalist Jr., who is going to be in 2
episodes.

      I'm getting along as well as can be expected under the
circumstances, and a few thousand pressures....

                                                                  jms
