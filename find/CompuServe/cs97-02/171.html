<H2>&gt;&gt;The Truth in IofT&lt;&lt;</H2>
<h3>Date: 24 Feb 1997 22:32:35 -0700</h3>
<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Is there no wear and tear on space suits and space ships?
&gt; Don't people and equipment bump into things in space and scratch
&gt; letters and bend things that aren't worth repairing? Is this
&gt; intentional? What does the print say on the top?
&gt; Any of these available on the market yet?
&gt; Is not Sheridan bothered a little bit by the fact that the
&gt; reporter may be right? Who really is telling the truth just a
&gt; little, Delenn or ISN?

      The Hubble looks pretty new and gleaming, until you get right up
close to it.  You don't allow wear in a space suit because it'll kill
you.  And the stuff at B5 is at *most* 4 years old, and only outside
when needed.

                                                                  jms
