<pre> Jean S McKnight &lt;105513.130@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; The field looked so real, inviting and wide open-- how'd you do
&gt; that? And is that B5 baseball hat he's wearing the one he had
&gt; Ivanova pick up in the now-defunct B5 gift shop "for his sister"?

      The whole set was a virtual set, except for a few feet of
dressing. All done in computer.

      The Agamemnon cap is something we may be offering soon via the
fan club.

                                                                  jms
