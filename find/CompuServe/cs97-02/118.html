&gt; So......is I-Con considered the next big con??

      Megacon in Florida would be the next biggie.  I'll be at that
one in Orlando March 15th and 16th.

      BTW, here's one of those little things that make you go
"hmmmmm...."

      That Starlog has an anti-B5 bias has always been evident, and
has covered us only reluctantly covered us.  There is a convention
listing page in the current issue.  It mentions the Gallifrey
Convention happening this weekend here in LA, lists the guests...but
omits my name.  So you figure, "Okay, it's an oversight."

      Then there's a listing for MegaCon in Orlando.  Now, understand
that MegaCon *advertises* in Starlog.  Three pages earlier, there's a
huge half page ad for MegaCon with my name in huge letters as the
primary guest.  But in the convention listing for MegaCon, all the
others are listed *except* me.

      One you figure could be an oversight...two, in the very same
magazine that has a huge ad for one of the conventions, starts to look
like a deliberate snub.

      Or, more succinctly, "Hmmmm....."
