       Nope, the events of WWE *cemented* the events that are to come.
What we saw in that flash-forward will now happen precisely because of
what has been done.  That future will take place.

       As for the story being over...not by a long sight.  Frankly,
some of what's coming in the latter part of this season is more intense
than anything we've done previously.  We really focus in on the
characters and the after-shocks of the war, in ways usually ignored.

       After all, we all know how nice and calm and civilized Europe
was after the War To End All Wars came to an end...we hardly heard a
peep from that part of the world thereafter....

                                                                  jms
