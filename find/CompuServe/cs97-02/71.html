"BTW, it is VERY enheartening that you speak out for the actors--good
show!"

      I think you *have* to.  The reality is that these individuals
were the core of the ST phenomenon.  It wasn't the EFX, good as they
were...it was the characters, and the capacity of viewers to care about
those characters, as portrayed and given life by these actors.  They
deserve recognition for creating something that has endured for 25
years, and to be rudely treated by the studio seems to me vastly
inappropriate.  (Did you know that until just recently, when the bulk
of the original ST actors took action against the studio, they had
individually received as little as $16,000 total as their share of the
25 year multi-billion dollar ST franchise?)

                                                                  jms
