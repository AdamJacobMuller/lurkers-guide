<pre> Jonathan Kass &lt;74130.443@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; 4) Promos - did you see the airing?
&gt; but such are the vaguaries of TV executives, right?

      Certainly I would never have made a big deal about the Ericsson
thing, because then it *does* set up certain expectations.  I didn't
hear about the promo until you did.

      There actually *was* a Lorien scene in that episode, but it got
slid a bit when we ran out of time in that ep.

                                                                  jms
