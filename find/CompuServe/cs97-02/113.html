<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; BTW, does the Regent have a name now?

       Actually, though the tougher Delenn is in flashbacks in 2
weeks, the foreground/contemporary story has her very tough, and very
smart. Basically, the next mini-arc sequence focuses a LOT on
Delenn...she has many facets, and while part of that is the
relationship, there's steel there as well, and we're going to explore
that.  As she at one point comments to Sheridan, "I appreciate that you
have come to care for what I have become... but never forget who I am,
or what I can do."

       After this arc of hers, nobody's ever going to make that
mistake.

                                                                  jms
