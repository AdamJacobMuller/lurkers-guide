      I just recently got DVD, and I have to say I'm very impressed. 
I'd thought that it would be a marginal difference...but it's actually
a quite substantial difference.  The resolution on-screen is amazing. 
When I'm watching a laserdisk, I'm still aware of this being a film of
the thing; here, it's just the thing...like watching a glossy photo
that moves.  It has more features, better quality, killer audio, more
flexibility, and costs less than LDs.  I'm sold.

                                                                  jms
