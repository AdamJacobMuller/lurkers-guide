<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Jeff Sigh Corps - Pat Tallman Division Great Maker huh?

"Sounds just like I figured it was.... her agent(s) screwed her by not
passing the offer along to Claudia.  &lt;sigh&gt;"

      Nope again.  I was there, in Blackpool, with her and the other
cast members, and I sat across from her in the hotel pub at midnight
and told her that unless we got a yes or no by the next day, after all
that had gone in during the preceding days, the offer put out to her by
WB would be withdrawn.

      She had all the information.

                                                                  jms
