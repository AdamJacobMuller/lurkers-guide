<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; HOW did they do so much damage?

       They targeted visually, it was close enough to do so.

       A hit with full guns of a major destroyer and accompanying
ships will kill damn near any single ship that does not have some kind
of defensive screen going (fighers or counter-lasers or missiles or the
like).

       The fightes wer launched in main while on approach.

       Franklin and Marcus *were* strapped in, which if you look more
closely you can see.

                                                               jms
