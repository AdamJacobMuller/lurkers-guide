<H2>DS9 = Babylon5 So what?</H2>

       Here's the "so what" part of it....

       If we allow for the moment, just the moment and no more, that
perhaps it did happen as I and others think it might have
happened...that Paramount influenced the development of DS9 to co-opt
B5....

       Imagine that you have just spent five years building a custom
car. And before you can even take it out of the garage, someone nabs
it.  And every day thereafter, they drive it up and down your street,
and everyone talks about what a great car it is, and how the other car
you still have is okay, and should't we be happy that the neighborhood
has *both* cars to look at?

       And if you commented on it, and someone told you, "so what?" I
wonder what your reaction would be.

                                                                  jms
