<pre>{original post had no questions}

       There will be two calendars coming out shortly for 1998, one
from Slowdazzle, the other from Antioch...and if you forced me to say
which was better, I'd say it was the Antioch calendar, which from a
design point of view is just absolutely spectacular, probably one of
the best pieces of licensing done yet in the pubishing area.

                                                                  jms
