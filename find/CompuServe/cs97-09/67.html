      Yeah, Pat and Bill are, I think, our only cast members who had
any real convention experience prior to B5, which is why I've taken
pains to try and help them understand the whole fan scene...which is
where the "nobody gets cut off the autograph line" notion came from,
for instance.  By helping them understand the venue, they're more
comfortable with it, and thus spend time not just hiding in their rooms
as is often the case with other shows, but instead go down to the bar,
the lounge, the room parties, and hang out with the fans.  (The tales
of Richard Biggs dancing on tables at Marcon, Bill Mumy at the parties
in the UK, others...they go on and on.)
