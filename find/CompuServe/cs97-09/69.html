"Either (a) it's right or (b) it's wrong to make such
accusations....you can't have it both ways. &lt;shrug&gt;"

      Incorrect.  It's right if it's true, and wrong if it's not.  The
statement itself is neither wrong nor right.

                                                                  jms
