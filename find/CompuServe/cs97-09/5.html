      Actually, Carl is correct.  If you're going to be realistic, a
captain in this position would be in her late 30s or early 40s, which
definitely puts Kristen out of the running.  I don't want to do a
Wesley and stick somebody way too young into an unrealistically high
position.

                                                                  jms
