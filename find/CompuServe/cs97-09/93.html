<pre> O. C. Alexander &lt;72623.3472@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Which brand and model is this, may I ask?

      I believe I got the Toshiba, baseline model, on the theory that
they'll upgrade soon, and went for a mimimum investment for the moment.

                                                                  jms
