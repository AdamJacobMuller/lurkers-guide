&gt; So you think you can run a BIG fan convention well enough to
&gt; satisfy gusets and attendees on purely voluntary labour?

"So you think you can run a BIG fan convention well enough to satisfy
gusets and attendees on purely voluntary labour?"

      Happens all the time.  About a month or two ago, I was at
Westercon in Seattle, about 3,000 people showed up...and it was one of
the most efficiently run conventions I'd ever attended...all on
voluntary work by those involved (who were comp'd into the convention).

                                                                  jms
