<pre> T.P. Chai &lt;104674.3064@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Was that the proposed process to be used on Delenn's voice?
&gt; And also did Mira's contralto voice give her an edge to be cast
&gt; for Delenn?

       No, the process on the Minbari voice wasn't the same as the one
we were going to use on Delenn...and Mira's voice was secondary to her
overall performance in casting her.

                                                                  jms
