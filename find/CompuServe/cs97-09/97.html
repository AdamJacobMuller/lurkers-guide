<pre> Mark Derrick &lt;72317.3662@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is it true that the serialized comics in the back will soon
&gt; feature new stories? If so, I wonder if they will be published in
&gt; the US?

      The new B5 comic to be serialized in the B5 UK magazine will be
gathered in a graphic novel and published in the US by DC in January.

                                                                  jms
