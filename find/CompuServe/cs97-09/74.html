<H2>Original "Final Four"???</H2>

<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Do you know if they are planning to broadcast the "original"
&gt; final four episodes that were done before Season 5 was renewed? Do
&gt; they have a special deal or are they just confused?

      No, they'll be showing "Deconstruction" as the last S4
episode...the rest is just silliness.

                                                                  jms
