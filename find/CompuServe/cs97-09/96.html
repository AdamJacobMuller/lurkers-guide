<pre>{original post had no questions}

      She was definitely not booted.

      There was absolutely no reason for ANYone to boot her.  No one
has yet provided one plausible reason why anyone at this side would
want her gone.  I certainly didn't want the character to go away, WB
didn't want the character to go away...she left when we couldn't give
her what she wanted.

                                                                  jms
