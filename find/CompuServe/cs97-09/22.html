<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; They mentioned something that I did not know; that B5 is one of
&gt; the very few (or perhaps only?

       The original ST won two years running, and just before that, TZ
won three years running.  In the 30 years or so since the original ST,
no other show has gotten 2 in a row, correct.

                                                                  jms
