<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; If the studio is holding back the writing on Voyager, why aren't
&gt; they doing the same for DS9?

      I think Paramount is now more concerned with Voyager than DS9
because DS9 is a syndicated show whereas Voyager is the linchpin of
their network. The more visible you are, the more they want to..."help"
you.

                                                                  jms
