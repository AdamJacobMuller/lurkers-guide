<pre> SysOp Dupa T Parrot &lt;70040.104@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; That was one of yours, wasn't it?

      Yeah, "Dream Me a Life" was one of my TZs and as it happens one
of the TZs I'm most proud of, followed by "The Mind of Simon Foster,"
"Our Selena is Dying" and "Rendezvous in a Dark Place."  Eddie Albert
did a terrific job in "Dream."

                                                                  jms
