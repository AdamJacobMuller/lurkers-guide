<pre> Phyllis Schmulenson &lt;72447.224@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is captain lochley supposed to be the captain of one of the earth
&gt; force ships that defect? Who is Diana?
&gt; What about her death?

      No, Lochley's ship did not defect.

      And the Diana of whom others are speaking is Princess Di.

                                                                  jms
