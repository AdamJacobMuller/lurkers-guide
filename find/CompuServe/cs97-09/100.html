"Yeah, I've been waiting for the 'you're just a trekkie with nothing
better to do than bash B-5' or 'Oh, look!  Another drive-by flamer'
comments. But as you said, Martin did outline his points quite nicely!"

      So in other words, you object to the sort of person who
uncritically goes after someone for giving a negative opinion.

      Okay, that's fair.

      I would also point out, however, that in all the time I have
seen your posts here, it seems like the only time you come out of the
woodwork is to uncritically support someone who says somethilng
negative about the show. Doesn't matter if they say it's too fast, or
too slow...you're right up there the instant it's posted cheering it
on.  Not the positive reactions, ONLY the negative ones, insofar as I
have ever seen, and on every possible issue.

      I would say that the one uncritical kneejerk response is just as
wrongheaded as the latter...wouldn't you?

                                                                  jms
