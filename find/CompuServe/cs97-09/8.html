      I wouldn't cast someone who was less than ideal for the role. 
If you don't find the right person, you just keep going until you *do*.
We had a goodly amount of time on this one, and we saw a LOT of very
talented people. But she rose right to the top.  We put her in
secondary auditions with our other top contenders, and she blew *them*
out.  Then we put her in a scene with Jerry Doyle, in one of their
nose-to-nose, toe-to-toe confrontational scenes, and I told her to pull
out all the stops and try to bury her...and Jerry can be a very strong
presence when he wants to be.  She held her ground and gave back as
good as she got, maybe more.  And at the end, even Jerry said, "It's
her."

                                                                  jms
