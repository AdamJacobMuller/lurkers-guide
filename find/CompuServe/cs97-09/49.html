       That's correct...but it's a matter of a space station, with a
female in command, that is a trading outpost, with a religious leader
in the midst of it, next to a gateway, with a shapeshifter in its
pilot, with a name followed by a number...well, one could go on...it's
the specifics, not the generality, that is of interest.

       BTW, you apparently announced over on AOL with some enjoyment
that B5's fifth year had been canceled and was not going to happen.  In
future you might refrain from prognostication until properly qualified
by the gypsy of your choice.

                                                                  jms
