<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; She claims there was no offer for 18 episodes made to her --
&gt; maybe her agent didn't pass such an offer along? Jeff Sigh Corps -
&gt; Pat Tallman Division Great Maker huh?

       "She claims there was no offer for 18 episodes made to her."

       That's correct, and not correct.  What was relayed to her was
that if she wanted to be in just 18, and wanted to be paid for just
those 18, then that was fine...her people insisted that she be paid for
the rest of the episodes, constituting a per-episode pay increase,
which couldn't be done without violating the contracts of all the other
cast.

                                                                  jms
