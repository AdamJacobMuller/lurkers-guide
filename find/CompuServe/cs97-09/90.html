<pre> Rebecca Eschliman &lt;76072.2345@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; What has me curious is will each trilogy be penned by the same
&gt; author (which seems the natural thing to me) or will each book of
&gt; the trilogies have a different author (which seems strange, but
&gt; something I can imagine due to the increasing oddities of the
&gt; publishing business)?

      Each three-book arc will be written by one author, yes.

                                                                  jms
