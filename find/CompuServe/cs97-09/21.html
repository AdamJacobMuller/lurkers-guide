       No, you don't seem to understand the point.  Of course the
actors you cast have technique.  Where did you get this from? 
Especially the "some actors are just being themselves" part in this
context.  Wortham wasn't "just being himself" as Cartagia, nobody is. 
Neither is Andreas, and neither is Scoggins.  She didn't just walk into
the room and do herself, she created a character.  Lochley is nothing
like Scoggins.  Scoggins made a number of actor's choices, and when she
entered the room, she *was* Lochley.

       I don't mean to be rude, but it's hard to have this
conversation when it's clear you don't really know what's involved in
casting or acting or creating a character, and are using your
misunderstandings to justify ragging on Scoggins.  Andreas was
neck-and-neck with Morgan Shepard for the role of 
G'Kar...fundamentally, Andreas' approach was more in line with what I 
envisioned.  Tracy was the same way.  We cast the person who was right
for the role.  If the person's not right, we don't cast them.  The only
time it hasn't worked out as well as I'd've liked was when we cast Mary
Kay Adams, who was very strong in the auditions, and then made an
actor's choice to play the character very quiet, to not push against
Andreas...but you fade into the woodwork if you do that.  So it's not a
question of technique there, but of choice.  She was right in the
audition, but her choice later wasn't what we'd initially hoped for.

       And Tracy is *great* as Lochley in all the dailies.

       But basically, this is a stupid conversation.  You're obviously
hoping to get me to be defensive about her, and there's no need.  Every
sesaon the same thing happens, a cast member comes in or goes out, or
there is another change, and some people cry that the sky is
falling...and in the end, the choices have been right.  There is
nothing to defend.  Either the work succeeds, or it does not.  And that
will be borne out in the episode, not the talking.  I had to deal with
this with Bruce, Stephen, even Claudia, I would point out, from the
Takashima fans out there, which a lot of folks have conveniently
forgotten.  Lots of folks online were saying that Tamlyn was a strong
female character and that in casting Claudia we were just putting in a 
"babe," and pilloried me for it, and at the end of the day, when they
actually *saw* what she was doing, they were fine with it.

       So I'm kinda tired of playing that game.

       See what she does first, *then* we'll talk.

                                                                  jms
