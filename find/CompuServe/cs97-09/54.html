<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Can the producers of shows run fan events as well?
&gt; What if fans' reactions do not agree with the official line?
&gt; How many hats can you comfortably wear?

"Can the producers of shows run fan events as well?"

      No, nor was that the intent of my message.  We've talked about
doing just one, a one-off convention, here in LA at some point in the
future, but that's all, we can't and wouldn't want to get beyond that. 
No, my only point was that maybe something can be done to make the
profit conventions hew more closely to the rules by which the fan run
conventions operate, and perhaps we can try to influence that in
future.

                                                                  jms
