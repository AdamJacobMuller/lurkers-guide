<H2>Claudia's Leaving?</H2>
<h3>Date: 01 Sep 1997 19:47:27 -0700</h3>
<pre> Francis Rogers &lt;73742.1613@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Why would she do this?
&gt; Was it a desire for more money, to have her part beefed up, or
&gt; what? In view of the fact her character seems to be pretty
&gt; popular, could you give her a second chance or something, or is
&gt; it too late?

      She asked for things that were not in our power to give, and
when they were not received, she passed on the offer to return.

                                                                  jms
