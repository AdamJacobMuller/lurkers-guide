      Thanks...yeah, wrote two other books, OtherSyde (novel) and an
anthology, Tales from the New Twilight Zone, as well as short stories
appearing in Pulphouse, Amazing Stories, Midnight Grafitti, Shadows 6,
and a brand new (and rather long) story coming out next Spring in the
Death Out West anthology edited by Martin Harry Greenberg
(mystery/crime stories), called "We Killed Them in the Ratings."

                                                                  jms
