<pre> colin heaps &lt;100622.3610@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; At that time Claudia *seemed* to be in for S5, now that's not the
&gt; case, do you intend to shift the ability as another part of a
&gt; different character, or will it be one of life's little
&gt; mysteries? (You know - like why is there always 1 spoon left in
&gt; the bowl after washing up? On another issue, (sorry if you've been
&gt; over this before), but I just read in SFX that you won't be
&gt; attending anymore Wolf conventions due to "queueing?" and
&gt; "treatment of the fans" ?
&gt;  - Could I ask if that was for sure, or could we all persuade you
&gt; that you are worth lining up for? Anyways, in parting, can I just
&gt; say, season 4 is "doing my head in" as we say hereabouts, you
&gt; don't believe in static characterization do you?
&gt;  - Anyone asked about yur reaction to Diana's death yet?

      The stuff Ivanova would've done this season will be shifted in
part to another, but not Lochley.

      Re: Wolf...no, I won't be doing any further Wolfs due to my
ongoing concerns with the way they are being run, the way that the fans
are being treated, the unreasonable lines, and other genuine concerns I
have with Brian and the organization.  They promised that all illegal
good would be kept out; the dealer's room was *chockablock* with
unlicensed, pirated stuff, forcing me to have to go and police the
thing, which was not what I was there for, and put me in some difficult
situations...they promised that the lines would be dealt with fairly,
and they were not...I had yelled before at Brian for showing 4th season
material, as yet unaired in the UK, at conventions, he said he would
not do so, and yet the music videos were full of this footage (he says
he only promised not to show full episodes, so that isn't the same
thing, which is nonsense...he says that he got the videos from others
so they're not his fault, which is also nonsense)...I have asked him,
repeatedly, to follow through on his offer to let us inspect the
records of the charitable donations made by the convention, because I
have heard that a goodly amount the money never reached its proper
destination, and I would like to know the facts one way or the other,
but thus far he has consistently refused to do so, even after having
said at first that they were available for inspection...I've heard
enough times that he has been muscling other conventions by telling 
people he has a lock on our cast that I'm concerned... and so on.

      I have an obligation to associate myself and this program only
where I feel things are being done properly.  My concern here is that
they are not, and thus I cannot and will not involve myself or
Babylonian Productions with any further Wolf conventions.  My cast are
free agents, and can do what they wish, but there will be no further
cooperation with Babylonian Productions until these areas are addressed
and fixed.

                                                                  jms
