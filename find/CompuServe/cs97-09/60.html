       I think what I learned was, never ever do this again....

       It's hard to pin it all down, really.  Since no one's ever
really done this sort of thing before, you have to make up the rules as
you go. Every day is a new decision, a different fork in the road...I'm
not even sure how I'd pin it down to any one thing in specific.  It's
like saying "what did you learn different going from an automatic
transmission to a manual?"  It's just different ways of thinking and
working.

       And it was the EAS Furies.

                                                                  jms
