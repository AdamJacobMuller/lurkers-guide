<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; BTW, is this the first consecutive winning award or did TOS or
&gt; TNG do this before? What episode will you propose when you go for
&gt; the threepeat? G Give MEmphis Tennessee What the heck is a
&gt; Tennessee Oiler? Does anybody really care?

      Classic Trek won twice in a row, the original TZ did three in a
row.
