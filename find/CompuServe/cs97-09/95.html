<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Im not saying Paul Winfield's guest starring specifically, but
&gt; any dialogue??? Have you gotten similar feedback from fans?
&gt; Was that creature everyone killed a shadow?
&gt; Plan on comming to Ny, NJ, or PA anytime soon?

      I'm still leaving General Franklin's line open for the moment;
the creature with Amis was a shadow servant...and I'll be in Baltimore
and Taunton, Mass next spring for conventions.

                                                                  jms
