<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Shane just asked about you collecting your own short stories?
&gt; In the same vein, would you consider (after year 5) authorizing
&gt; an anthology of fan fiction about B5?

       I'm open to all sorts of fiction prospects down the road, once
the show is out of production.

                                                                  jms
