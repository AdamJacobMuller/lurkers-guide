<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; That begs the question does B5 need a professionally run
&gt; convention? What do we fans get if we don't get Wolf 359 type
&gt; conventions?

       I've always preferred the fan-run convention format to the
other sort, so there has to be a way to maintain that structure, and
I'm looking into that.

                                                                  jms
