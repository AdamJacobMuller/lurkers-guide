      That's Harlan...that's how he is most of the time.  And yeah, I
got in my stuff earlier.  When Harlan gets a full head of steam going,
best to just get out of the way and watch with wonder.  I think it's a
couple of months old, though I don't know if this is a first or second
run of it.

                                                                  jms
