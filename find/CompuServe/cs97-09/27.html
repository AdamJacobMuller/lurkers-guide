<pre> Rob Carr &lt;73200.2754@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; YOU wrote for The Real Ghostbusters?

      Wrote for it, heck, I story edited the first network season and
the syndicated season *simultaneously*, for a total of 78 episodes, and
wrote 22 episodes (5 of which came after that first season) including
the Halloween ABC special for which I wrote a couple of songs.  It was
a great deal of fun to work on, until they messed up Janine, which is
why I left.  Later, when they realized that had been an error, they
asked me to write some more with her pretty much as she had been, and
then to fix the continuity error in an episode called "Janine, You've
Changed."

      Some of the ones I wrote were Xmas Marks the Spot, Mr. Sandman
Dream Me a Dream, Citizen Ghost, Ragnarok and Roll, The Thing in Mrs.
Faversham's Attic, No One Comes to Lupusville, Chicken He Clucked,
Doctor Doctor, and a bunch of others.

      TRGBs is now playing on syndication again, in the Amazing
Adventures package...uncut, as far as I can tell.  (I think it airs
Sundays at 2:30 here in LA.)  It was a hoot, and it's one of the things
I'm still very proud of.

                                                                  jms
