"Actors usually charge a much higher appearance fee than a fan
convention can shell out."

      Actually, a lot of our cast do fan run conventions...Jerry and
Richard were at Shoreleave and a cruise, Rick has been to Marcon, a
slew of other local fan-run conventions as well as others overseas,
Stephen was at Rebelcon a few weeks ago, Pat does an assortment of fan
conventions, so this ain't as true as might be assumed.

                                                                  jms
