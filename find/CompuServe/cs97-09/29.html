<pre> Rob Carr &lt;73200.2754@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; YOU wrote for The Real Ghostbusters?

      BTW, when they did the second season without me, they introduced
the odious "Junior Ghostbusters," and at one point asked me if I'd be
willing to write a script using them.

      "Only if I get to drive a truck over them," I replied.

      They never asked me again.

                                                                  jms
