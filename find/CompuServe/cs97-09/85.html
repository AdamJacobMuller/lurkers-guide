<H2>jms in Tulsa</H2>
<h3>Date: 17 Sep 1997 22:55:56 -0700</h3>
<pre>      For those in the vicinity of Tulsa, Oklahoma, I'll be at DefCon
this weekend, to be held in the vicinity of the Adams Mark Hotel.  Will
be bringing clips from the final batch of episodes, plus clips from the
two movies, a bit of Tracy Scoggins stuff from S5, bloopers and other
fun stuff. The main presentation is 1:00 Saturday, with another on
Sunday.

                                                                  jms
