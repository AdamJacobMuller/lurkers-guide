<pre> Darran Williams &lt;101656.2143@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Was that just idle gossip as I've seen nothing on it since ?

       The release of SD on DVD is still not confirmed, though we're
still in discussions and it looks good.  There was talk about a
widescreen version of WWE on tape but I don't know what the current
status of that is.

                                                                  jms
