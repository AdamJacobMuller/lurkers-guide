<pre> Roseann M. Caputo &lt;103510.1542@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I know that Jeri Taylor is a friend of yours, but who the heck
&gt; has control and is making these aweful decisions?

       I'd seen the 5-minute South Park pilot, and last week's episode
was the first one I'd watched through.

       Sick and twisted and funny....

                                                                  jms
