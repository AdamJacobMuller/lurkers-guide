"I completely disagree. B5's Mindwar was HARDLY an original concept
and was, in fact, ripping off other material. Akira for instance."

      In 43 years, I have never seen more than 5 seconds of Akira, and
generally have no idea what the story is about.  Anime is one of those
things that does nothing for me.

      To rip off is to steal intentionally.  I suggest you use that
term sparingly in future.

                                                                  jms
