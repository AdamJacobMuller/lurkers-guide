<pre> T.P. Chai &lt;104674.3064@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; the physical presence of the actor tells you she's the one?
&gt; or do you mean as soon as the actor opens her mouth to speak as
&gt; herself, or as soon as she goes into the audition routine as the
&gt; character?

       The funny thing is, you usually know within, oh, 25-30 seconds
of the actor actually starting the audition if this is the wrong person
or not. And in that same amount of time, someone else can either nail
it completely, or end up on the short-list for callbacks.  It's totally
subjective and intuitive.

                                                                  jms
