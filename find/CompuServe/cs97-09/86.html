<pre> Roseann M. Caputo &lt;103510.1542@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Do you know will it just be SD on the DVD or will it be packaged
&gt; with a second episode? Do you know what background info, if any,
&gt; will be included? Are you involved at all in the decision making
&gt; process on this?

       I don't know...all our discussions to date have just concerned
SD, so we'll see.

                                                                  jms
