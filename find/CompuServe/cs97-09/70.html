      That's an interesting question.  When I sat down to write In the
Beginning, my feeling was that I should look at the long term.  Would
the hole in Sinclair's mind be the same mystery it was in season one,
or would it be kind of known thereafter?  If so, then do you want to
play with the mystery, or set up what actually happened?  I figured,
okay, let's go for the latter...let's let the audience know (which will
mostly know by now anyway), and set up the background, with the
characters not knowing the first season. I took basic greek tragedy as
my model, with ItB functioning more or less as a Greek chorus that sets
things up.

      If you want to play it as a strict mystery, then no, probably
don't go near ItB...but frankly, if I were going to start someone off
on B5, I'd definitely want to start with ItB, which sort of skims in
and out of the overall storyline in a beautiful fashion.

                                                                  jms
