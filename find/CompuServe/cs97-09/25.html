<pre> Phyllis Schmulenson &lt;72447.224@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I'm missing something- who is Tracy Scoggins and what role is she
&gt; cast in?

      Scoggins is on board for season 5 as Captain Elizabeth Lochley,
who is going to full the void in the command structure left by Ivanova.

                                                                  jms
