      Del Rey has signed a deal with WB to do the B5 novels
henceforth, and as part of that will be doing a series of three, 3-book
arcs (for a total of 9 in addition to stand-alone B5 novels) which will
feature an overall story that I'll assign to the writers involved.  The
goal is to keep them within canon, but allow the writers some degree of
freedom, and to fill in some of the corners in the B5 universe.  For
instance, one 3-book arc may be the story of the fall of Centauri
Prime; another might be the history of the Psi Corps and what made
Bester what he is; and the third set strongly on the B5 station itself.

      These stories are still being determined, natch, so this ain't
final.
