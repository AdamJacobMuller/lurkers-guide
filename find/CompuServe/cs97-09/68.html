"And as for B5 being the number one Sci-Fi show, does it really come
any close to the worldwide popularity of The X Files?"

      Oddly enough, the show tends to do much better overseas than it
does here.  Well, not oddly, actually, since overseas it tends to end
up on actual networks, which give it a regular time period, whereas
here you have to have a hunting dog and a Ouija board to find the
darned thing.  The videotapes are invariably in the top-10
sell-throughs overseas, in fan polls it comes out ahead of X-Files
(having just won the SFX Magazine poll for best SF series of all time),
and the ratings are comparable.  If anything, X-Files has gotten a bit
soft lately, while B5 has been improving.  Most of the B5 licensing to 
date has been overseas, with a huge line of books in the UK, along
with a monthly magazine.

      That's expected to change when the show hits TNT, with a regular
schedule, starting in January.

                                                                  jms
