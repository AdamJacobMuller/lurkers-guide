       No, frankly, I don't think Paramount cares about the Hugo, or
even knows what it represents.  I don't believe (though I could be
wrong) that they even *had* anyone at the Hugos in case they'd won. 
No, Paramount's concern is that the franchise shows are losing ratings,
and they're doing everything they can to bolster them and make them
more exciting.

                                                                  jms
