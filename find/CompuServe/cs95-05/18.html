<pre>Yeah, I kinda wanted the current arc in the comic to come out around this
time; it's good for showing a flashback that ties into several parts of
the story at once.  (One biggie is yet to come, at the end of the comic arc.)

I'm currently writing a new 4-issue arc, which is designed to give all the
backstory of a new character that will (if we're renewed) be introduced in
the third season, all of it canon, and which weaves in and out of many of the
major events we've seen in year two.  In theory, the first issue of that would
hit the stands about the same time the first episode of the series is aired
(assuming the above).
