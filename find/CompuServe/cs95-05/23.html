<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: May 19, 1995 1:13:19 AM</h3>
<pre>Bits of this and that....

1) Claudia Christian, Bill Mumy and I will all be appearing (in separate
appearances, I believe) at the Creation Mega-Show in Ahaheim, CA at the
Anaheim Convention Center the weekend of May 27-28.  I don't know which day(s)
they'll be appearing, but I'll be there that Sunday.  For more info, call
Creation at 818-409-0960.  Should be a big convention.

(Side-note: Creation has produced some *very* nifty B5 jackets, some in
denim, others in suede/leather, with the station embroidered on the back.)

2) To parents of small children who watch B5...next week's episode,
"Confessions and Lamentations," is a very strong, intense, uncompromising
episode.  You *may* want to watch it first, in order to better decide if it
should be seen by them, and what you may want to discuss later.

3) To sum up various threads here...yes, Warner Bros. has decided that the
last four episodes of this season will be aired in October, in order to
get a running start on a (hopeful) third season in November, though there has
as yet not been any confirmation about a third season.

4) For our Irish viewers, Peter Jursasik will be blipping in for a one-day
appearance in Dublin this weekend.  Contact Gerard Keating here on CIS for
more info.

5) A number of cast .avi files have been uploaded here; they can be
re-uploaded to other systems, and are a great deal of fun.  You may want
to check them out.
