<pre>No, Sakai was never slated to vanish into shadow-lands.  This isn't a
case of transplanting storylines.  If things were going to be done in
exactly the same way with either character (Sinclair/Sheridan) then there would
be no NEED to bring in another character.  Logic.

Re: the two speeches by G'Kar and Delenn...yes, they were constructed
specifically to echo one another, because the walkers at Sigma 957 are one
of the older races that flit through but don't really pay any attention to us
anymore.
