<pre>Re: disliking the idea of god...I don't, and don't feel its correct to
dislike ANY idea.  Ideas are simply that: words and thoughts.  The idea
that one sex or race is better than any other is harmless; the PRACTICE of
treating one race or sex better than any other, and acting upon that idea, IS
odious and wrong and must be stopped.

We should never be afraid of ideas.  Good can only be properly understood
in the context of evil, as balance points on our intellectual fulcrum.
I've always wondered why the notion "Lead us not into temptation" was something
to be praised.  Rather, I think it should be "lead us INTO temptation," because
it is only when a belief, or an idea, or a faith is most fully tested, and one
can REFUSE temptation, rather than just avoiding it, that growth takes place.
