<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: March 22, 1995 2:45:03 AM</h3>
<pre>     I'm constantly amazed at the quality of work coming out of Matt Wagner.
His MAGE continues to be one of the best graphic novels out there.  And
while I'm quite enamored of his GRENDEL series in all theirf various
incarnations (literally), it started as a MAGE backup, and I'd like to see him
finish the promised sequel one of these days.

     For what it's worth, in case anybody's interested, the books I'm finding
of constant interest include just about anything from Grant Morrison, Neil
Gaiman's SANDMAN, the FLASH has gotten really kind of interesting, all the
ALIENS/PREDATOR stuff from Dark Horse tends to be just briliant, Steven Grant's
X, the current SPIDERMAN clone-identity stories, Stan Sakai's USAGI YOJIMBO,
plus BOOKS OF MAGIC, SUPERMAN, the new STARMAN has potential, and it looks like
DC may finally have gotten LEGION OF SUPERHEROES onto a track worthy of its
origins.

(Yeah, if you haven't figured it, I've got about a $40 per week habit at
my local comics store.)

(*vainly hoping to one day see more MIRACLEMAN titles, maybe this time
from Alan Moore.)
