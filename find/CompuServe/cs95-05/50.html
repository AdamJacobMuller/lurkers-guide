<pre>"No disease in human history is 100% fatal."

Not correct.  The Black Death was fatal to everyone infected by it.  It
was not, as Drafa, 100% contagious, but it *was* about 90% contagious.
The Black Death wiped out *three-quarters of the entire European population*.

Roll that around for a while.  Three-quarters.

The only thing that saved areas of Europe was that there wasn't as much
travel then as today between countries; it was reserved for those with
enough money to afford it, which were very few.  There were also fewer means of
entry; a river and a bridge closed to refugees was often enough to keep people
out.  There is now MUCH freer travel.  Had there been freer travel in the 14th
century, it's entirely possible that the entire European population might have
been completely eradicated, with those few who might've been immune dying from
associated diseases, hunger and other problems caused by the presence of the
disease.

One person I spoke with at the CDC (Center for Disease Control) said that,
hypothetically speaking, the sudden eruption of a disease like this is
possible.  How likely depends on various circumstances.  There are, for
instance, regions in the Amazon and South America where certain kinds of plant
and animal life can only be found; and those specific lifeforms can transfer
diseases to humans...diseases that literally melt the flesh off your body, or
in another case, cause worm-like infestations to burst through the skin
covering the entire body.  (Let me tell you, researching this was just a whole
lotta laughs.) They are *highly* contagious.  The only thing that has (so far)
prevented a massive outbreak is the fact that by the time you can generally get
OUT of these remote areas...you're dead.

A particularly aggressive disease could perform very much like what is
described in the episode.
