<pre>The comics vary in applicability.  I don't see why the events in the
current arc wouldn't apply.

BTW, I'm writing a new 4-issue arc, which introduces a character who will
be seen in the (one hopes) third season.  So this will provide all the
canon background on the character, and have it out before the airing itself.
