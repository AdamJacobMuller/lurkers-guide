<pre>You're making a mistake in semantics.  First, if someone is trying to
introduce legislation based on this anti-female POV, then that is an
action based upon the idea, and as I've said, that is where you now draw up
sides and try to convince the majority that this idea is wrong.

More importantly, the issue at hand is the right simply to *express* or
hold unpopular beliefs.  A free society allows all kinds of ideas.  A wise
society chooses with care which ideas it implements.  At its best, we must be
both free and wise.
