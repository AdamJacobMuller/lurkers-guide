<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: May 20, 1995 4:45:08 PM</h3>
<pre>The grapevine's info is wrong.  We have not yet been formally or
officially renewed.

In retrospect, the only problem with having given nods of respect to other
works of SF is that now it seems that's the main thing people look for,
seeing it even when it's not there.  The show was never intended to be a
pastiche, but that's how some choose to, incorrectly, perceive it.  "Oh, this
is a tribute to the Spock/Kirk pon farr fight."  NO it's not.  Part of the
problem may be in the frame of reference; those with backgrounds in literature
see parallels to Homer or MacBeth; those who primarily have an SF background
see it all as riffs on Blake's 7 or somesuch.  It's enough to make me consider
yanking OUT all nods and references forever down the road, to avoid people
saying, "Oh, he's just doing X" when the simple fact is that I never SAW X in
most cases, wasn't doing X, have no DESIRE to do X, and I thunk up this scene
myself while sweating blood at 3 a.m.  It's kind of hard to go through that
much pain, creating a scene, and then have someone say, "Oh, he based that
scene on the cabbage sequence in "Mighty Mouse.""

     So I'm giving some measure of thought to this whole issue.
