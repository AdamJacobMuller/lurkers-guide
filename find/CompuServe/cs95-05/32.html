<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: May 20, 1995 4:45:05 PM</h3>
<pre>No, Wiseguy did not have any influence on writing my show.  The story arc
was written 7 years ago, long preceding that show.

Nor was Ivanova's ankle-break a tribute to anything, since it was written
in to accommodate a real accident in which Claudia broke her foot.
