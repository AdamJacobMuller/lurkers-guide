<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: May 28, 1995 11:30:06 PM</h3>
<pre>I don't think his behavior was boorish at all.  After a very long day, in
which (he stated) he hadn't eaten a thing, he sits down in a cross legged
position for (if you track the time in the story) 3-5 *hours*, alternately
eating and meditating in a small, quiet room...who *wouldn't* fall asleep?

As for the "golden boy" thing...I'm forever amazed at how many folks just
don't learn the lesson.  People saw Vir come in, decided he was a comic
character, a fop, nothing more, and complained about it...until he started to
show his other colors over time, and to *grow into the role*.  And people said,
"Oh, yeah, he's kinda interesting after all, isn't he?"  YES, HE IS, YOU
LUMMOX, GIVE THE CHARACTER AND ME SOME CREDIT HERE.  (Not speaking to you,
Anne, this is just what goes 'round in my head when the gerbil's not spinning
the wheel.)

What's the number one rule of B5?  Nobody's what they appear.  What's the
number two rule?  Joe is interested in *process*.  You don't start out a
character at point A and keep that character there forever; the show is about
change and process.  Look at Luke Skywalker.  Was he in "Jedi" the same person
he was in "Star Wars?"  No.  He went through a growth cycle and maturity
cycle.  Look at Frodo at the start of Lord of the Rings, and at the end.  The
classic hero's journey starts with someone who is breathtakingly unprepared for
what's coming, and has to develop and grow.

Sheridan comes to B5 with a bit of a silver spoon in his mouth and a smile
on his face.  And he's going to get the crap kicked out of him.  And he's
going to grow, and mature, and become someone of importance, and great
strength, at great cost.

So sometimes I lose patience -- probably incorrectly -- with people who
look at Sheridan and, despite seeing every other character on this show go
through major changes -- assume that what they're seeing now is all there will
ever be.  On another level, it's kinda wrong for me to feel this way, since
though I know where the characters are going, nobody else does, and it's unfair
to expect people to react to something that hasn't been shown yet.

What can I say?  I'm a writer.  I'm a little nuts sometimes.
