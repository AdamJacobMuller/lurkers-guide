<pre>Yes, "Knives" was originally intended to be shown prior to "Shadow," but
the heavy CGI requirements of the former caused it to be shown second. It
doesn't affect the story much, mainly it was there to re-introduce the audience
to certain ideas and concepts (like the Icarus) before dealing with them
big-time in "Shadow."
