<pre>&gt;&gt;Along these lines, is there any chance we might see -- on the nets or in a
magaizine -- a &gt;&gt;story on the creation of a random episode, beginning from when
the script is written to air &gt;&gt;date (including pre-production, filming, and
post-production)?

If any magazine ever wants to write that article, we're up for it, but so
far, no one's approached us on it.
