<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: May 22, 1995 12:52:26 AM</h3>
<pre>On one level, this does indicate that we really *are* crazy over here at
B5.  Here we developed this race for nearly two years.  Developed their
culture.  Mentioned them prominently just last episode.  Had them speak before
the full Council (in "Long Dark").  Spent substantial amounts of money making
them the biggest single alien group we've got (some of the group shots had
40-50 or more Marcabs, all in full prosthetics and full costume)...and now,
never to be seen again.

It couldn't be a race we've never seen before, not if it was to have the
impact I wanted.  It had to be a group that's been with us from the
start.

In Council scenes for the balance of the season, the Marcab seat remains
empty.
