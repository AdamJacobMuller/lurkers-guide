<pre>It's not possible to be on the edge of shooting the season, and not know.
Contractually, we have to notify the cast, for instance, by no later than
June 10th or so, or be in breach, and that won't happen.  There's just a lot of
details right now still being worked out between the stations and Warner Bros.
We keep expecting final word literally day by day.  Should be soon.
