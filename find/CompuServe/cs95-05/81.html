<pre>     No, what usually happens is that you sense a calling one 
way or another early on; you are assigned to (for lack of a 
better term) a teacher, who guides you and sees if your 
calling is sincere (the teacher is from the caste you feel called 
toward), and if the calling is true, you can enter that caste.
