<pre>I have zippo control over this.  It's strictly a PTEN decision, based
primarily on sweeps periods and the like.  The reason they don't want to
run new eps after May is that in June-August you have the lowest HUTs
(Households Using Television) figures of the whole year; folks are out,
enjoying the weather, going places, on vacation.  September puts you right up
against the major network releases, and syndicated shows get *killed*. Year
three would, one hope, debut in November...so that leaves October, after the
new shows have settled down, and it's a non-sweeps period.
