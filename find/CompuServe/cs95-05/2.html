<H2> B5 T-Shirt/Caps Info             </H2>
<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: March 04, 1995 2:40:24 AM</h3>
<pre>     A while back, in discussing merchandise, I mentioned that All-U was doing
some *great* shirts, but that they were mainly supplying direct to
distributers.  Because of demand, they've begun selling now directly, on
individual orders.  How long this will last is anyone's guess, but they're
doing it now, and I figured I'd give everybody a head's up.

     They're doing short AND LONG SLEEVE t-shirts and caps.  The caps are with
the B5 symbol embroidered.  The shirts are black, with full-color artwork
from photographs and CGI images supplied directly by Foundation. The shirs are
of the following kind: cast with station; station with B5 logo and the words
"the last best hope;" station, logo and the nearby planet; and station, logo
with a starfury flying past in foreground.

     They're nicely done, without the usual thickness associated with color
inking on black shirts.  These are authorized and approved.  When we saw
how nifty these shirts were, we ordered boxes of them for the stage, and these
are the same kind worn around the B5 set by cast and crew.  (They practically
flew out the door upon arriving, by the crew in particular.) They're really
nifty.

     Apparently there are CIS rules about giving out the prices of the shirts,
so I won't, but I will say they're very reasonably priced.  Their phone
number is 1-800-424-2558, ext. 105.  They're a very enthusiastic bunch of guys
who love the show, and want to do it right.
