<pre>No, this has always been part of the ongoing negotiations ever since the
big PTEN meeting.  As for the rest...as this has dragged on longer and
longer, I've started to get a little nervous (but only a little), because the
longer it goes on, the more that internal politics will start to manifest
themselves, and that always worries me.  But there isn't much of anything that
can be done from outside, so it's just back to wait and see.
