<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: May 17, 1995 8:45:24 PM</h3>
<pre>There is just about zero chance of B5 ever ending up on the WB network, as
those two (WBN and PTEN) are *very* competitive with one another, and
neither division would allow it.  (Unlike other companies, WB is set up as a
series of competing small empires who are not required to cooperate, in the
theory that this will make for stronger individual divisions.  Not always
true.)
