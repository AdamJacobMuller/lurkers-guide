<pre>     The last 4 episodes of this season are being held by 
PTEN until October, in theory to  lead into the year three 
(not yet approved) debut in November.  I think I finally 
sussed out why this is being done; I heard the other day 
that Voyager is doing the same thing.  So that means PTEN 
is counter programming it.
