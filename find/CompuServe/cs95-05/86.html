<pre>     I dunno...I've seen much the same thing.  I think, on some 
level, it comes from the top. Seems like every time a politician 
appears on the horizon, propped up as the latest Knight In Shining 
Armor, sooner or later we discover that the armor is empty and the 
knight is off somewhere boffing the innkeeper's underage daughter.  
Maybe we have too many politicians and not enough leaders.
 
     Such cynicism can also be self-reflective, though.  We're 
still reeling from the hangover of the Me-Generation.  Self-
sacrifice, altruism, these have become "stooge" values, snickered 
at, derided..."You WHAT?  You turned in the wallet you found?  
What're you, brain-dead?"
 
     Someone made an interesting observation lately, that the WW II 
generation raised their families with the notion that their kids were 
the most important things in the world.  The kids grew up and, well, 
kinda believed this, and became the center of the world, with *their* 
kids all too often afterthoughts or part of a process to make *their* 
life richer, where it is convenient for them.  I don't think that's a 
wide-reaching generality, but I think it's true in enough cases that 
it merits consideration.
 
     Nobody trusts anybody anymore.  We all assume the other guy's 
working an angle somewhere.  And here, I think, the perception is 
inaccurate, because there *are* plenty of people out there working for 
the greater good of the commonweal; it's just that when the evening 
news rolls around, it's the crooks and the conmen and the latest 
Capital Hill scandal that gets the attention.  I dunno...it's a 
conundrum, to be sure.
