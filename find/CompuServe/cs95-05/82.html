<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: May 29, 1995 4:43:20 PM</h3>
<pre>     I disagree strenuously with the notion that the universe as 
presented in the current ST series is a "brighter vision of the future."  
It looks to me like humans have left behind everything that makes us 
humans.  We've been bioengineered to within an inch of our lives. 
 There seems to be no interest at all in what happens back home on Earth
.politics, changes in culture, fashion, new music.  One's job description 
seems to be the end-all and be-all of his or her life.  "Recreation" is 
always the sedate card playing type, the nightmare dinner party of the 
1950s, or living out a fantasy world in the holodeck because there's 
nothing much in the real world.
     Passions and spikes in our humanity have all been hammered down and 
eliminated.  Remember "Invasion of the Body Snatchers?"  That, to me, 
is the Star Trek future...set aside your passions, do all for the 
collective good, it's a better world that way.  Maybe you 
call that perfection; me, I call it a nightmare.
