<H2> M TV &amp; R and B5?                 </H2>
<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: March 04, 1995 12:52:20 AM</h3>
<pre>     Thanks for sticking with it all this time.  It's kind of funny; Mark
Hamill talks about how he went to several conventions just prior to the
release of STAR WARS, and practically couldn't get arrested.  He'd sit there at
a table, all alone, and nobody would even come by.  Six months later....

     At those first few B5 panels, back when the show was still only in the
"here's what I'm going to do" stage, before we'd aired a frame of film,
the usual reaction was "yeah, sure," or hostility, or disbelief, or just no
reaction at all.  But at many of the cons, there was this core group of people
who believed in the project from the first word...who lent their belief and
their support to something they hadn't even seen, in the hope that maybe this
time their dilligence and faith would be rewarded.  And to those who make
Babylon 5, those are the special ones, and we are very mindful of them.
Stepping out on faith takes a certain degree of courage, and that's not
something to be taken lightly.  So thanks for being one of them.

     Re: your question...at this juncture, I think I'd have to choose "The
Coming of Shadows" as the one episode I'd use to represent the series.
That one episode came out so close to perfect, so close to what I saw in my
head when I wrote it, that the difference is no difference at all.  It has all
the elements I'd feature in a B5 discussion...the CGI, the characterization,
the complexity, the politics, the language, the performances.

     There are, by the way, some really extraordinary episodes coming up. The
first one in the next cycle of new episodes, "And Now for a Word," will, I
think, be very popular, and to my knowledge does something that has never been
done in SF television before; "There All the Honor Lies" is a fun episode with
some nice characterization and solid humor; "In the Shadow of Z'ha'dum" is an
episode that is as emotionally raw as "Chrysalis" with some major revelations
that force Sheridan to make the most important decision of his life;
"Confessions and Lamentations" I'd put right next to "Believers" in intensity,
a terrific Franklin episode; "The Long, Twilight Struggle" is probably the
biggest episode of the entire two years to date, story and EFX and character
wise, and will have a profound effect on the series that I'd compare to a cross
between "Signs and Portents" and "Chrysalis"...and "Divided Loyalties" will
produce a stunning revelation about one of our major characters.

     The latter half of this season is all about tightening the screws until
you hit the screaming point.  I've got to send this show over the edge,
because THAT'S where the really interesting stuff begins to happen.

     I have a big sign on my office wall.  It's a quote from Franz Kafka. (And
by big I mean 2' x 3'.)  "The point of no return; that is the point that
must be reached."  The latter half of this season will send us tumbling end
over end beyond the point of no return...and taking many of our characters with
us.
