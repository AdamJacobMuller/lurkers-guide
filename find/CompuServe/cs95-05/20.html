<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: May 17, 1995 8:46:05 PM</h3>
<pre>Thanks.  The 4-issue arc I'm writing is fairly large in scope; it goes to
an area near the Rim, to Minbar, Earth, Narn, Centauri Prime, Babylon 5,
and involves the majority of our characters, plus we learn a lot more about the
Rangers.

(Why do I seem genetically incapable of just writing a simple little
story...?)
