<H2> RoB5: Bashing...                 </H2>
<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: May 29, 1995 2:20:15 AM</h3>
<pre>"...the fact remains that more people continue to enjoy Trek than Babylon
5."

Don't you think it's just the *teensiest* bit unfair to compare a show
with a TWENTY SEVEN YEAR HISTORY to something that's only been on the air
less than two seasons?  If B5 and ST came on the air at the same time, then you
could make this comparison fairly.  ST has, over nearly three decades, become
part of the culture; B5 doesn't have that advantage.

On the whole issue of so-called "Trek bashing," part of my brain explodes
every time I see this discussion dredged up from whatever place it rests
in between sessions.  For 27 years, many ST fans held up that show as being the
Ultimate in TV SF.  "Well, X is okay, but it's not as good as STAR TREK!"
"Show Y really sucks next to Star Trek."  And so on.

So now somebody says, "Well, Star Trek is okay, but it's not as good as
BABYLON 5" and suddenly I hear a lot of whining and whinging and "Tell the
bad mans to stop making fun of us!  That's not fair!"  Seems to me it's only
not fair because somebody other than ST fans is saying it.  (And please don't
tell me the former stuff didn't happen; I've been on the nets since 1984 and at
cons/in fandom since forever, and I've seen it.)

Most of the ST fans, I should point out, are quite accepting of B5; what I
see most often is those who did the most bashing of every other show
falling entirely to pieces because now they're at the other end of it, as
though their show should be sacrosanct.  To whom I simply say...tough.  Deal
with it, pink boy, it's *your* turn in the barrel, and if you don't like it,
then maybe you shouldn't have been doing it yourself all these years.

This leads to comments like those from (either Berman or) Pillar in a
recent magazine interview, in which he stated that yes, there are lots of
other SF shows out there, but because his show has the Star Trek name on it, he
really doesn't have to keep up with or have any sense of competition with any
other show, since that name gives them an automatic advantage.  That speaks to
the heart of why many ST fans are now having a problem with that show, whose
motto seems to be, "We're Star Trek, we don't HAVE to try harder."
(Reminiscent of the SNL routine, "We're the phone company.  We don't care.  We
don't have to.")  It's sheer complacency.

When some ST fans berate or criticize other shows, they feel they do so
from a perspective of quality, and thus they're automatically right; if
another fan of another show does it to them, well, by golly, that's not
informed criticism, it CAN'T be, because ST is the True One Light, it must be
BASHING!  Screw that.  Any show that can't take a little criticism isn't worth
squat in the first place.

And don't even *try* the notion that B5 gets by without criticism.  I see
*plenty* of it...a certain percentage comes from misunderstanding, a
certain percentage just making trouble...and a great deal of it is quite
correct.  But it's *there*, believe me, I go through it every day of the week.
If maybe people do it a bit *less* than ST, could it possibly, just maybe, be
because we generally do fewer stupid things and make fewer dumb mistakes?  No,
couldn't be that...it must be blind loyalty, check your cerebral cortex at the
door and don't question.

Nope.  We try harder.  Work harder.  Because we don't have the luxury of a
27 year franchise behind us.  The only thing we have to offer is a passion
for quality and hard work.  We can't rely on the sure knowledge that viewers
will come back to us every week because of our name.  We have to make every
single episode as close to a home run as we can, because we can't afford even
*one* foul ball.

"...more people continue to enjoy Trek than Babylon 5."  Yeah, and more
people eat at McDonald's than Chateau Marmont.  So what's your point? (And
no, I'm *not* saying that ST = McDonalds, I'm just trying to illustrate the
numerical fallacy in the argument you proffered.)  Numbers prove nothing in
terms of quality per se.  If it did then BAYWATCH would be the Grail to which
all TV should aspire.  I would remind you that more people originally watched
LOST IN SPACE than ST when it was on the air; that LiS lasted longer than ST
out of the gate, garnered more positive reviews than ST, and ST was generally
considered, in newspaper and magazine articles, to be just a "cheap attempt to
cash in on Lost in Space's popularity," and a vulgar adventure show without
substance.  That's how it was described.

Seems to me that ST fans should know their history, and understand when
they are doing to another what was done to them.  (And most do, btw.)

The *hardest* part, for me, is knowing how many ST fans ARE open minded,
and accepting, and living out what was, frankly, Gene's concept of IDIC,
infinite diversity in infinite combinations.  And it's the majority of them who
are nifty, bright, open people, as opposed to a very small minority of
whiners.  I was at a Creation Convention today, and time after time after time,
I had people come up to me to say that they like B5, in many cases more than
ST...and many of them said it with a glance over the shoulder, as though
nervous that somebody was going to come over and argue with them or berate them
about it.

There's nothing unpatriotic or disloyal about criticizing ST, any more so
than criticizing any other show.  In theory, that's how shows get better.
Assuming the people in charge are listening.

In sum...this isn't a screed or a Jeremiad against ST, or ST fans, or
anything of that nature.  It's just that I get tired of a very few people
who seem to apply the word "bashing" to the show they've been using to bash
other shows, and thus dismiss any merit to the critiques by redefining it in
terms more convenient for their own beliefs.  Here you've got this multi
billion dollar MONOLITH that is *STAR TREK*, 27 years of history, multiple
series, movies, zillions of merchandising items...and a few people fall apart
and get hysterical because somebody raises his hand and says, "Err, umm, I
kinda have a problem with something ST does."  Please.  At least we have the
sense to laugh when we see an elephant frightened by mouse, and this situation
is not terribly dissimilar.

(And, once again, the ST criticism tends to come from ST fans who also
watch B5; there is no such thing as a B5 fan who's never watched ST and
goes after it.  This ain't a B5 problem, it's an ST problem.)

The unfortunate part of all this is that ST fandom is generally nothing
less than terrific; they kept a show on the air, sustained a vision, and
have been ever faithful.  It's only a very vocal few who start vibrating into
another dimension when the show gets pinked once in a while.  The open attitude
that I've seen displayed by the vast majority of ST fans is to be commended,
and complimented.
