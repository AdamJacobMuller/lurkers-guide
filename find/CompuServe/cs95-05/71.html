<pre>What I've lately been led to understand is that PTEN wants to hold the
last 4 episodes, which I'd assumed would be in July, until *OCTOBER* in
order to use them to get a running jump on the (not-yet-oficially-approved)
third season.

Take your reaction, multiply it by a factor of 100, and you will have
mine.
