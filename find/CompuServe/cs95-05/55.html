<pre>Unfortunately, no.  Baseline problem: both WB and the stations want B5
back, but there are some outstanding, and rather substantive negotiations
still ongoing concerning financial issues and other stuff that doesn't involve
us directly, but affects our fate.  Those negotiations have not been completed,
and everything is still in abeyance.
