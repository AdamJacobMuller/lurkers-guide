<pre>Okay, let's say you identify a "bad idea," to use your phrase.

Let's say racism.  You, from your POV, define racism as a bad idea. Now
what do you do about it?  Try to eliminate the bad idea?  How?

Now, that's you.  That's fine.

But Bob over there, at the Four Square Baptist Church, he thinks that
feminism is a bad idea.  What should he do about that?

The problem is many-fold.  Who determines what a "bad idea" is?  Are you
willing to let another define that for you?  Or define it yourself for
everybody else?

What our system of government does is to guarantee freedom of speech and
ideas.  Even, and especially, the ideas we hate or disagree with.  It's
easy to protect the ideas we like and agree with.  It's the others that need
protection.  The day we stop defending those rights, is the day somebody else
decides that OUR ideas are "bad ideas."
