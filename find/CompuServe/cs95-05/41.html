<pre>We don't do the sound of engines droning all the time, but we do a fair
amount of audio mapping, very subtle stuff, most noticeable if you run it
through a good Dolby surround sound system.  If you're running it through a
straight TV set, you may lose a fair amount of it.

The UK ratings are published somewhere, but I don't have it at hand.
