<pre>What Colin misses, obviously, is that not *all* of the markabs are
"mindless religious fanatics," in that Dr. Lazarenn was not one, but that
was mainly because he had long been exposed to human/outsider ideas, which most
of his reclusive people are not.

Second, y'know, I get asked a lot, "Give us ALIEN aliens."  So I do. And
then I get gigged because they don't act like we'd expect humans to act.
Sometimes I just throw up my hands....
