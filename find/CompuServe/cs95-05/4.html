<pre>No, the Sinclair storyline would not have been introduced the same way as
the Sheridan story vis a vis the shadows.  That was kind of my problem as
I got into this; how to tie him to that part without straining credulity, given
everything ELSE he was into.

Science/exploration vessels are privately funded, and go into areas of
considerable hazard.  They arrive by piggy-backing on a larger, jump
capable ship, with an appointment X-number of days or weeks later with another
ship to go home.  While it's gone, it's on its own.  EA can't afford to send
out more ships into a situation like this, where they have no real idea what's
gone wrong, and it's a private venture, any more than the US can send out the
Coast Guard to investigate every single ship that disappears at sea halfway
across the globe.

Re: Voyager, I feel that the characters have great potential that has not
yet been really explored.
