"One of the magazines have said that Bill Mumy and Stephen Furst will
NOT appear in front of the camera for season five....Say it aint so
Joe..."

      Ain't so.  They're both in 503, and will appear thereafter as
well. Also in the main credits as usual.

                                                                  jms
