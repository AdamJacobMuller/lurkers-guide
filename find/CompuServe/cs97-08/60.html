<pre> Carl Cantarella &lt;105030.3700@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Wouldn't she be too young for the part anyway?

      You're quite correct, she's definitely too young to be
realistic. Which is why all the actors we're seeing are in their late
30s to early 40s range.

                                                                  jms
