<H2>The Gathering done?</H2>
<h3>Date: 22 Aug 1997 17:29:02 -0700</h3>
<pre> Kevin P. Kenney &lt;104102.352@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; But has it been rescored, as it has been re-edited, in
&gt; preparation of a late commissioning? If not, might it be?
&gt; BTW, is the price tag still around the previously mentioned
&gt; $150K?

       No, the re-editing has not been completed; the editors jumped
in and did some of it, based on my notes, in their spare time, because
they want to see it done, but the actual
sitting-with-the-editors-and-slogging-through-it that John and I do is
yet to be done, and that's where the main part of the work happens.

                                                                  jms
