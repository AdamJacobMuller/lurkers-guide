<pre> Tom Knudsen &lt;72347.1626@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; What about hosting an RPG using a website AND using the properly
&gt; licensed RPG The Babylon Project? Wouldn't that be seen as a
&gt; proper use of the game? Or, does the fact that it's on the Web
&gt; mean you're publishing a new story?

"What about hosting an RPG using a website AND using the properly

      My guess is that yes, that would be kosher...but then, I ain't a
lawyer and am basically pulling that answer out of my butt....

                                                                  jms
