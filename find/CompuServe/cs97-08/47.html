<H2>Claudia's replacement</H2>

<pre> Michael Beemer &lt;71551.1670@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; So, you've written the first 4-5 scripts, but don't have the role
&gt; cast? How much slack do you have to cast and begin shooting?
&gt; Or, can you write the character out of 501 if there's a delay in
&gt; casting?

      No, you almost always write the character long before you have
the actor; you just find the actor that fits the character, then slowly
the two begin to merge once the role is cast.  When Bruce came on
board, I think we already had the first 4-5 scripts in hand.

      In the case of Lochley, she isn't in 501 anyway, that's the 422
replacement...she's in 502, and we still have time on that one.

                                                                  jms
