<pre> Roseann M. Caputo &lt;103510.1542@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; When you do the marketing thing, will you be making any of the
&gt; scripts available, or is that one of those things that you
&gt; haven't really been able to give a lot of time/attention to?

       Selling B5 scripts is something I'd like to do, with the
difference that the writers involved -- David, Larry, Peter, everybody
 -- would get a percentage, just as with a book publication.  That's the
way it *should* be done.  These guys who sell scripts through stores
and mail order don't give a penny to the creators or writers whose work
they are selling.

                                                                  jms
