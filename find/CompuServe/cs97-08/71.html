<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; How the heck did he know that I was going to get water stains on
&gt; my first copy?

       Actually, the B5 cover has become an instant collector's item,
selling for anywhere from $20-50 in some places, and more overseas, so
those who bought multiple copies now have a good little investment on
their hands.

                                                                  jms
