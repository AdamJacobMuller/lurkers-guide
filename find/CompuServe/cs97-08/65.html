       Since the copyright rules are made by Congress, no, I'd imagine
not.

       "Whenever a copyright law is to be made or changed, the idiots
assemble."

       "One thing is impossible for god: to make sense of any
copyright rule in any country in the world"

                                       (both from Mark Twain)

                                                                  jms
