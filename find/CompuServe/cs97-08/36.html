<pre> Ron Chusid &lt;74756.3150@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Have you considered writing it once you are finished with the
&gt; series (assuming your time doesn't get monopolized by the next
&gt; show)?

"It would be interesting to read an outline of the original arc, and
the various changes which you have had to make along the way. I'm sure
there is quite enough inside information for a book. Have you
considered writing it once you are finished with the series (assuming
your time doesn't get monopolized by the next show)?"

      One heart attack at a time.

"You might consider a writing a more general book rather than one
directed towards aspiring scriptwriters. You'd have a lot more
competition, but a considerably bigger potential audience."

      See above.
