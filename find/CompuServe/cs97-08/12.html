<H2>Last Four of Season 4</H2>
<h3>Date: 04 Aug 1997 21:04:14 -0700</h3>
<pre> Michael Nelson &lt;70403.1270@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Do the PTEN stations have an obligation to show the remaining
&gt; episodes of Season 4? I have not called the station yet, but if
&gt; they (and other stations) have decided to not show any more
&gt; episodes, will the debut on TNT in January take care of this
&gt; problem? Would TNT begin with the last four episodes of Season 4
&gt; and then go immediately into Season 5?

      No, the final four contractually belong to the local stations;
they may not be showing it *now*, but should be showing it in October.

                                                                  jms
