      Oh...got it.  Yes, the places that are under discussion, like
scriptshop.com, which sell scripts without the permission of the
writer, who does control the physical script, are ripping the writers
off.  Yes, they are definitely in violation of the basic
agreement...but then, they aren't signatories, either.  They're just
crooks.

                                                                  jms
