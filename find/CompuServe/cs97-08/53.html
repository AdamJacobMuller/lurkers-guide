<H2>The future of Draal</H2>
<h3>Date: 18 Aug 1997 00:18:50 -0700</h3>
<pre> Jimmy K &lt;110435.632@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is the actor that plays him available for the show or has he
&gt; permanently left to do other things?

      The actor is on Broadway playing in Hello, Dolly, which makes
his appearance in Hello, Draaly improbable for the moment.

                                                                  jms
