<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; How did her first day go ???

       Her first day is today.  She's working out swimmingly. 
Everyone is finding her a real joy to work with.  She took home about
30 tapes of prior shows to watch over the weekend, has buried herself
in homework studying scripts and articles about the show, and has
basically impressed the hell out of the cast and crew.

       And no, I can't tell you yet.

                                                                  jms
