<H2>TLN - Minbari phrase</H2>
<h3>Date: 21 Aug 1997 11:39:30 -0700</h3>
<pre> Neville White &lt;100335.2721@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Could you tell me what the minbari phrase was that Ericsson used
&gt; at the end of the conversation, and again just before he died?

       The Minbari phrase was the standard way for Rangers to end a
conversation, with a salute to the Entil-zha, the head of the Rangers,
which is Delenn in this case.

       And thanks....

                                                                  jms
