      Actually, the concept for DS9 was not put forth to Paramount
until about 2 months after the announcement was made in the trades
about B5 going into production as a pilot.  The B5 material was in
Paramount's hands in 1989. Just trying to keep the timeline straight.

                                                                  jms
