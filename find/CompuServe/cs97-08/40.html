<pre> Jimmy K &lt;110435.632@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Have you decided what the new B5 novels from Dell will be about?
&gt; Will they be more canon, like Book #9 was?

      There's something very exciting in the works for the next batch
of B5 novels, but I can't or shouldn't say anything until the
announcements come at WorldCon.

                                                                  jms
