<pre> Carol Naylor &lt;100645.2613@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Ever since I realised that you'd been on-line long before B5 got
&gt; off the ground, I've wondered whether your on-line participation
&gt; as the show's producer was something you'd conciously decided to
&gt; do or whether it was something that, like Topsey, just 'growed'?

       No, it was just a natural extension of already being online. 
The only deliberate decision involved was, "Do I *change* my life and
what I do for pleasure just because I'm more well known now than
before?"  I'm still the same person, so the answer was no.

                                                                  jms
