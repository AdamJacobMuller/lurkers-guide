<pre> JOEL ARAUJO &lt;76016.122@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; It is not a against copyrights to post everything and anything
&gt; about the series on any given website but it is totally agaisnt
&gt; copyrights to host a sim? WHAT'S UP WITH THAT?

       Because posting material already existant about a show is one
thing (and WB requires that the proper copyright be appended to all
such web sites in any event).  A different situation is a sim, which
*uses* copyrighted characters and situations, creating a *game* which
is not licensed, which also results in *story material* that also
infringes on the copyright and could create further complications.

                                                                  jms
