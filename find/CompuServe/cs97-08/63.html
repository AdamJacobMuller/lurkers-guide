<pre> Jonathan Kass &lt;74130.443@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Could you shed some light on which way this really works?

       Nuts...I missed that when I went over the text.  I guess I got
so used to seeing him in relation to the Aggy that I just went past it.
No, the mining incident took place when he was first officer on the
Lexington, under Captain Sterns.

                                                                  jms
