      I'm keeping DC and David in my hip pocket for the moment; there
are an awful lot of writers who've wanted desperately to write for the
show in the last few years, who couldn't because I did two seasons
alone.  I have kind of a moral obligation to give those folks a shot,
and since there are only about 5 open assignments, I have to be very
selective.  If I can in good conscience give one to David or DC, I will
definitely consider doing so.  But the new guys deserve a shot.

                                                                  jms
