<pre> T.P. Chai &lt;104674.3064@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; JMS, when Emperor Turhan asked Kosh "How will it all end?"
&gt; Is that why the episode where the Vorlons left called "Into the
&gt; Fire" or was it just a coincidence?

      One of the reasons, yeah.

                                                                  jms
