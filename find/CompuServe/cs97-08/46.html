      Yes, Bruce is definitely a history buff, from the civil war
period up through WWII and beyond.  That's one thing he and John
Copeland share, a real interest in WWII history and the like.  Bruce,
being something of a cowboy in real life, also has a substantial
interest in, and familiarity with, the old west and native american
histories.  He also reads and enjoys SF.

                                                                  jms
