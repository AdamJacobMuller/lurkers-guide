      The only thing that is intense about this news is that it's
massively untrue.

      Jerry is *in* the fifth season...he just finished shooting his
stuff for 501, and has a major personal arc throughout the first part
of this season, another toward the end of the season, and is on board
for all 22 episodes.

      He didn't make it into the movies because of agent stuff, but
that's only the two movies, and we have every intention of having him
in the third one.

      This is one of the problems with the internet...someone mishears
something, posts it, and because it came from "an authoritative
source" in this case Peter, it gets picked up as real.  And then I have
to spend days correcting and "contradicting the cast, so who's telling
the truth?"  You misheard.  He's *in*.  Has been from day one.

                                                                  jms
