<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Guess who turned up in Cinescape magazine's letters column?
&gt; Is this guy for real?
&gt; Has he paid any attention to the actual practice of TeeVee?

       He's a bitter, mean-spirited person who feels he has to tear
down the show.  It's his obsession.  Trying to explain it rationally is
like trying to play golf without those tiny holes in the ground, you've
got no basis for the conversation to take place.

       As for his prediction...back when B5 was first getting going,
and I was at a convention in San Francisco that actually booed me when
I said that this show might eventually give Star Trek a run for its
money, one woman in the audience -- two Presidential elections ago --
yelled out, "Yeah, right, and Clinton will be President."

       'nuff said.

                                                                  jms
