<H2>B5, TNT, and Censorship</H2>
<h3>Date: 17 Aug 1997 16:07:03 -0700</h3>
<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Will TNT silence out words unacceptable to their bizarre
&gt; standards from the original episodes of B5 (pilot and seasons one
&gt; through four) and from the new fifth season and it's
&gt; "made-for-cable" movies?

      Dunno...nobody's said boo to us about this one yet.

                                                                  jms
