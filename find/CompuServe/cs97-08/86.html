<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; No, I mean, aren't all 5 going to be released in a collection?

       No, the Cult soundtrack is from a variety of TV series, using
only a piece of each, and not the original music from Chris in this
case.  It's another party just re-recording the music (and not as
well).

                                                                  jms
