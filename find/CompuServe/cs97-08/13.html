<pre> Rebecca Eschliman &lt;76072.2345@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; One thing that has me curious -- when another writer does a B5
&gt; ep, and you feel the need to ask for revisions, does it tend to
&gt; be because they don't have the characters' "voices" quite right,
&gt; or do they throw in elements that skew your arc? In other words,
&gt; is it character or plot that more frequently needs adjusting
&gt; before going to film?

      It's never any one thing...it always varies from writer to
writer.

                                                                  jms
