<H2>To Kill a Cow?</H2>

<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;75063.3305@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Since the machine obviously works on alien life, why wouldn't it
&gt; work on, say, cattle? Why couldn't some sort of animal raised for
&gt; food (such as cattle) be used on the "killing" end to save (or at
&gt; least help) a dying patient? I mean, the animal would be killed
&gt; anyway for its meat, so why not? And, BTW, how's Captain
&gt; Freakdaddy doing now that filming has started again?

       I think that one could argue that the life force of a sentient
creature is considerably different from that of a cow or dog...unless
one wanted one's loved one to start moo'ing....
