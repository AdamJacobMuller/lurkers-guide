<pre> Jonathan Kass &lt;74130.443@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; could you comment on what isn't?
&gt; I'm pretty sure I get what that means, can you comment on whether
&gt; that figures in to the remainder of the TV series?

      "Going beyond" was left deliberately vague...we may see
something of this in time.
