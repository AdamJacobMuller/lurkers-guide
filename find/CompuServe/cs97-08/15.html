<H2>Bureau 13 Question</H2>
<h3>Date: 06 Aug 1997 23:02:36 -0700</h3>
<pre> Michael Nelson &lt;70403.1270@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Do you have any plans for Bureau 13?
&gt; Has it been mentioned in any episodes after its introduction?

      No, Bureau 13 was subsumed into the larger organizations.  After
we did the episode, we learned of a rpg called bureau 13, and decided
not to use it again just to avoid confusion.

                                                                  jms
