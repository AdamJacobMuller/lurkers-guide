"Originally, the creators of B5 went to the ST folks with the concept.
They thought it would be easier to launch the B5 concept in the ST
Universe. However, after much talk, the Trek folks turned it down. 
Soon after, DS9 was launched."

      This has been repeated elsewhere and needs to be corrected.

      1) B5 was *never* at any time submitted to anyone at Star Trek.

      2) B5 was *never* considered by me, or anyone involved with B5,
or discussed with anyone, as taking place in the ST universe.  This
story could flatly and simply not take place within the confines of the
ST universe as set up and maintained.

      3) B5 was *never* turned down by the ST folks for reasons 1 and
2 above.

      4) B5 *was* submitted (treatment, artwork, series bible, pilot
screenplay) to Paramount Television, which did review the material for
some time before deciding to try other avenues.

      Just to clarify....

                                                                  jms
