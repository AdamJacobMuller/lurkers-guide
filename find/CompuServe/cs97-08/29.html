      I honestly don't know how important the web has been because
frankly, if you added up all the web-users out there, it wouldn't be a
blip on the ratings charts.  That said, our audience has definitely
increased over the last 4 years, one of the few syndicated shows that
has grown while nearly all the rest have fallen.  Xena has grown, and I
think one or two others, but that's it.

      It just takes any show a while to find its audience, or in this
case, for our audience to find *us*, given scheduling.  We've begun
doing that, and are nearly at critical mass.

                                                                  jms
