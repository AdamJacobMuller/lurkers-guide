      The problem over there isn't the material, it's the restraints
put *on* the material by Paramount.  Jeri Taylor is one of the best
writers and best show runners in town; give her room to flex her
muscles, and she can flatten any show around and blow the doors off SF
TV.  Unfortunately, due to the Paramount heavy-handedness and
restrictions on all their writers, you have a situation with a Ferrari
sitting in a garage and never allowed to go more than 20 miles around
the block.

                                                                  jms
