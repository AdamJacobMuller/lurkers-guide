"I went over to the site with the address you gave and got a file not
found on server error.  I ended up just using
www.tvguide.com/tv/circuits and then clicking on the Bruce B. story
from there.  I looked at the url at that point and saw
"www.tvguide.com/tv/circuits/0815a.htm".  The only difference I see is 
that small "a" after the 0815, where you had a capital.  I don't know
if that's what the problem was or not."

      Yeah, apparently that makes all the difference...so anyone
looking on, make the a lower case not upper case, or just go to the TV
Guide main menu.

"From what I've seen of Bruce B. on shows like PI and the like, he
must be one of the most unpretentious TV stars I've seen.  I wonder how
much this has to do with him working with James Arness."

      I don't know if it's specifically that, but yeah, Bruce does
have a kind of outspokenness and frankness and "ah, hell," attitude
that comes from his long association with westerns.  He's absolutely a
straight shooter.

"I can't imagine what B5 would have been like without Bruce.  Bruce
has brought a LOT to the show.  You, and the fans, really lucked out by
Bruce getting on board."

      Bruce has done a great job.  He loves the role, he *is* the
Captain, and around the stage he's the show's cheerleader, team
captain, and resident bright spirit.  Peter also does a lot of that, as
does Rick, but Bruce is just an amazing team player.

                                                                  jms
