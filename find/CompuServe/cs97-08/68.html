<pre> T.P. Chai &lt;104674.3064@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I assume the re-editing and re-scoring is complete and you have
&gt; delivered it to TNT?

      No, TNT still hasn't commissioned the re-edit and re-mix of the
pilot.

                                                                  jms
