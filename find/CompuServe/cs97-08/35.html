<pre> Roseann M. Caputo &lt;103510.1542@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Are these legal?
&gt; Are they being sold legally?
&gt; Would appreciate any info you might have and if you or one of the
&gt; cast is presented with one of these, would it get signed or would
&gt; I get a smack in the head?

       No, these scripts are *not* legitimate or legal.  I know they
say they buy from "script dealers," but that translates out to "people
who stole scripts from studios."  WB is aware of this one, and
preparing to go after them.  The actual ownership of the physical
*script* itself is shared and/or alternated by the studio and the
writer, and it *cannot* be sold without the permission of the writer.

                                                                  jms
