<pre> Stephen Burrow &lt;70640.40@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; What happened, and was it any big deal?
&gt; Have you ever been invited on PI?
&gt; Would you even be interested?

       Yes, the union came in on season 3, on a Wednesday, if I
recall, and by the end of the week it was resolved, and that was the
extent of it.

                                                                  jms
