"A three week turn-around time for mail order isn't too shabby but I'm
getting spoiled by online merchandise vendors. I'd like to see the B5FC
offer merchandise online using current technologies.:"

      Already in process; we just changed providers at thestation.com
in search of a really stable and safe charge system, and should have an
online credit charge system up and running very shortly.

                                                                  jms
