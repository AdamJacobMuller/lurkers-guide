<pre> Sam Waas &lt;73052.2644@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; area?
&gt; How did this guest appearance evolve?
&gt; I mean, you couldn't sit down at your computer to write the
&gt; episode and say to yourself "Let's see -- I need some external
&gt; thread to bind the episode together as a plotline B to supplement
&gt; the Day of Dead plotline A -- mmmm -- Why not have Penn &amp; Teller
&gt; guest star?" In other words, how could you write the characters of
&gt; Rebo &amp; Zooty into the script without prior communication from
&gt; P&amp;T? You modified the character to fit the guest stars, right?

      Neil wrote for R&amp;Z, and we looked around for casting...it
occured to someone -- may have been me, maybe casting, I don't remember
 -- that it might be better to use a real comedy team than create one. 
B5 called P&amp;T, and they said yes.

                                                                  jms
