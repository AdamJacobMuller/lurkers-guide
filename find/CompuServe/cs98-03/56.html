<pre> T.P.Chai &lt;104674.3064@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; JMS, do you personally interview all the actors who had speaking
&gt; roles?

      Yes, I'm there for 99% of all auditions; the final decision is
mine, Doug's, John's and the Director's (3 out of 4 is all we need). 
Only the really, really minor characters -- two words, one sentence,
that's all -- get past me.

                                                                  jms
