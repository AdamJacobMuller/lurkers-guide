      Neil kept the humor sort of off-base...operating on the
assumption that there are some things that become au courant or funny
because of context: Steve Martin's "excuuuuse me," for instance.  Now,
it ain't funny, it's just annoying...at the time, EVERYbody was saying
it and laughing.  R&amp;Z are similar cultural phenomena...their "with a
machine" catchphrase, for instance, which the crowd new and reacted to.
To us, and Lochely, it didn't mean anything. Lochley's reaction was
tailored to be EXACTLY the same as most women's (and some guy's)
reaction to the Three Stooges: either it's funny, or you can't figure
out why people are laughing.

                                                                  jms
