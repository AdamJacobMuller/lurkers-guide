      I didn't have any particular battle in mind, no, but I have a
passing familiarity with battle tactics, and wanted to create that
sense in a battle of pieces...you never really see the whole battle,
each soldier sees his or her part of it, and at the end, we call it the
battle of X.  That sense of out-of-control events.  It was something I
wanted very much to get right.

                                                                  jms
