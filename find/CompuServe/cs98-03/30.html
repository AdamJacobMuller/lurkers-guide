"Have you ever studied Gurdjieff or Sufism, or any of the Eastern
religions like Bhuddism?"

      I think studied is too formal a word...I've read just about
every religious book out there, in whole (the Bible) or in part (the
Gita, others). It's a good idea to be well-rounded.

                                                                  jms
