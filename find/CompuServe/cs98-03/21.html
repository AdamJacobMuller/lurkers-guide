      Thanks...the denouement or falling action is where you get to
show the consequences, that's often where a lot of the more interesting
things happen. Otherwise, it's just "okay, it's over" and that's it. 
I'm a big subscriber to the notion of proper dramatic structure, and I
try to hew to it on a large scale with the overall arc, and each
individual episode.  You can track every episode, and every season,
from the progression of introduction, rising action, complication,
climax and denouement.  I figure it's a solid literary framework that
has worked for several thousand years, it's *got* to be good enough for
TeeVee....
