      B5 has *killer* demographics, substantially better than Lois and
Clark, which did very good demos.

      But see, this is the trap...you let the other guy define the
argument for you, and the second they do that, they win the argument. 
"Unless B5 does as good as ST, then it ain't worth squat."  Well,
you're comparing a 5 year show against a 30 year franchise...apples and
oranges.  Now, if you want to compare B5 in its 5 years against the
original ST...then B5 wins, because we're on two years after they were
CANCELED.

      The fight is a dopey one on the face of it...caused by people
who want a fight between the shows, and want to define the argument
such that it makes everybody feel they have to defend something that
does not require *any* defense.

                                                                  jms
