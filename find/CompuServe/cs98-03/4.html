      Trivia...actually, the original Latin phrase (if I have this
right from memory) is "exceptio probat regulum," a colloquialism which
actually means "the exception puts the rulte to the test of proof." 
It's the bastardized interpretation which comes out to "exception
proves rule."

                                                                  jms
