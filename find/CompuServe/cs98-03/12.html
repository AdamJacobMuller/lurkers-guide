<pre> Darran Williams &lt;101656.2143@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I was just curious as to why Day of the Dead has been moved
&gt; forward to March 11th?

      We felt it wise to adjust the airing order so we could ramp up
the following episodes prior to the NBA delay without having any
interruption in the tone of the episodes (i.e., 2 tense, 1 funny, 2
tense vs 1 funny and 4 tense in a row).

                                                                  jms
