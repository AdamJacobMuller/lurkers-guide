<H2>Season 6?</H2>
<h3>Date: 23 Mar 1998 16:58:03 -0700</h3>
<pre> Lenier &lt;101671.630@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I know, or thought I knew that B5 followed a 5 year arc, so what
&gt; is the truth?

      No, there is no season 6, whatever you may have read in SFX
(which also got the facts wrong with the Caitlin Brown interview).

                                                                  jms
