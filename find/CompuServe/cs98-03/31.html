<H2>DotD Writing Question</H2>
<h3>Date: 12 Mar 1998 13:33:03 -0700</h3>
<pre> Anita Karve &lt;73653.3253@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Do you give them a framework and let them run with it?
&gt; How do you maintain the continuity while working with someone
&gt; from the outside?

      It varies, I get involved to different degrees with different
writers; with Neil, it was more "What do you want to write?"  He
noodled around with some ideas, ran one past me that he liked, and I
liked it...he asked for a truckload of scripts for reference, picked
the characters he wanted to use, researched them, we talked on the
phone and via email a number of times as he refined his ideas further,
then wrote the script.  I tucked and nipped a little here and there,
but pretty much left it alone.

                                                                  jms
