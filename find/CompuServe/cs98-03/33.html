<H2>News from AOL?</H2>
<h3>Date: 13 Mar 1998 00:07:14 -0700</h3>
<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;75063.3305@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is this correct?
&gt; Have you already made your choices regarding the casting of both
&gt; of the new movies and the new series? Is there anything you can
&gt; comment on here?

      This is not quite correct, but that's all I can say for now. 
There are one or two actors who might slide to Crusade, depending on
circumstances, and we have spoken to them on the QT about it...which is
probably why this was said, because I asked the actors in question not
to say anything until we got closer to seeing how things were going to
work out; the inquiries were mainly of an "if we had this role, would
you be interested in doing it?" nature, checking avails and
possibilities so we could plan accordingly.

                                                                  jms
