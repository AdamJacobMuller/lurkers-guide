<H2>Script Standards?</H2>
<h3>Date: 23 Mar 1998 22:47:07 -0700</h3>
<pre> Rebecca Eschliman &lt;76072.2345@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Do you write a script intentionally just a bit over, since it
&gt; would be easier to edit down than to scramble to add the
&gt; necessary after editing? If so, have you ever written a script
&gt; that came in *exactly* as you wrote it?

      You never know exactly how long it's going to be on film; you
ballpark the page count, and sometimes you come in a bit long,
sometimes you come in a bit short.  We're usually pretty close to time,
and only have to do small line cuts.  Easier to trim than to add after
the fact.

                                                                  jms
