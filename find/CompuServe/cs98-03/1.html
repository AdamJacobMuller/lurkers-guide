<H2>Thirdspace - WHEN?</H2>
<h3>Date: 27 Feb 1998 21:23:14 -0700</h3>
<pre> Michael L. Wonch &lt;73373.3533@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is that REALLY necessary?

      Clarification...I checked my figures, and apparently it's either
the 9th or the 19th of July for Thirdspace...they've moved it up at TNT
from their original November plans as sort of a way of giving a present
to B5 fans after having to wait for the NBA Playoffs to finish.

                                                                  jms
