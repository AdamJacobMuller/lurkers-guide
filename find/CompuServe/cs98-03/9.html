<pre> Ed Brandt &lt;100274.2672@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Also, I heard WAY back that there was a possible third movie in
&gt; the plans that might touch on the Valen/Sinclair story?

      There have been discussions, but nothing firm as of this time.

                                                                  jms
