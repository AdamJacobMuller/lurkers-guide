<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Who was broadcasting Lyta's memories while she was making love to
&gt; Byron? Was Lyta's mental "power" so strong that the other teeps
&gt; couldn't help but "hear" it? Was the "joining" of Lyta's and
&gt; Byron's minds such a strong force that it "leaked" into the other
&gt; teeps minds? Or was Byron broadcasting what should have been very
&gt; private information without asking Lyta for permission first?

      It was everything being stimulated, and coming to the surface,
mainly from her, but echoing off him.

                                                                  jms
