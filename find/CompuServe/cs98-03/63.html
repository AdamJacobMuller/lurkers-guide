<H2>B5 after TNT?</H2>

      Interestingly, one of the requirements of the shows that began
under PTEN is that they must show a profit *the very first year*,
rather than having to wait for the long run...so B5 has been turning a
profit for WB since the first day.

      Not that my statement reflects this, natch, and never will,
because then they'd have to actually *pay* me some of those profits....

                                                                  jms
