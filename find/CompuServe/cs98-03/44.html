<pre> Shawn D. Ratner &lt;73753.175@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; How do you feel now that the 5 year arc is completed?
&gt; How was the feeling on the set today while filming "Wheel of
&gt; Fire" compared to "Sleeping in Light"? What do you plan to do now
&gt; that the series has been completed?

      Thanks, for all that.

"How do you feel now that the 5 year arc is completed?"

      Exhausted, but relieved; we made it to the end.  We did what we
said we were going to do, and nobody and nothing can take that away
from us.

"How was the feeling on the set today while filming "Wheel of Fire"
compared to "Sleeping in Light"?"

      The last ep filmed today is "Objects at Rest."  The attitude was
a bit different than SiL, because there was some hope of a fifth season
that took some of the edge off SiL...but here it's clear: I said this
was a 5 year series, and it ends at five years, so everyone knew this
was it, at least for the series.  There were a lot of tears, hugging,
some speeches...it was hard.

"What do you plan to do now that the series has been completed?"

      Make the next TV movies, and get going on the next project.

                                                                  jms
