<H2>Thirdspace - WHEN?</H2>
<h3>Date: 03 Mar 1998 11:39:02 -0700</h3>
<pre> Philip Hornsey &lt;74053.2101@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; another one?
&gt; These the ones already in the can or is TNT just going hog wild?
&gt; Have you asked if they would be willing to give you two hours to
&gt; go out on and make up the additional time with something like a
&gt; big wrap up of the making of the show?

      No, the episode is the episode; the only reason I could get in
15 minutes back in the pilot was because I could find 15 minutes to cut
*out* to make room for it easily, and still maintain the same basic
running time.  SiL is as tight as it's ever gonna get.

                                                                  jms
