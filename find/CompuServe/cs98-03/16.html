<pre> Gardner L. Harris &lt;76657.3333@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; In that society is love making not considered a private/personal
&gt; matter? A more mundane question: was the scene difficult to shoot;
&gt; was Pat concerned about doing a nude scene or was it shot so that
&gt; a body double was used for all nude/semi-nude shots? Any comments?

      I had the group there to further reinforce their tightness, and
that it's a different way of living...as for Pat, no, no body double
was used.

                                                                  jms
