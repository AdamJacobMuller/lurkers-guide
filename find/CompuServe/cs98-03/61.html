<H2>Word on Severed DVD yet?</H2>
<h3>Date: 24 Mar 1998 22:31:02 -0700</h3>
<pre> Brian Prothero &lt;76711.663@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Any word on the "Severed Dreams" DVD yet?
&gt; If you do go ahead with the DVD, do you know if it will be
&gt; released in 16:9 "anamorphic" widescreen (aka enhanced wide
&gt; screen)? Does that mean that the character name will be cut off
&gt; when viewed in widescreen? Do you have any idea if/when Babylon 5
&gt; is released there will be 3 episodes on each DVD?

      Haven't heard anything new, no.

                                                                  jms
