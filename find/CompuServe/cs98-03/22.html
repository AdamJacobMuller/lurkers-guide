<pre> T.P.Chai &lt;104674.3064@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Did that first appearance lead to the subsequent roles?
&gt; was he cast as Morann first or Byron first?

      We were impressed by his portrayal of Minbari, and that led to
him coming in for Byron.

                                                                  jms
