<H2>Episode Name Change?</H2>
<h3>Date: 15 Mar 1998 00:50:11 -0700</h3>
<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Cat and Mouse)" part simply because this was the working title
&gt; that we've all seen on the upcoming episode lists, or is there
&gt; something more to it? Is there anything to the "Tradgedy"
&gt; spelling, or is it a TNT mistake?

      It's a typo on their parts...and Cat and Mouse was a) a working
title which I kept out there to b) avoid possible spoiling of various
directions for as long as possible.

                                                                  jms
