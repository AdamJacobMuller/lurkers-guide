<pre> Brian F. Swisher &lt;74642.2701@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is it something to do with the still-independent nature of B5's
&gt; status, or is there some other reason? Or is there something going
&gt; on behind the scenes that we're not aware of?

      Actually, I seem to recall he got a promotion from LT junior
grade to full lieutenant a couple of years ago...he'd probably get one
in year six.

                                                                  jms
