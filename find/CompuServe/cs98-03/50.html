      Thanks...there are times I've felt the same way, not wanting to
deal with it because I knew this was it.  It's natural and
understandable. Endings are always hard.  And, of course, beginnings
are also hard.  Then again, middles are particularly hard.  So I guess
if we consider it all hard, then one shouldn't be any worse than the
other.

      Fitting too that the last day of shooting was the first day of
spring, a new beginning....

                                                                  jms
