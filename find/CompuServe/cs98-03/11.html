<pre> Dan T. Davis &lt;71121.1254@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Has that show been moved up to March 11?
&gt; How does this relate to how the Centauri did the same thing to
&gt; the race that developed in parallel with them? ("What did the last
&gt; (parallel-Centauri-race) say as he died?

      Yes, Neil's episode is up next...and as for the Xon, the
difference is that the Centauri main-line clashed with the Xon when
both were primitive and fighting for food, resources, that sort of
thing, similar to our Neanderthal - Cro Magnon struggle, whereas the
Hyach did it when they were more advanced, and it wasn't a struggle,
more of a program of extermination.

                                                                  jms
