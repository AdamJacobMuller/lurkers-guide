      You're correct; a number of folks have told TNT that they're
waiting until seeing all the S1-4 episodes before watching season 5, so
they're timing the new cycle of S5 eps, starting from the beginning, so
these folks can catch up after the end of the S1-4 episodes.

                                                                  jms
