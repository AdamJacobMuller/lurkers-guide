<H2>Thirdspace - WHEN?</H2>
<h3>Date: 02 Mar 1998 00:04:02 -0700</h3>
<pre>{original post had no questions}

      Just got clarification and verification: Thirdspace does indeed
air July 19th, and another B5 TV movie airs November 23rd, and one more
on January 3rd.

                                                                  jms
