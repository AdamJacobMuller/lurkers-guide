<h3>Date: 26 Oct 1998 16:53:04 -0700</h3>
<pre>      Posted this over on another system, figured I'd put it here as
well.

     Just thought I'd get this thread moving, though it's still a bit
  early, since news has started to break in other places.  Basically:
I've
  always loved comics (no secret there), and have always wanted to do
a
  title of my own, try to make it something special, as B5 was/is
special.

      I created the premise, went to Top Cow (my first and only choice
on
  this one), we met, we agreed...and now RISING STARS is set to debut
next
  April.  I've already turned in the first script (for the preview
issue),
  and will be getting down to writing issues 0 and 1 shortly.

      The story follows the events after the small town of Pederson,
  Illinois, is struck by a mass of energy from an unknown, but non-
  terrestrial source.  Everyone who was in utero at the time of the
flash
  is affected, resulting in 113 individuals who develop abilities of a
most
  unusual and highly individual form.  (The power is to some degree
shaped
  by who they are, just as they are shaped to some degree by the
power.)

       It is set in a realistic universe, timed to real-world events
(it
  covers a span of about 60 years, starting in about 1969), where
there
  have never been super-powered individuals before.  It looks at how
the
  world reacts to them, and how they react to the world.  We follow
these
  characters through their early years, into adulthood and to the ends
of
  their lives, mapping all the changes they go through, and how they
change
  the world.

       It's an extremely ambitious 24 issue miniseries (with the
potential
  to go back and further develop any of the stories presented earlier
along
  the way).
