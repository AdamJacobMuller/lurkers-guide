<H2>Exec Producer powers?</H2>

      It variers; in some cases, an exec producer is just the money
person; in other cases, it can even be a studio person assigned to a
project; there can be numerous exec producers with various
responsibilities.  Some sell the show, move on, and just collect fees.

      That's why the term exec producer has become almost meaningless
in terms of knowing what the person actually *does*, and why it's been
replaced in many ways with the term "show runner."  That's the person
who actually runs the show, determines the creative direction for the
series, writes and oversees scripts, that sort of thing.

                                                                  jms
