<H2>Lyta Question</H2>
<h3>Date: 01 Oct 1998 23:58:05 -0700</h3>
<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Why did Lyta train as a Psi Cop if she was only a P5?

"I was under the impression teeps needed to be at least P10 before
becoming Psi Cops. Why did Lyta train as a Psi Cop if she was only a
P5?"

      You are misremembering.  She said she interned with the Psi
Cops, not that she was training to be one.  Psi Cops need people
beneath them at various levels as assistants, collectors of evidence,
and all the more ordinary stuff they don't have time to do as the
elite.

                                                                  jms
