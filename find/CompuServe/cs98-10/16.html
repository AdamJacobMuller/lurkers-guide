<H2>Season 5 in Siberia?</H2>
<h3>Date: 20 Oct 1998 11:37:07 -0700</h3>
<pre> Koslosky &lt;102365.2062@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; What's with TNT relegating season 5 to Siberia?
&gt; 12 o'clock mid-night for the rest of the season?
&gt; Can you shed some light on this (no pun intended regarding the
&gt; last ep)?

      The first new S5 ep is on next Wednesday at 10, not midnight; I
don't know what you're referring to.

                                                                  jms
