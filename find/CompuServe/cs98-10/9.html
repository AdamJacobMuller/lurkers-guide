      Be advised that Tracy Scoggins will not be there, and that
others may not be there, and that this is not an official, sanctioned
convention (many have emailed me to say that they thought it was
sanctioned).  The companies listed as "sponsors" -- Precedence
Publishing and Sierra FX -- are making it clear, and making VorCon make
sure it's clear, that they may be sponsoring events at the convention
but they do not endorse the convention itself; also, Optic Nerve will
not be bringing down an exhibit of any sort.  In addition, by now they
either have received or are about to receive official warning from 
Warner Bros. regarding the showing of *any* video material from the
show.
