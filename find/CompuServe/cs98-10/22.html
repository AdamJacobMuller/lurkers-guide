<pre> Carl Cantarella &lt;105030.3700@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is there any possibility that we'll be able to purchase it from
&gt; the Emporium? BTW, when are they going to update the Emporium?
&gt; What's the deal with that?

      There's been some problems with the company providing the web
site, and we're working to address that.

                                                                  jms
