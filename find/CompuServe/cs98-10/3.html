<pre> Rebecca Eschliman &lt;76072.2345@compuserve.com&gt; asks:

&gt; if so, what the result will be?

"Whether it be in CIS fora or on the wider Net, it seems that more
people are spreading more rumors more widely with more reaction.  I
wonder if this will ever reach some sort of critical mass, and, if so,
what the result will be?"

      A slight but measurable increase in the greenhouse effect....
