<pre> Roseann &lt;103510.1542@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Heard that Jeri Taylor left Star Trek, any chance that she'll
&gt; come and work with you on Crusade? Any chance that you will work
&gt; with Angela Landsbury on Crusade? Do you know what a vacation is?
&gt; Have you ever owned, been owned by or currently residing with any
&gt; cats and if so, got any good stories for us? Is that just on the
&gt; 'Net or here as well? Is there anyone in the business (actor,
&gt; director, writer, etc) that you haven't yet worked with, but
&gt; would like to?

1.  Heard that Jeri Taylor left Star Trek, any chance that she'll come
and work with you on Crusade?

      No, she's hoping to move to Northern California and enter
semi-retirement with her husband, also a friend of mine.  After X-
number of years in the business, we're all entitled to escape.

2.  Any chance that you will work with Angela Landsbury on Crusade?  I
think she's pretty cool.

      I don't think she does cable episodic.

3.  Do you know what a vacation is?

      Does it have fur?

4.  Have you ever owned, been owned by or currently residing with any
cats and if so, got any good stories for us? (you write about them as
if you know them well)

      Yes, but the cat cabal is very chary of its secrets, and if I
betray them they will come after me.

5.  I know that you plan on pulling back regarding your online
presence.  Is that just on the 'Net or here as well?

      Mainly pulling back on the newsgroups, somewhat here.

6.  Is there anyone in the business (actor, director, writer, etc)
that you haven't yet worked with, but would like to?

      Yeah, but it wouldn't be fair to name folks.

                                                                  jms
