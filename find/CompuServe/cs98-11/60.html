<pre> Roseann &lt;103510.1542@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; That was you that turned off the lights?
&gt; Knowing how much it bothers you to have your work edited and
&gt; rewritten by others, was it/is it tough for you when you have to
&gt; do that to a collegue? It must be a necessary evil in some cases,
&gt; yes? Do you tend to or try to keep it to a minimum?
&gt; Or does it depend on the story, writer's experience, etc?
&gt; Has it ever been an intimidating experience for you?

      Thanks....

      Yeah, that was me...and rewriting somebody else is as easy or
hard as the other person makes it.

                                                                  jms
