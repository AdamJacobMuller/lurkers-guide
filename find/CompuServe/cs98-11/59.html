<pre> Roseann &lt;103510.1542@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Um, that was you, right?

"My boy toy was saying he couldn't believe that you had Sherridan go,
but not have DeLenn with him; but I found it appropriate that he would
do that.  My guess was (correct me if I'm wrong), that like David, he
didn't want anyone to remember him any other way.  He wanted their last
thoughts of him to be not of him dying but who and what he was before
that."

      Exactly.

      And thanks for the kind words.

                                                                  jms
