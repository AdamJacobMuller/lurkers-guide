<pre> Janetch &lt;112013.1636@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; There were several years of wondering "who the hell are the
&gt; Shadows" (and the Vorlons) and what do they want? What else can I
&gt; say, but "a job well done"? Do you get tired of the constant
&gt; accolades from your fans? If this has been an experiment, after
&gt; seven years what are the results?

      Thanks for the kind words, and good luck with your ventures.

      What's the final result?  I hope a document, thousands of pages
long, that chronicles the making of a show on every level, so that
average folks can better understand the process and, thus, better
communicate what it is they want, on the theory that you can never have
what you want until you know how to ask for it, and what your options
are.

      That, and maybe making some people think...if even that is
accomplished, then the experiment was worthwhile.

                                                                  jms
