<pre> Joseph Schierer &lt;76326.3124@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; "Will we ever find out what happened to the missing day in
&gt; Sinclair's life, and will we ever find out what happened to
&gt; Babylon 4?" now, the show is over - but did I miss something?
&gt; the "little surprise" Londo left Sheriden &amp; Delenn for their
&gt; child - whatever happens to it? does Londo &amp; G'Kar meet their
&gt; mutual end, as "fortold" in War without end?

      Seems to me we answered all those questions except for the David
one in the course of the show.

                                                                  jms
