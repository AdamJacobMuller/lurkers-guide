<pre> Dave Vincent &lt;75460.1133@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Why was the station destroyed?
&gt; A hazard to navigation?
&gt; Why?
&gt; And why wouldn't it be kept as a permanent museum?

      Remember how much money and maintainance it would take to keep a
5 mile long station running.  They could barely do it when there was a
lot of tourism and business coming through; absent that, it's unviable,
and you don't just want to leave it there for folks to come in and take
over.

                                                                  jms
