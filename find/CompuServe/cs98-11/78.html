<pre> Janetch &lt;112013.1636@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; What's the moral of this?
&gt; Who knows?

"The biggest difference I noticed in your old posts was the "tone" --
you seemed more "upbeat". I guess the past 5 years of working 26 hour
days, dealing with online jerks, and fighting with the various suits
over renewal EVERY DAMN YEAR have taken a toll on your overall
outlook."

      It was a number of different factors, really...those wars, the
daily grind of writing and producing this show, the online experiment
(which was 90% terrific and 10% nutcases)...over time, it all takes a
real toll.

      (Somewhat related aside...I was redoing my list of credits the
other day for the PR file, which goes to reporters, and started adding
up how much of what I've written has been produced, on a per-hour
basis.  These are just the produced TV episodes -- half-hour and hour --
and TV movies, nothing else.

      (Came out that if you started watching it all, no repeats, 8
hours a day, it would take you slightly over 3 weeks to see it all.  I
went to lie down for a while after that one.)

                                                                  jms
