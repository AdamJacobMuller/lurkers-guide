<pre> Rebecca Costello &lt;71045.3050@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Can we interpret from this that teeps in general aren't her
&gt; people; just those who aren't willingly Corps?

      This is, of course, the key to the whole reason for the Byron
thing. If it had not gone on as long as it had, had not had the impact
it had on her, she would not be where she is now in the storyline.  You
really needed something *major* to bring her to this point, and that
was it.  Some couldn't figure why the emphasis...well, now they know.

      Everything points somewhere.

                                                                  jms
