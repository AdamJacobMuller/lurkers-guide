<pre> Janetch &lt;112013.1636@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Do you recall what was going on in your mind for that scene?
&gt; Is it not too personal that you are willing to share it?

      It's too hard to put into words...I looked around, knowing that
this could well be it, the last time I'd see this place.  It was just
real hard.

                                                                  jms
