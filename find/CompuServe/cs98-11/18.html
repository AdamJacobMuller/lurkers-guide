<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;75063.3305@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; If this really was what Sheen was doing, was this something he
&gt; came up with or did you have any say with how you saw the
&gt; character of the Soul Hunter being approached?

      What we had discussed (actor, director and me) was that soul
hunters don't generally get much chance to hang out and talk to people;
they can empathically sense the language, however, when they encounter
others.  At first, he didn't know the language very well, and gradually
became more able to express himself.

                                                                  jms
