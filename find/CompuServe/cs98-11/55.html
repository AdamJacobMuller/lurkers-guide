<pre> John Bovenmyer &lt;73567.1341@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Your idea or Stephen's?
&gt; Was it the producer, writer or director who talked the creator
&gt; into becoming an actor?

      Thanks, and I suggested the wave 'cause it's what he would do. 
Stephen agreed.

                                                                  jms
