<H2>Hey, Joe! &lt;ROS&gt;</H2>
<h3>Date: 10 Nov 1998 12:28:00 -0700</h3>
<pre> Michael Beemer &lt;71551.1670@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; ...What did Tracey say when she saw the lengths you went to to
&gt; get her into a bustier and garters?

      Her reaction on reading the script was to go on an immediate
crash diet, saying, "I want to make the boys cry."
