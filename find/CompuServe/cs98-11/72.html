<pre> Gar Harris &lt;76657.3333@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Let's see, where's that Indian restaurant?

      It's never been done before; and likely won't again, at least
for a long time.  But the interaction, for me, has been worth it.

                                                                  jms
