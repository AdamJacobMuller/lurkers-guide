"On a personal note, I have been dreading this last episode, not so
much because of the story, but more because of it's being the end of
Babylon 5. Now that I have watched it I must tell you that I don't feel
depressed or sad. Yes, it was a very moving episode but also an
uplifting story, and I actually feel good.  Like I just finished a good
book, which of course I have except that I watched it rather than read
it."

      That's pretty much the reaction that others have had, which is
what I was hoping for...because in a strange way, as much as it's an
ending, it's also about hope and new beginnings and renewal.

      Thanks....
