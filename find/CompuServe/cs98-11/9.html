      If you saw the arrows initially, then they would have been 'way
too obvious.

      And yeah, the wheel of fire visually has spokes proceeding out
from a central flame; the center burns outward.  And several of the
fires smoldering lately have done that; with Byron it was a literal
flame that has now gone out along the spokes and had substantial
repercussions, with more to come years down the road.

      It's also a Shakespeare quote, "I am bound upon a wheel of fire,
that mine own tears do scald like molten lead."  Which tends to
describe Londo's situation as well.  (King Lear)

                                                                  jms
