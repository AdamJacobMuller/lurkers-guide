      Thanks; a lot of folks have come out of lurker-zone on this one,
and it's been great to hear the voices.

      As for Eep, I guess I picked it because it's so small that you
might miss it, it was vague enough not to get me in trouble, and it's
kind of a mouse sound.

                                                                  jms
