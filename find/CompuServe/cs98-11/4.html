<pre> Roseann &lt;103510.1542@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Are you going to stick to pretty much writing your own stuff or
&gt; will you still consider guest writing for any other shows? Would
&gt; you consider asking Chris Carter to write and episode of Crusade? 
&gt; Have they asked you yet?

      I don't believe anyone has spoken to me about Icon yet...as for
other shows, I'm kinda spoiled...I don't like to have my words mucked
about with, and on somebody else's show, that's inevitable.

                                                                  jms
