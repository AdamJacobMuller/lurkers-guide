<pre> DougP &lt;70760.2440@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; when Sheridan and Lorien are together and Lorien asks him "do you
&gt; have any reason worth living?" Did you make any special notes in
&gt; the script of Objects at Rest?

      Yeah, my instructions to Chris were the same there as for
another scene next week, "break our hearts."  And the two themes are
actually pretty much the same, since they proceed from similar
contexts.  That section of "Rest" just puts me away every time.

                                                                  jms
