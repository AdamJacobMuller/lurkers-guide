<pre> Craig M. Bobchin &lt;102354.3246@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Was Delenn looking out at the sunrise this scene?
&gt; If so it why would it provoke that sort of reaction?
&gt; If this was not the final scene, what was it going to be?

      It was the station blowing up, and the shuttle leaving, and the
coda, and the sunrise.

                                                                  jms
