<pre> Evan Zucker &lt;73067.1455@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I am purposely avoiding any spoilers for Crusade so I can enjoy
&gt; the episodes as I see them, but since I've read there is some
&gt; connection between B5 and Crusade, can you tell us whether the
&gt; David arc will be picked up in Crusade? Do you also appear in one
&gt; of the Producers photos just before the closing credits?

      It'd be hard to pick up the David arc since he'll only be about
4 years old at the time Crusade starts.

                                                                  jms
