<pre> Michael Kalus &lt;100265.3065@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I am sure you got this message at least a 100 times, but how did
&gt; it feel to flip the switch that everything ended, after 4 years,
&gt; and how was the feeling after you could carry on with your Story?

      As noted elsewhere here...it was just real hard.

                                                                  jms
