<pre> Brian A. Thomas &lt;75231.1122@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Right?
&gt; So I have to wonder, when the Shadow War ends, will the Shadows
&gt; still be involved with those things?

     Never said that the shadow war ends this season.  I simply said
it wouldn't run all the rest of the series.  And even when a war is
over, the afteraffects can be felt for some time.  And there may be
related problems still to clean up.

                                                                  jms
