<h3>Date: 12-Feb-96 23:42:08</h3>
<pre> Rowan Kaiser &lt;74160.473@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; My question, then, is what happened to the Narn vote?
&gt; Did the Centauri get it, or did it just disappear?
&gt; Either way, wouldn't the balance be disrupted?

       The council has been more or less abandoned as infighting has
broken out.  It gets worse.

                                                                  jms
