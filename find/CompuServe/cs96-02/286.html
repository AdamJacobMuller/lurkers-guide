<pre> Michael E. MacDonal &lt;102371.1166@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; As i see you rarly do any thing that could not have meaning later
&gt; on I assume it got away for a reason ..and that we will be seeing
&gt; it again ?

       As a matter of fact, yes, you'll be seeing the Na'Kal later
this season.
