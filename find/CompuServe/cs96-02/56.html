<H2>B5 Book #3: Blood Oath</H2>
<h3>Date: 06-Feb-96 00:05:26</h3>
<pre> John M. Kahane &lt;102664.773@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; How much of the Narn terminology and the like, not to mention the
&gt; details of the Narn homeworld, are accurate and canon?

     It's accurate in some places, not in others; details slip
sometimes.

                                                                  jms
