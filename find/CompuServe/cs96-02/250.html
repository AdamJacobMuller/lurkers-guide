<pre> Rebecca Eschliman &lt;76072.2345@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; If so, what is it that clues you in that you need a small break?

       No, usually it's not a problem, except when I get physically
tired at the end of a long day.  It's a full-immersion process only
from July through April; from April to June it's a bit slower, so I can
recuperate then (we don't shoot April to June).  I actually have very
little trouble living in the B5 universe with half my brain, and
hanging out here and the other nets with the other half of my brain. 
Granted, I don't have any brain left over for a personal life during
this period, but my personal life has always been pretty brainless, so
there you are.

                                                                  jms
