<H2>&lt;Rage's Thots: DtD&gt;</H2>
<h3>Date: 08-Feb-96 13:46:42</h3>
<pre> Chad Underkoffler &lt;102512.1310@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; *"Aren't you late for a bund meeting?"
&gt; My favorite lines, however, are Bester's "So you see me as a
&gt; pinata?" BTW, Joe, how do you write the Drazi speech pattern?
&gt; Drop all the articles?
&gt; Is that all?
&gt; Is this a Wm Goldman/Princess Bride nod?
&gt; Or am I *way* too into looking for stuff like this?
&gt; *Jeez, Kosh is a manipulative little &lt;bleep&gt;, ain't he?
&gt; *Bester's comment to his partner "You couldn't have gotten here 2
&gt; min earlier, could you?"

     Actually, just to clarify the legalese, the judge sentenced him
to *no less* than 60 days; that's the minimum, it could be more.

                                                                  jms
