<pre> Ray Pelzer &lt;70475.1263@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Which reminds me: what was the outcome of your "study" into how
&gt; the station-by-station numbers were being reported (falsified
&gt; airdates, etc.)???

       We found that the research division wasn't being updated on air
schedules; the new reports now feature accurate ratings for accurate
times, which gives us a *much* better understanding of what's going on.

                                                                  jms
