<H2>B5 &amp; TNT</H2>
<h3>Date: 20-Feb-96 11:49:55</h3>
<pre> Frank J. Furfaro &lt;74031.1005@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Since TNT has purchased the rights to B5 for 5 years, doesn't
&gt; that pretty much assure that PTEN would continue B5 for 5 years? 
&gt; Or is this agreement flexable depending on B5's year-to-year
&gt; renewal and TNT would just get whatever is produced?

       The agreement is flexible; WB has the option of doing just 3
years, but I'm reasonably sure that TNT would like a lot more

                                                                  jms
