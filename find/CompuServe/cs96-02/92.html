<pre> SysOp Dupa T Parrot &lt;70040.104@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Did G'Kar see G'Quon or G'Lan (as portrayed by Kosh)?

     The figure he was talking through during the scene appeared to
him as his father; the very last figure, seen departing, was that of
G'Lan.

                                                                  jms
