<pre> Joel Hilke &lt;102354.1702@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is he conning everyone?
&gt; Does he really think that everything he does is for the greater
&gt; good of earth?

      "Dust to Dust" is what I call one of my "pretty box" episodes. 
I set down the pretty box in front of you, and you think you know what
it is. Then something else entirely jumps out of it at your face. 
There's more coming here and there.  I like pretty boxes....
