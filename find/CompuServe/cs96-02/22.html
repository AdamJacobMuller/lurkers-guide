     If you're talking about the conference room scene...Draal wasn't
put into the scene digitally.  You do a split screen, with the camera
locked off.  In one Delenn walks over to a point just short of the
line; in another you get a shot just of the wall; then Draal walks up. 
You then use a dissolve technique to fade him into the room on his side
of the split screen.  But he's not being put *into* the room, he's
already there, so he's neither bigger nor smaller than he is in real
life, since he IS in real life there, not added in.

                                                                  jms
