<pre> Tom Knudsen &lt;72347.1626@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; WHEN!!???!!!!
&gt; That means that after this group of 5 episodes we're going to
&gt; have NINE more weeks of reruns?? How many episodes are they going
&gt; to save till next year THIS time??? Seven???
&gt; Eight??
&gt; How can WB expect this show to get any decent ratings whatsoever
&gt; if they never show any fraggin new episodes? Can they really
&gt; believe that they can show 8 weeks of reruns at a time and then
&gt; bang, show new episodes only during sweeps periods, and expect
&gt; the ratings to be there as soon as new episodes start?? Why the
&gt; hell can't they show B5 episodes in groups of 7 or 8?? Would it
&gt; help if us, the fans, started a write in campaign to Dick
&gt; Roberton (I think that's his name) and give him a wake up call?

     Dick Robertson isn't to blame for the schedule, apparently; it's
a decision made jointly by the stations.

                                                                  jms
