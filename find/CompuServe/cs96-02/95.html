<h3>Date: 08-Feb-96 22:50:39</h3>
<pre> Andrew J. Puckett &lt;75143.267@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Was there any change made to the opening music in "Voices of
&gt; Authority" (as opposed to third season episodes preceding it)?

     Nope, no change in the music at all.  You're probably just more
used to it now.

                                                                  jms
