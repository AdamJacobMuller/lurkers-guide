<pre> Dan T. Davis &lt;71121.1254@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Also, I enjoyed seeing "The Book of G'Kar" - maybe a new
&gt; testament? Is this the first episode that fairly directly ties in
&gt; to either the comic or the books?

       Yes, what he's writing will, in time, become the Book of G'Kar.

       And correct, I went for a different feel in this episode, on
the theory that a little change is a good thing, if used to a purpose. 
It's built like a series of waves, with quite moments in between.

       This is the second so far to strongly tie into the comic, yes.

                                                                  jms
