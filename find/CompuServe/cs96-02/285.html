<pre> Mara K. Malovany &lt;102750.1414@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I know the show needs PR to help expand the audience and improve
&gt; ratings &amp; time-slots, and I do enjoy reading the occasional
&gt; interview, but is there any way for you to control the media once
&gt; they do take notice? But, if/when the media turns the spotlight on
&gt; B5, are we going to end up with the situation Trek faces, where
&gt; lazy reporters think that giving away the ending is the same as
&gt; writing an article? Do you think you will be able to continue
&gt; doing so?

       If presidents, ministers and generals can't control the media,
we have little chance of doing so.  So we just have to try to keep
things close to the vest on our own (which is why the title for 322 is
classified for now).

                                                                  jms
