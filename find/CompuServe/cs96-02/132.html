<pre> Mara K. Malovany &lt;102750.1414@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; And that piece used during the flash of images from Londo's mind
&gt; was perfect, was it new?

      With some thematic exceptions, most of the music Chris composes
for us each week is unique, and tailored for that episode.  So yes,
it's all mainly new.

      Re: the coat of welcoming...here's a little tidbit...we had to
make up an entire alphabet for most of our major races (and I've been
gradually building up a dictionary here and there for languages).  So
they came and asked if they could embroider something in Minbari on the
shirt Vir's wearing when he comes back.  I said sure.  Did I have
anything in mind?  No, not really.

      So I'm on the set that day, and I see the embroidered shirt, and
I ask what these five letters spell, since I don't offhand read Minbari
yet.  He looked up at me and smiled.  "It spells out ALOHA."

      We have a very demented crew.

                                                                  jms
