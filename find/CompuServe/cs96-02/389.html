<h3>Date: 28-Feb-96 00:15:17</h3>
<pre> Trent K. Johnson &lt;71020.1052@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; So we can also expect the trigger to be pulled somewhat regarding
&gt; the imbalance of power on the Grey Council? Thought we'd forgotten
&gt; about that, didn't you?

       Oh, it's coming, all right....

                                                                  jms
