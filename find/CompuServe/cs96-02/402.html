<pre> Burhaan Ahmad &lt;75754.3065@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Does G'Kar actually think of it as *The Book of G'Kar*, or does
&gt; he just feel he's writing an autobiography/history of sorts? What
&gt; I mean to say is, does G'Kar now fancy himself as being as
&gt; important as G'Quon?

       No, he hasn't thought of it that far yet...but it will find
that role.

                                                                  jms
