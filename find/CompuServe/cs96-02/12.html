<pre> David Belt &lt;72142.1365@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; My wife and I nearly died laughing and my kids kept asking "What?
&gt; What?"
&gt; What are Narns like?
&gt; Minbari?
&gt; Drazi?
&gt; Markab?
&gt; BTW, how did you get away with showing that part of Centauri
&gt; anatomy in TQOM? Were the censors asleep?
&gt; Did you bribe them?
&gt; Or were they just clueless?

     Nobody's what they seem around here...

     As for the tentacles...well, there's no rules about showing
tentacles on TV.  I think they didn't even want to deal with it.  There
are some moments when they pretend they didn't see it, and I pretend I
didn't write it.

                                                                  jms
