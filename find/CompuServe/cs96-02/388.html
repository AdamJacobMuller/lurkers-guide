<pre> Mike Hoffmann &lt;100321.2604@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Or doesn't it make a difference by then, as the decisions are
&gt; made in late April based on data picked from, say, February?

       No, I think they'll be looking at info right up until the time
they decide.

                                                                  jms
