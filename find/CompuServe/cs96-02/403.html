<pre> Robert Miller &lt;71501.3042@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; What is to prevent the people of Earth from believing Clarke's
&gt; move is exactly what it appears to be: a desperate act of a man
&gt; whose crimes are being brought out into the open? How can a man
&gt; who has been openly accused of assassination, who has some pretty
&gt; damning evidence backing up the accusations, and whose very
&gt; legitimacy is being investigated by the government, effectively
&gt; overthrow the government? For that matter, what are Clarke's
&gt; motivations? Is he just consumed by lust for power, or is there
&gt; something else going on?

       It all depends on how you frame the issue...i.e., the attacks
are groundless, baseless, and part of a campaign to destroy the
government, he's the attacked innocent....

                                                                  jms
