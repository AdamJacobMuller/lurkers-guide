<pre> Neil Blevins &lt;102226.3566@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; So after the 8 episode run, there will be more repeats, a few in
&gt; the summer, and then we won't see the end of the season until
&gt; october? I'm really happy about the 8 show solid chunk with no
&gt; repeats, but why on earth are they posponing the season finale to
&gt; october again?

       Because PTEN wants to hold episodes for sweeps periods. 
Nothing more.
