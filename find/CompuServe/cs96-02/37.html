<pre> Tom Knudsen &lt;72347.1626@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Can I infer from that statement that by the time we reach season
&gt; 5 we'll actually know just what that arc is?

     You'll pretty much have a sense of the overall arc's direction by
the end of this season.

                                                                  jms
