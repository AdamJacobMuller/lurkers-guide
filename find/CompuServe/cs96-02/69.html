<pre> John McAuley &lt;100260.412@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is this because they have to use trial and error to get it to
&gt; look right?

     The shot as filmed wasn't locked down (locked camera), and they
had to take the film and carefully insert the material so it wouldn't
look jumpy.

                                                                  jms
