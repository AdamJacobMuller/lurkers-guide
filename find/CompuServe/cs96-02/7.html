<pre> Barbara Pfieffer &lt;72302.2453@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Did you script the look of admiration Marcus gives Ivanova after
&gt; she gets her answer from the Walker? Musante's speech to the
&gt; Nightwatch--were you reading some of Herr Hitler's speeches
&gt; before writing that?

     Yeah, the Loki was a little nod, sort of appropriate to who she
was.

     The crew you see on the White Star doesn't reflect those in other
parts of the ship.  Also, being fairly advanced, it doesn't require a
big crew in command.  You could even fly it single-handedly if it came
to that.

     And yes, the historical parallels are definitely there.

                                                                  jms
