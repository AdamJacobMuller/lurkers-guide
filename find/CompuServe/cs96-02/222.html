<H2>8 NEW B5 EPS!</H2>

<pre> Kevin Hill &lt;74170.1015@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Since there aren't too many Ardwrights around, can I assume that
&gt; this is the same person in B5? Does he write on the side to
&gt; suppliment his meager income from B5&lt;grin!&gt;?

       Yes, I believe he does write as well, including some Robotech
stuff.

                                                                  jms
