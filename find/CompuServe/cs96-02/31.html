<pre> David Cerreta &lt;72630.3433@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Nothing is black and white in your Babylon 5 world, is it?
&gt; Who would have thought that at the end of this episode I would be
&gt; more frightened of Kosh than of Bester? Or maybe not...any news on
&gt; that front?

     We'll approach McGoohan when we have a script good enough for his
skills.

     RE: Bester...thanks.  I'd decided a while ago that the next time
we saw him, he either had to win, or he had to be right.  If he lost
again, it'd cut his credibility out.  This gave me a chance to do some
interesting things with him.  He's a fascinating guy...a creep, and I
wouldn't trust him for a second, but fascinating nonetheless....

                                                                  jms
