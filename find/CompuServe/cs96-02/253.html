<H2>&lt;MFE: Jumpgate&gt;</H2>
<h3>Date: 21-Feb-96 13:35:31</h3>
<pre> Gary Weinfurther &lt;71521.2352@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Why didn't Sheridan use the jumpgate trick against the shadow
&gt; ship like he did with the last one?

       Because there wasn't a jumpgate he had access to, only a jump
point created by the White Star.  In the prior situation, he blew up a
standing jump gate.  The only one in the vicinity would be at the
transfer point near Io, which if destroyed would seriously harm Earth
interests.

                                                                  jms
