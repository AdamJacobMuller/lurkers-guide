<H2>Minor Minbari Question:</H2>
<h3>Date: 25-Feb-96 16:07:38</h3>
<pre> John R. Finnan (Ireland) &lt;100012.3073@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; So, would this have been before after or *during* the last Shadow
&gt; war, which was also around 1000 years ago? For that matter, was
&gt; Valen and the Grey Council formed before/during or after the war? 
&gt; Or will we find this out when we find out the *true* history of
&gt; the Triluminaries???

       It'll be covered in the two-parter, to a large degree.

                                                                  jms
