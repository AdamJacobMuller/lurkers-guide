<pre> Phil Herscher &lt;71101.304@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; What were the effects of the Whitestar opening the Jump Point
&gt; within the atmosphere? Was the resulting blast assumed to be the
&gt; "enemy" ship being destroyed?

       I think they know the White Star (aka the unidentified ship)
got away, but they put the best face on it back home.  Which is one
more reason why Clark's declared martial law.  Things are spinning out
of control, he's in increasingly hot water back home, and he has to
seize control.  Whoever was in that alien ship knows too much about his
operations...if that were to come out, he's finished.

                                                                  jms
