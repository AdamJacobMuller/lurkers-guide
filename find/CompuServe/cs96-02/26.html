<pre> SysOp Dupa T Parrot &lt;70040.104@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Ok, Joe, what does "Zog" mean?
&gt; What is this species of First Ones called?
&gt; That scene with Zack and Political Officer Julie at breakfast:
&gt; Did Zack sorta flirt with her because he had the same sort of
&gt; interview with her the previous day that she tried to have with
&gt; Sheridan the night before?

     No, that wasn't the relationship between her and Zack, much as he
might've wished for it.  As for the walkers at sigma 957...the
recognition signal is their name, which is 15,000 letters long (we had
to cut this line for time).  So I can't really repeat it here.

                                                                  jms
