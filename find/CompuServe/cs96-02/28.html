     You didn't imagine it....

     Part of what appeals to me is the idea that the English/French
animosity you often see (though clearly not in all cases) would
continue not only into the future, but outside Earth.  Realistically,
if you go into Europe, you find people holding grudges 500 years old,
or more.  Seemed appropriate to carry this small one forward as well.

                                                                  jms
