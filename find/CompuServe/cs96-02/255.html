<pre> Philip Hornsey &lt;74053.2101@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; In your estimation, does the fact of the syndication agreement
&gt; with TNT make it more likely that season 4 and 5 will be done?

       It's a wash, won't make a difference either way.

                                                                  jms
