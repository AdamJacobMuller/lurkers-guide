<pre> Automedia, Inc. &lt;70530.2521@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Was this an something that slipped by unnoticed, or is it just a
&gt; result of the design of the arm band?

       It's probably a result of the printing on the armband as it
goes around.  The posters are all one-word.

       I think you hit the distinction between MfE and PoNR...the
former is exciting, the latter is tense, with "Severed Dreams" a good
blend of the two, particularly the latter.  We did our final producer's
cut today, and man, it moves....

                                                                  jms
