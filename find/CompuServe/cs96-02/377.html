<pre> Joe Salemi [ZD Net] &lt;72631.23@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Does this mean that General Hague was originally supposed to be
&gt; in MfE, or are you refering to something else?

       Foxworth was slated for "Severed Dreams" when he bailed on us.

                                                                  jms
