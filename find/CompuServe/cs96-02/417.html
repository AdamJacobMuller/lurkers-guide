<H2>&lt;Rage's Thots: PoNR&gt;</H2>
<h3>Date: 29-Feb-96 15:45:55</h3>
<pre> Chad Underkoffler &lt;102512.1310@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; It makes me wonder: what if Delenn had been on the station when
&gt; the riots/Nightwatch situation erupted? Maybe the Z-man should
&gt; have just tossed it over his shoulder? from his cell, to the
&gt; lighting of the candles (rekindling of hope lost in TLTS? You've
&gt; had it for *months*, okay? Clarke?
&gt; Him and the Nightwitch (Musante) are the type of people that have
&gt; Earth's best interest at heart? *Corwin, by his line "What did we
&gt; do wrong?" Did anyone else see Susan as Wednesday Addams sitting
&gt; there on the couch?

       "...I wanted Sheridan &amp;Co. to cut themselves free of Earthgov,
and they didn't."

       'Course, if you were to do anything that monumental, you'd
spike right smack in the middle of your three-part story.

       One of the things about these three episodes that's again worth
stressing is that they're really one story, linked carefully.  Each of
the three begins *one frame* after the other.  After they've aired, if
you sit down with a VCR and edit them together, you'll find that they
flow absolutely SEAMLESSLY from one to the other.  So PoNR is at the
dead center of the piece that propels you toward the last third, like
the second act in a three-act play (which was my structure for this).

       That may help.

                                                                  jms
