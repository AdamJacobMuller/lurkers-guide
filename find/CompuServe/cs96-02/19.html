<pre> Michael Zitaglio &lt;102545.641@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is the nightwatch going to start "cleansing" the lurkers from B5?
&gt; Is the book of G'Quon going to be the teachers edition with all
&gt; of the answers for the shadow war?

      Nightwatch has bigger goals than dealing with lurkers....

                                                                  jms
