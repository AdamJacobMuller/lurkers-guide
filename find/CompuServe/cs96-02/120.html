<H2>About the First Ones</H2>
<h3>Date: 10-Feb-96 22:59:58</h3>
<pre> Damian Reaves &lt;75373.2325@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Were the Ikkarans first ones ?
&gt; a)did they build the battle suits to fight off the shadows ?
&gt; b) will we ever see Ikkaran technology again ?
&gt; The Shadows have been out of commission for a 1000 years so is it
&gt; safe to assume that the Vorlons, the Walkers at Sigma957, and any
&gt; other first ones still out there have caught up with them
&gt; technologically? Were the Takarans first ones, and if not where
&gt; did the great machine come from?

     Neither the Ikarrans nor those on Epsilon 3 were First Ones.  And
the level of tech between Vorlons, Shadows and Walkers is fairly close.

                                                                  jms
