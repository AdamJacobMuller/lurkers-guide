<pre> John M. Kahane &lt;102664.773@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; That raises another question, however: What do you consider the
&gt; greatest challenge in writing B5 right now? That's just it, isn't
&gt; it?

       I think probably the hardest thing in the writing this season
has been in pulling the story through the next level, around the
corner, and into a new relative shape.  Some things are the same, and a
lot of things are different the deeper you go into this season.  It's
been a real tough act to get this boat where it needs to go, but I
think we pulled it off.

                                                                  jms
