<pre> John M. Kahane &lt;102664.773@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Btw, Joe, just exactly how does one write the organization name?
&gt; Is it "Nightwatch" or "Night Watch"?

       It's Nightwatch.

       The thread will diminish for a while, then return down the road
in later seasons, after the story takes its third major turn.

       By the last few episodes, pretty much all of my cards are on
the table. But by the last episode of this season, we find that the
game we've assumed we've been playing ain't necessarily the game at
all.  The show takes a fairly subversive direction, and of all the
seasons so far, the one that follows, year four, represents the
greatest writing challenge to make this actually work.

       Which is another reason why it's important to get the B4
storyline and several other threads out in the open, and clear the
decks, because this is gonna take every bit of whatever talent I've got
to pull off.

       Year four is the point in the novel when you're just past the
halfway mark; you know the reader thinks he or she has got the story
sussed out. The reader knows all your tricks by now, or thinks he/she
does.  You've been pulling doves out of your hat for 243 pages.

       Now you'd damned well better be able to pull out an alligator.

                                                                  jms
