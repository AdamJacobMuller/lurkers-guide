<pre> Rebecca Eschliman &lt;76072.2345@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is that supposed to serve some practical purpose for the union
&gt; members?

     Yes.  For instance, you're a star, and you say, "I want my name
to appear before the title."  So the next star says "Well, then I want
mine right after the title."  Editors' credits have to go in a specific
place in relation to the title.  And so on.  It's to help avoid
problems of dumping people's credits where they won't be seen.

                                                                  jms
