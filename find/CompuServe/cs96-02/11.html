<pre> John R. Finnan (Ireland) &lt;100012.3073@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; how were the ribs that day?

     The ribs were great.  What can I say...barbeque day here at the
stage is every Friday.  Choosing between ribs and a naked
woman...that's hard after age 40.

                                                                  jms
