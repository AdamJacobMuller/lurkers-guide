<H2>Where do baby narn come</H2>
<h3>Date: 01-Feb-96 13:56:26</h3>
<pre> Philip Hornsey &lt;74053.2101@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Where does the fetus develop, and from where is it born?
&gt; Is Minbari physiology similer to human, or significantly
&gt; different (such as the Centauri)? Is this accurate?

     The padded out area of Centauri males is where their genitalia
(their tentesticles) are located.

                                                                  jms
