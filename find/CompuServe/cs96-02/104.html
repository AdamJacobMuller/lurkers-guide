<pre>{original post had no questions}

     You could've sent me a note describing the photos; I could've
told you what they were.

     Also, the statment "a Fox network series" is incorrect; some Fox
stations carry us, but we're a PTEN series, no relation to Fox
whatsoever. So you have double reason to complain about the insert.

     I look forward to the article.

                                                                  jms
