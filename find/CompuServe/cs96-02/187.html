<h3>Date: 14-Feb-96 23:54:53</h3>
<pre>       No, no, it doesn't mean what it says.  But how else can one
announce that B5's own Conceptual Consultant, Harlan Ellison, will be
appearing at the Cartoon Art Museum at 814 Mission Street in San
Francisco on Friday, March 1st, from 6-8 p.m.?  This Evening with
Ellison goes for only $15 per person, and is a benefit to raise funds
for museum.  For more info, call 1-415-CARTOON.

                                                                  jms
