<pre> JAMES A. O'BRIEN &lt;70661.2342@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is there any word as to what will happen to B5 after the 5 year
&gt; arc has run its course? I know ratings will play a major role in
&gt; any decision, but has JMS ever said anything about what might
&gt; happen beyond the 5 years?

       From the start, I've indicated that there's a side-story that
could go off in the B5 universe after the 5 year story is up, but it
wouldn't be B5. Frankly, however, given the current state of the
syndication market, I'd suggest that the odds of that happening are
slim and none.

       So barring anything truly exceptional -- like someone handing
me an anthology series -- my plan at the moment is to retire from TV at
the end of the five years and go back to writing novels and plays.  At
that point, I think I'll have said just about everything I want to say
for TV.

                                                                  jms
