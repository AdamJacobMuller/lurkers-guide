<pre> Robert Miller &lt;71501.3042@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Just out of curiosity, what was Joshua Cox's reaction when he
&gt; read the script for "Exogenesis" and found out his character
&gt; actually got to get out of C&amp;C?

       He loved it.

                                                                  jms
