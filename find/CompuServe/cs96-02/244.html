<pre> Harold Eckstein &lt;72253.3332@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; These are some questions I have about the logic or correctness of
&gt; some of the situations: 1) Should Sheridan have shown such little
&gt; anger when he catches Ivanova about to kill Bester? 2) Was that
&gt; right that Sheridan's staff speak before he gives them permission
&gt; and before he finishes? (He was laying down the law to Bester near
&gt; the start of the episode.) 3) Garibaldi can bring Ashi in so
&gt; easily, grab his hair, intimidate him a little and he caves? This
&gt; is the guy who has his hands in major crimes on the station? 5)
&gt; Why should G'Kar be so voluble with Lindstrom, revealing the Narn
&gt; (or his own) plans for the dust? Is a drunk driver not to be held
&gt; accountable for injury he causes after he drinks, because he
&gt; can't control himself when he is drunk?

       Thanks.  The stories ebb and flow at different paces, some
slower, some faster, depending on the nature of the story.  I try to
give each one a separate flavor.  Where it may become a hassle is that
some folks, myself included sometimes, tend to flip pages in a novel to
get to the exciting stuff...but the interim parts, though slower, are
where you get to know the characters and care for them, so that what
happens later has consequence.

                                                                  jms
