<pre> David Belt &lt;72142.1365@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Do they protrude or extend from what would correspond (on humans)
&gt; from the navel area or groin area? Where are the Centauri female
&gt; orifices located and do they have more than one?

     Actually, Centauri have six.  They extend out from the sides of
the body, and "fold" in over the solar plexus when not in, er, use. 
(We actually saw one extended for other purposes in the first season,
"The Quality of Mercy.") Female Centauri have six...er...slotted areas
on either side of the spine, just above the hips, three on either side.

     To go any further would probably bring in the FBI.

                                                                  jms
