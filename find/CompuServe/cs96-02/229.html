<pre> FitzGeralds &lt;103571.3245@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Did she really think she could evaluate him in such a short time?
&gt; What else should he have said?
&gt; Could he trust her?

       Thanks.  Yes, I tend to find *process*...the going from one
state to another, to be interesting.  Growth not only provides drama,
it can often produce irony, tragedy, and comedy, and ah *loves* all of
those.

                                                                  jms
