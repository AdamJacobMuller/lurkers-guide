<h3>Date: 13-Feb-96 19:04:48</h3>
<pre> Barbara Pfieffer &lt;72302.2453@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Are you still working on "And the Rock Cried Out, No Hiding
&gt; Place"? Do you have any idea what the titles of the final two
&gt; scripts of the season will be? Will we *see* General Hague again
&gt; this season or is he still busy subverting Star Fleet from the
&gt; inside?

       Just turned in the script for "Rock," so that leaves just two
left to write.  I haven't decided on a title for 21 yet, out of several
options, and the title of 22 is classified for now.

                                                                  jms
