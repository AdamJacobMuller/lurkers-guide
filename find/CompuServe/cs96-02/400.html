<pre> Christopher R. Turn &lt;71470.1536@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Have you made any decision yet on attending the San Diego ComiCon
&gt; this year?

       I'll definitely be at SDCC...it's my favorite place to shop and
go nuts every year.

                                                                  jms
