<pre> Barbara Pfieffer &lt;72302.2453@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is this a mistake?
&gt; Second, what is the symbol on the floor of the White Star?

       Per accident he began writing right to left; Narn is left to
right, so we flopped the shot.

       The symbol on the WS isn't on the floor, it's the top of a
console that can be used for holographic tactical displays.

                                                                  jms
