<pre> John M. Hawkins &lt;71742.160@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Even so, I wonder how many of us could recognize modernized
&gt; versions of the events leading up to the Thrity Years War, or the
&gt; rise of Cromwell, both in the 17th Century, about as far removed
&gt; from our time as we are from B5's?

       Yes, we have seen it before...and we're seeing it now...and
we're going to see it again in future.

       Someone once remarked, "Of course everything has already been
said. But since no one was paying attention, we must begin again."

                                                                  jms
