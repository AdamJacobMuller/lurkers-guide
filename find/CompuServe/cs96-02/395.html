<h3>Date: 28-Feb-96 11:57:28</h3>
<pre> Philip Hornsey &lt;74053.2101@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Are Varn's People First Ones (I *believe* you said they were
&gt; not)? Was the Great Machine built by a race of First Ones or by
&gt; Varn's People? Is the Great Machine capable of seeing *everywhere*
&gt; or can it be blocked (by say the Shadows or Vorlon)?

       No, Varn's people aren't first ones...and the machine can be
blocked.

                                                                  jms
