<pre> Rowan Kaiser &lt;74160.473@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Ganymede would have security cameras, research cameras, etc,
&gt; right? So there would be a very high chance of one of these
&gt; cameras recording that it was the shadow vessel and not the White
&gt; Star, right? Right?

       Of course.  But who controls those cameras?  Answer: the very
folks who wouldn't want it to get out what they had there.

                                                                  jms
