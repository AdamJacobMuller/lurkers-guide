<pre> Mara K. Malovany &lt;102750.1414@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I wonder, does her arrogance stem solely from her own
&gt; personality, or from her position in Night Watch? So just how
&gt; scared of Night Watch is the average Earther? Or do most people
&gt; believe that Night Watch is there to protect them from treason
&gt; and invasion, nevermind if a few rights get temporarily trampled?

     Some are scared of Nightwatch, others feel it's a good thing, and
darn it, it's about time....

                                                                  jms
