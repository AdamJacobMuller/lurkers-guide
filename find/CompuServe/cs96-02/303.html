<h3>Date: 23-Feb-96 22:33:41</h3>
<pre> John M. Kahane &lt;102664.773@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is this something that explains one little gaffe that I spotted
&gt; in this episode? Oh, well,...I guess you can't catch every one,
&gt; huh?

       Not a gaffe; we flopped the shot because the writing was done
left to right, instead of right to left, which is Narnish script.

                                                                  jms
