<pre> John M. Kahane &lt;102664.773@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Why is the episode called this?
&gt; How do you intent to fig the title on the screen?

      Why's it called that?  Because it's quite appropos.  How do we
fit it? Not a big deal.  Longest title up to now was one I did for
MURDER, SHE WROTE, a quote from Moby Dick, "To The Last Shall I Grapple
With Thee."

                                                                  jms
