<pre> Michael Grabois &lt;74737.2600@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Was Hague supposed to appear in person in "Point of No Return" or
&gt; was he always going to have been behind the scenes? And did
&gt; "Severed Dreams" have to be modified to accommodate the actor's
&gt; not being there?

       Ask me again after "Severed Dreams."

                                                                  jms
