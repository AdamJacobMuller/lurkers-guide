<pre> Gerald Himmelein &lt;100417.3703@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is there homosexuality among other races which have male and
&gt; female genders defined? A related question: Are there races in the
&gt; B5 universe which have transcended male / female? And another
&gt; related question: Are there different genders in the Vorlon race?

     Yes, yes, and yes.

                                                                  jms
