<pre> John Hardin &lt;74076.22@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Re: Marcus's "surprise" for Ivanova: does Marcus not know that
&gt; Ivanova is Jewish, and thus would not eat bacon? Or does he know
&gt; that she's Jewish, and sent her the bacon 'n' eggs anyway, more
&gt; as a joke? Or does he know that she doesn't practice her religion
&gt; much, and think that she'd probably eat it anyway?

       Ivanova's not what you'd call orthodox under any circumstances.

                                                                  jms
