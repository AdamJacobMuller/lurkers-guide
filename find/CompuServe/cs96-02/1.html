<pre> Toni Muller &lt;75223.1575@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Oh, BTW, did you get a picture of a rat at a computer screen?

     Ah, is that what that was...I remember it, and was both amused
and bemused by it.

     What's fun, for me, about the Minipax lady, is that she *clearly*
knows that this is a game on one level, her comment about just
rewriting the dictionary...she knows the problems aren't *really* gone,
they just defined them away.  But when she's in front of a crowd of
folks predisposed to her message, she goes full-tilt.  Showmanship.....

                                                                  jms
