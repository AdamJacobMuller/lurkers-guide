<pre> Philip Hornsey &lt;74053.2101@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Did they change the closing credit music on Dust to Dust?

      Yes, we did change that.  Because we -- I -- forgot to have
Christopher re-score it when we were re-doing the main title.

                                                               jms
