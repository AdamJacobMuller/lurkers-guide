<pre> Chris Croughton &lt;100014.3217@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is this an attempt to keep your 'public' persona separate from
&gt; your 'personal' one, or is it something which "just happened"? How
&gt; much of the information in the book is 'canon'?

       I've always gone by Joe personally; J. Michael is just so you
can get a running start on Straczynski.

                                                                  jms
