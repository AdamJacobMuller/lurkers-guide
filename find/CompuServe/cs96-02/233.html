<pre> Daniel M. Upton &lt;75442.1331@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Does a Shadow ship have only one crewman and can the "person"
&gt; leave the ship once he has bonded with it? If it is only a two day
&gt; jump from Earth to B5 why can't they get eggs to the station
&gt; before they spoil?

       Basically, it's the cost involved in transporting something as
basically trivial as eggs.  Yes, it can be done, but the cost per egg
would be quite substantial, given limited space in ships.  Space flight
is still very expensive.

       And yes, a shadow vessel has one "core" sentient, and once in,
it's very difficult for that person to ever get out again.

                                                                  jms
