<h3>Date: 14-Feb-96 20:59:02</h3>
<pre> SysOp Dupa T Parrot &lt;70040.104@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Has there been any more discussions about the two hour
&gt; direct-to-video project?

       Nothing new.  Which is what I figured.  I think they want to
get a sense of the coming renewal situation before talks go any
further.  Which will take another month or so.  Basically, the stations
get pitched all new show pickups at NATPE, then they go home, confer
with their general managers and owners, and then decide finally which
shows they will and won't pick up. We won't hear anything definitive on
that until probably late April, possibly even early May, depending on
circumstances.

                                                                  jms
