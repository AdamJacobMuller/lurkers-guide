<pre> Nigel Nixon &lt;100666.2174@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I wonder why she left?
&gt; It would be nice, though again it depends on why she left, has
&gt; anyone had any Marianne sightings on other shows? But for how many
&gt; episodes this season?

       Marianne departed the show on her own, deciding that she wanted
to travel and do other things.  I don't think she's acted much anywhere
since.

                                                                  jms
