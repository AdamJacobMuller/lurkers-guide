<pre> Philip Hornsey &lt;74053.2101@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Are you implying that it requires divine intervention to make
&gt; studio execs see reason?

       And sometimes even divine intervention isn't enough.  By
comparison, parting the Red Sea is easy....

                                                                  jms
