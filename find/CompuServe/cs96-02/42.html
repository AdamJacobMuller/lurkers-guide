<pre> Mara K. Malovany &lt;102750.1414@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; So, do the Vorlons really worship a god named Boojie, and why
&gt; does he wear a bucket over his head?

      And best of all, the comment was sufficiently subtle that
there's no way really to censor it...it's all implication.

                                                                  jms
