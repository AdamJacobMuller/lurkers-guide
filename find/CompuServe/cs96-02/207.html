       Thanks (I think).  Yeah, I've said from the git-go that in my
view the second half of Exo isn't up to the first half.  It is, in my
view, the weakest of this season's 22.  On the flip side, that means
the other 21 are pretty nifty.

       Agree with you on Marcus.  I'm finding I have the same problem
with him I have with Londo...getting him to shut up once I wire him up
and let him go. He's a lot of fun to write, in that he can do the
physical action stuff very well, he can do comedy, more dramatic
emotional stuff...the whole range.  I can take him places and do things
with him that I can't in some ways for the other characters, in that he
has only one responsibility, whereas the others have larger
responsibilities to more people.

                                                                  jms
