     The sources of the problem are two-fold, and we keep trying to
get it straightened out.  When we deliver the episodes to WB, the sound
level is where it should be.  Then we watch the show and the levels are
a lot lower, and there's some phasing going on.  As near as we can
determine, at some point after we've turned over the episode, when
multiple levels of dubs are being made (for closed captioning, another
for national spots to be inserted, and so on), the audio goes from
digital to analog and back again. In addition, some stations tend to
clamp our audio, but run the commercials hot.  We're working to find
out where this is happening and stop it.

                                                                  jms
