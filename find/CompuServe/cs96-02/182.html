<pre>{An article compared B5 and DS9}
 Morris L. Gavant, M.D. &lt;74027.264@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Did he do that with the DS9 cover story?
&gt; Is there sour grapes underneath the essay regarding the need for
&gt; new blood?

       This is something I probably shouldn't comment upon.

                                                                  jms
