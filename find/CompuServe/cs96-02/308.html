<pre> Lynn Dimock &lt;74471.3131@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Has anybody brought up Vincent Van Gogh yet?

       It was a mild Spring day, warm, clear, sunny, when Vincent Van
Gogh picked up his easel, and some paints, and walked a mile and a half
to an open field where he often painted landscapes.  He set up his
easel, sat under a tree for a while, ate part of an apple, composed a
brief note to his brother Theo.  Then he pulled out a derringer and
shot himself in the chest.

       After an hour, realizing that he was not going to die for a
while yet, he picked himself up and staggered the mile and half back to
Theo's house, where a few hours later that evening he passed away in
Theo's arms.

       Some say his sad ending came about because he felt he was a
burden to his brother Theo, and the guilt did him in; others because he
sold only one painting during his life, for 48 francs, and he felt he
would never become a painter of any worth.

       On reflection, perhaps it was the thought of people bidding for
his ear that did it.

       You wanna see the end of this story or not...?

                                                                  jms
