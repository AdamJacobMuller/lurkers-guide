<pre> Philip Hornsey &lt;74053.2101@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Do they ever use something more *positive* on cities and the
&gt; like?

       Yes, sometimes they introduce talk shows as an instrument of
war. Any culture which begins to see talk shows can pretty much rest
assured that shadows are behind it, and that our time is growing short.

                                                                  jms
