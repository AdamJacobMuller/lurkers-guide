<pre> Deonaha M. Conlin &lt;102531.2627@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Joe, At the risk of asking a silly question, in light of the
&gt; technical explaining going on here, am I correct in assuming that
&gt; Drall is just plain a big man?

     He's a tall, stout fellow.

                                                                  jms
