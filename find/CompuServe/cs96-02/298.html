<pre> John McAuley &lt;100260.412@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Why don't you scan your ear and upload it to the graphics
&gt; library? What do you think folks, who votes for a gif/jpg of Joe's
&gt; ear?

       I think it's a terrible idea.

                                                                  jms
