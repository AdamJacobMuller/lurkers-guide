<h3>Date: 22-Feb-96 18:23:17</h3>
<pre> Daniel M. Upton &lt;75442.1331@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Should we start to look with suspicion at whoever it was that
&gt; ordered an Earth explorer ship into a sector of space in which it
&gt; would encounter the Minbari ship carrying the Grey Council --
&gt; which would respectfully approach the Earth ship with gun ports
&gt; open?

       No, that was an accident.

                                                                  jms
