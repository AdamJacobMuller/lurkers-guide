<pre> Neil Blevins &lt;102226.3566@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; What more can we do?

      It takes us no longer to make the episodes or the EFX really
than it did before.  But PTEN will not air shows out of sweeps periods,
for the most part. The episodes on hand now were finished weeks, and in
a couple of cases over a month ago.  They sit on the shelf until PTEN
decides to air them.  The only thing we did was swap "VoA" with
"Passing Through Gethsemane" to give that one a little bit more time. 
That's it.

                                                                  jms
