<pre> Tom Knudsen &lt;72347.1626@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Just as a point of reference, does it actually cost less for you
&gt; to write an episode than it does to have someone else do it? You
&gt; still get paid your writer's fee when you write the episode don't
&gt; you?

       Whether I write the episode, or a freelancer does, the fee per
episode is exactly the same.  No money is saved in the budget.  Under
WGA rules this is a requirement.

                                                                  jms
