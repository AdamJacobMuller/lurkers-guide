<pre> Chris Carrier &lt;72157.3334@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Any ideas when Season Two, especially the episodes Drazi Do
&gt; Worldcon "Geometry of Shadows" and Ivanova Meets The Libertarian
&gt; Party of 2259 "Acts of Sacrifice" will be on videotape?

       We're still working on the tapes.  We'll have info when it's
available.

       And yeah, I love the Drazi.  They're just nuts.

                                                                  jms
