       Next time you're in a bind, btw, you may want to point out to
someone out there that the *head* of the British Sci-Fi Channel, in an
interview, stated that he felt that B5 was the best SF show currently
around.  So if they want to move toward serving the UK population,
where B5 is #6 on the sell-through video charts, they definitely should
do more B5 coverage.

                                                                  jms
