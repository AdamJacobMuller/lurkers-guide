<pre> Randy Upshaw &lt;75464.1275@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; So does that mean we have 4 more episodes untill a rerun cycle
&gt; and how many of these will deal directly with the story line?

     Randy, I honestly don't think, after episodes 8-10 have aired,
that you're going to have any problems with how fast the main story is
progressing. And do bear in mind that the "main story" isn't just the
war; if you wanted to do that, you'd just do Space A&amp;B.  It's operating
on a whole lot of other levels.  Nonetheless...this entire season is
much faster overall in developing than the two before.  The first two
seasons we were mainly putting the guns into position.  Now we're
pulling all the triggers.

                                                                  jms
