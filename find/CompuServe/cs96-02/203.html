<pre> Asha DeVelder &lt;76703.4322@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; So, you're saying you didn't write that line?
&gt; That the actor just ad-libbed it and you left it in?

       Actor?  What actor?  I'm talking about Marcus here.  I just
write down what he says.

                                                                  jms
