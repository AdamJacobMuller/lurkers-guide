       Thanks.  Bruce did an excellet job in this episode, I agree. 
As did everyone else.  This is, in my opinion, about as flawless an
episode as we have ever made.  It's one of those cases where the sum is
even greater than the sum of its parts...and the sum of its parts ain't
bad.

       From here on through the next batch, the intensity level
continues to crank up.

       We definitely pushed the envelope in terms of EFX this time
out; mixing and matching, and in sheer amounts of shots, and their
complexity. But the result, I think, is eminently worth the effort.

                                                                  jms
