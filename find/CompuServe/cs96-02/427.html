<h3>Date: 29-Feb-96 22:48:05</h3>
<pre> Joel Hilke &lt;102354.1702@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Question if they are really intended as one complete story - why
&gt; weren't they labeled as such?

       We knew that at some juncture they'd be split, so numbering
them as parts 1, 2 and 3 would be awkward.  And distribution hates
having to market multi-parters, for reasons of their own.  So...three
episodes.

                                                                  jms
