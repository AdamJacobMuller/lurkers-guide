<pre> John M. Kahane &lt;102664.773@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Btw, on the subject of the Night Watch, is this the group that
&gt; has taken over the role that was formerly held by Bureau 13?

      No, the Bureau would've been a secret organization, a la the NSA
or a covert military/spy group.  This is a much more public face.

                                                                  jms
