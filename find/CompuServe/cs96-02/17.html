<pre> Raul A. Martinez &lt;102250.1006@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; No other reason is necessary, after all, how could the boss be
&gt; wrong?

     Yep, sounds about right.

     There's a reason most folks who've been involved refer to the
company as Mouschwitz.

                                                                  jms
