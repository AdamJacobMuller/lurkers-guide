<pre> Phil Adams &lt;72470.1156@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Why am I so sure you won't be surprised to hear that?
&gt; Is it as grim as "1984" and "Brazil"?
&gt; Go to a rally where a guy drives up in a BMW and talks about
&gt; Americans losing their jobs (yeah, I know he and his wife sold
&gt; off their foreign cars after this was pointed out 4 years ago,
&gt; but it was a hoot when it happened)? Go to a rally where the guy
&gt; talks about the concerns of the middle class while making
&gt; 6-figure salaries off his media work?

       For what it's worth, if your concern is with the suits, we
haven't had a single writing note from WB since episode 2 or 3 of
season 2.  Not one. Nada.  No nots at all on our cuts of the episodes. 
Nothing.  They completely trust us, and they leave us to tell our
story.

                                                                  jms
