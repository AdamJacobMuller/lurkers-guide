<H2>&lt;Rage's Thots: PoNR&gt;</H2>
<h3>Date: 29-Feb-96 22:47:54</h3>
<pre> Chad Underkoffler &lt;102512.1310@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Story idea?
&gt; Is there a name for this triptych, or would that be *telling*?
&gt; I know he's one of Harlan's faves; what about you?
&gt; And was Susan still reading Harlan's autobio in "MfE"?
&gt; Carmichael?"

       Norman's been a friend of mine long before I ever actually met
Harlan, and so yes, his name popping up was my idea.  His writing is
pretty amazing, isn't it?

       (See if your library has a copy of the audio recording of "On A
Note of Triumph;" it'll knock you down.)

                                                                  jms
