<pre> John M. Kahane &lt;102664.773@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Does this mean that the group/organization has been done away
&gt; with because of copyright problems and the like? And if the Bureau
&gt; 13 folks have been dropped, what does this do for the General
&gt; Hague conspiracy?

     No, it's just that names change; no secret group keeps the same
name for very long.

                                                                  jms
