<pre> Tom LeCompte &lt;76711.572@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Why go out of your way to help people if you can't change the
&gt; outcome? Is being a satellite of one superpower really better than
&gt; being a satellite of the other?

      You're right about the shadow war, in many senses.  The story of
B5 is the story of B5 and its people, not the shadow war, which is a
*part* of that story but not the whole of it.  (Remember, it wasn't
even mentioned in the first season.)  If it's just about a war, any
war, then something's wrong. There has to be more to it.

                                                                  jms
