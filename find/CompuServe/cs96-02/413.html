<pre> NORMAN H. JOHNSON III &lt;103707.410@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; We have seen cruisers and destroyers are those the only classes
&gt; of capitol ships or will we be seeing others, such as
&gt; battleships, in the future?

       We'll probably be seeing more and different kinds of ships as
we go in, plus support vessels of various sorts.

                                                                  jms
