<H2>Warning Bogus B5 Stuff</H2>
<h3>Date: 12-Feb-96 23:30:54</h3>
<pre>       It has come to my attention that someone at Capricon this past
weekend was trying to get fans to buy allegedly "real" B5 costume
elements for as much as $3500, attesting that he has a letter from me
verifying its origins.

       We have never released ANY costumes for sale for any reason,
and I have certainly never written any letter affirming this, or
allowing this. If this letter exists it is certainly a forgery, and
this matter should be turned over to the local police department for
investigation by their fraud and bunko divisions.  If you have had any
contact with these individuals, beware.

                                                                  jms
