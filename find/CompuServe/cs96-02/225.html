<H2>Thought from jms</H2>
<h3>Date: 18-Feb-96 15:53:20</h3>
<pre>       Here's something that occured to me today.  Any time you have
someone you're trying to convince about the quality of a show, and you
say, "Here, just watch it next week," that's always the one that comes
a-cropper.

       "Messages From Earth" airing this coming week is possibly the
best thing we've done to that point.  It's guaranteed to grab anybody
who watches it.  So this would be a good one to use.

       Pick ten friends who you know haven't yet tried B5, or are
diffident about it, and give them a call.  Tell them to give THIS one a
look.  Then all you have to do is sit back, and wait for the jaws to
drop.

                                                                  jms
