<pre> Rae Augenstein &lt;72752.1653@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; A question for you: Has anyone else ever written *all* the
&gt; scripts for a show in one season?

     No, insofar as I have been able to determine, in the history of
TV no one has ever written every episode of a season of a dramatic
series single handedly.  The closest would be Terry Nation, who wrote
the first season of Blake's 7, but that was only 13 episodes, not 22.

     As for what folks say about me...probably it's all of those you
cite, and then some.  Good and bad.  You can't work at getting a
single, personal vision on film without convincing some people you're
great, and convincing other people you're the Antichrist.

                                                                  jms
