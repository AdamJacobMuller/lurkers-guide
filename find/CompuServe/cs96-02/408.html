<pre> Julia E. Linthicum &lt;73114.3530@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; BTW, does Lady Morella's Sight work for just Centauri or
&gt; everyone? Does this guy understand what a personal vision means?

       The editorial does seem odd when you then flip to the back of
the magazine and realize that the highest marks were *consistently*
given to jms scripts.  That would appear to be a contradiction.  I
think it's also a bit unwise to question the quality of a season before
you've even *seen* it.  I suspect someone will be reconsidering those
words by the end of the season.

       Also, it wasn't like I sat down and decided to do this for my
own benefit...this season, with so much happening, the show changing so
dramatically, it's nearly impossible to bring freelancers into that. 
Next season, when the chairs have stopped moving around, that can
change and we can have other writers again.  This was necessity, not
whim.

       Elsewise...thanks for the kind comments on PoNR.

                                                                  jms
