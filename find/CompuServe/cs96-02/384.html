<pre> Daniel K. Stump &lt;104201.1460@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; In the dream sequence where Kosh and Ivonova reach Sheridan's
&gt; mind: Was Ivonova in his mind or was it all Kosh? If it was
&gt; Ivonova, then how did Gerbaldi get there or was he Kosh, as the
&gt; latter appeared as someone else in G'kar 's mind? And who was that
&gt; fourth person in dream? Are you going to leave the contradiction
&gt; about Sinclair being the last Captain of B5, as stated on the
&gt; Premiere, as is or are you going to work it out so that that
&gt; isn't a contradiction at all? Also in the premiere, wasn't
&gt; Delenn's attack on G'kar out of character?

       It was Kosh doing it all; and the narrative in the pilot never
named Sinclair specifically.

                                                                  jms
