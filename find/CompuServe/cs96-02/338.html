<pre> Michael Grabois &lt;74737.2600@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I assume she's misinformed about this?
&gt; ?

       She had to be referring to the arc overall, because if next
year's scripts are already written, I'd sure as hell like a copy of
each; it'd make my job a LOT easier.

                                                                  jms
