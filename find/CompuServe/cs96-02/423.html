<pre> Jon Wolf &lt;76103.2541@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Did somebody goose him?
&gt; Save the eye and change your fate?
&gt; Morden?
&gt; Anna?
&gt; Or will there be a time travel twist here?

     "I watched hte first month of Space A&amp;B,and I liked the grim,
gritty atmosphere.  I wish this show had more of that."

     And then we'd be just like SAAB.  I'd rather we set our own tone.
I like the jumping from humor to dark stuff...for one thing, it keeps
the audience from collectively sticking their heads in ovens across the
country. Second, a good dramatic piece can help create tension which
laughter relieves, giving you a roller-coaster effect.

                                                                  jms
