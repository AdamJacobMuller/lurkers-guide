<pre> Joe Salemi [ZD Net] &lt;72631.23@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is the arc we're in now (MFE, PONR, SD) the first or second major
&gt; turn? Harder than year three?

       Yes, the current mini-arc (8-10) is the second major turn in
the storyline.  The third starts with the last episode of this season,
going into the fourth year.  Then you've got one more big turn about
the last quarter or one-third of year four, and then a bit of a flip at
the end.

                                                                  jms
