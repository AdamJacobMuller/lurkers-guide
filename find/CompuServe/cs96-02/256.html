<h3>Date: 21-Feb-96 13:35:36</h3>
<pre> Neil Blevins &lt;102226.3566@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Will we ever find out who was the person who entered the ship,
&gt; and does it matter?

       It doesn't really matter in the long run; some poor shlub who
got conned into it.

                                                                  jms
