<pre> Antony Jackson &lt;100025.2004@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; As you know the timeslot details, I take it you would know if
&gt; they will be showing it w/s?? Also, any news on if they will be
&gt; showing it in the "hi-def" (!) PAL Plus?

       I haven't heard anything more on this, so my *suspicion* is
that the answer is no.  At this stage there probably isn't time to do
it, either.

                                                                  jms
