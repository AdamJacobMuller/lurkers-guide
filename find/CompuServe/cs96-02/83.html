<h3>Date: 07-Feb-96 22:41:20</h3>
<pre> Ray Pelzer &lt;70475.1263@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; However, after the battering and mind-rape, is LONDO still aware
&gt; that G'kar possesses this knowledge, or has it slipped into a
&gt; "must've been a nightmare" state?

      Londo knows G'Kar knows, yes.  He couldn't not know.

                                                                  jms
