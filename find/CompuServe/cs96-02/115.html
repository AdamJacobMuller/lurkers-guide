<pre> John A. Lewis &lt;76740.1520@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Could you please help me understand one aspect of VoA that I
&gt; found a bit confusing? Is one or the other behaviour simply an
&gt; *act* that this character assumes in relation to who she is
&gt; dealing with?

     Basically, like many manipulative people, she projects whatever
she thinks will work best with her audience.  Appealing to Zack's
patriotism, trying to find Sheridan's affections by flattering him
mercilessly (on many levels), playing the straight-chinned leader in an
address to security forces...she puts on whatever face she thinks will
work.

                                                                  jms
