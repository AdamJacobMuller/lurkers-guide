<pre> Tom Knudsen &lt;72347.1626@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; did he see the stuff with G'Lan)?
&gt; Are the Vorlon telepaths primarily "Dreamwalkers"?
&gt; Is that how they influence the other races?

       Yes, it helps if the person's mind is in a different state --
asleep, exhausted, in a heightened state of awareness -- for the
Vorlons to make contact, which is why their presence is often
associated with dream imagery.

                                                                  jms
