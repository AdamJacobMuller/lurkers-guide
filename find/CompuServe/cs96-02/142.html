       No, we can't contract with occasional actors in this fashion,
so we have to book them ahead of time, as soon as a script lands in the
production office.  If they're not available, sometimes we have to do
without and make the character someone else, or juggle episodes so we
can shoot when they are available.

                                                                  jms
