<pre> Celia J. Penham &lt;102454.540@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Are the episodes ever coming out on video?

       Thanks.  We hope to release the videos through the fan club
once it's seriously up on its feet.  We're booked on scripts for this
season.

                                                                  jms
