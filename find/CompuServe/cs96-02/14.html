<H2>&lt;Voices of Authority&gt;</H2>
<h3>Date: 02-Feb-96 22:57:00</h3>
<pre> Philip Hornsey &lt;74053.2101@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Why are these officers not *screaming* to *everyone they know*
&gt; that they *KNEW IT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN*!?!? Is Sheridan/Sinclair's
&gt; report what cause General Hague to become suspicious? Am I simply
&gt; wrong, and this Conspiracy of Light is simply the reaction I am
&gt; asking for?

     With Clark removing all the evidence, and others giving orders to
drop it, and knowing Clark would stop any kind of investigation, what
is there for them to do officially?  They had to begin working covertly
to prove it, which is what they've been doing ever since "Hunter,
Prey."  If you're a military officer, and you're given a direct order
from your commander in chief or the Senate Oversight Committee to drop
something, and you violate those orders, you're up on charges or fired.

                                                                  jms
