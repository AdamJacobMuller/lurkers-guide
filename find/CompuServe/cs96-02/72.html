      Ivanova wanted to get in the face of the First Ones, to say,
"Look, you can blow me away, but damn it, listen to me."  If she'd said
that "more reverently," as your friend noted, it would've worked
against the logic of the scene and the resolution.

     (Also, the political officer never "stormed into Sheridan's
office." She was waiting there, quite demurely, as he entered.  So
again, when he says that his complaint is "with Sheridan's lack of
response when the political officer stormed into his office," and that
never happened in the first place, you can understand why I might have
a problem with this.)

                                                                  jms
