<pre> Stephen C. Smith &lt;76150.1170@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Why didn't Garibaldi just remind him that Garibaldi got shot in
&gt; the back when he uncovered the conspiracy? Or was Zack not around
&gt; then and they've kept it from him because of his Nightwatch
&gt; involvment?

     You have to remember that all Garibaldi's people knew was that a
few guys came through the station that may have been involved in the
assassination. That is NOT the same thing as showing that Clark is
involved.  There was no apparent connection.  We the audience suspect
it, from what happens, but until now there has been no evidence of it. 
So yes, they know that Santiago is dead; that there's some indication
that he may have been assassinated...but that's a long way from
pointing to Clark.

                                                                  jms
