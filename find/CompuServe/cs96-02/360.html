<pre> Tom Knudsen &lt;72347.1626@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Do all the Omega class destroyer name start with Alpha or was
&gt; this just a coincidence in your post?

       Not with Alpha, since that isn't a name out of Greek mythology.
But the first one off the production line probably would've been the
Achilles.

                                                                  jms
