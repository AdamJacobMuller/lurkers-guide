<pre> JOHN GRAVES &lt;102735.1124@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; So, before I ask for a glass of whiskey, a gun, and two bullets,
&gt; please give it to me straight up: how many weeks of repeats
&gt; before we resume with new episodes?

       Just next month; we come back with new eps on April 3rd.

                                                                  jms
