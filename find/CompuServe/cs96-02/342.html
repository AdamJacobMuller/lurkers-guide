&gt; Anyone else seen anything like this, or is it just me ???

       If you could send me a copy of the catalog, I'd appreciate it. 
We have already shut down some of these companies, but others sprout up
again, offering inferior merchandise or models that fall apart fast. 
When we do models, and eventually we will, they will be *quality* and
worth fans spending hard-earned money to purchase, not cheapo
knockoffs.  (As a for instance, when we sell patches and pins via the
fan club, they will be made by the same sub-contractor who makes them
for the show, so they'll be high quality and *100% authentic*.)

                                                                  jms
