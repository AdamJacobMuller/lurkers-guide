<pre> Toni Muller &lt;75223.1575@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Was this planned or just one of those things?
&gt; Will we learn what he has written during his tenure in prison?

       Thanks.  Yes, the way Sheridan removes his EA pin here is an
echo, or a shadow, so to speak, of his moment in "Honor."  The latter
is meant to sort of indicate what might be ahead for him, what he may
have to do at some point along the line.  He has to give up things that
mean something to him. (We'll get more of this philosophy in a few more
eps, I don't want to get too specific here.)  Visual foreshadowing.

       From here on in, things get very interesting....

                                                                  jms
