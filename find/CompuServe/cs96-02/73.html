<pre> Esther Schindler [EXEC] &lt;72241.1417@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; How often do you tell someone that you write, only to have them
&gt; tell you that they've always intended to write a novel one day? as
&gt; if their intention is just as valuable as the effort you really
&gt; put into it, as the late nights spent struggling with the nasty
&gt; paragraph that refuses to sound right, as your pride in
&gt; re-reading your text and saying, "yes, that's what I wanted!"?

      Yeah, every so often, I get somebody who says, "Yeah, I could be
a writer too, if I just had the time for it."  Yes, and I could be the
Prima Ballerina of the Bolshoi if I just had the time for it.  They
don't understand that it takes *years* of training, work, isolation,
trial and error...that it's a *craft* that, like any other craft, from
woodworking to brain surgery to playing the violin, takes years to get
right.

                                                                  jms
