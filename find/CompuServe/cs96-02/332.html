<pre> Mike Hoffmann &lt;100321.2604@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Could one of the "Side of Light" (Sheridan, Sinclair, Marcus,
&gt; Ivanova, Delenn) be prepared to "pilot" a Battlecrab - and
&gt; turning it to a powerful ship for the Good Guys? Or is a
&gt; Battlecrab alive and intrinsically "evil" enough to prevent this,
&gt; just like the One Ring could not be used for Good in Lord of the
&gt; Rings, no matter how good and powerful the user was?

       It's certainly a *very* good question.

                                                                  jms
