<h3>Date: 15-Feb-96 20:58:25</h3>
<pre> Tom Knudsen &lt;72347.1626@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is the Psi Corps based on Mars, or do they only have an outpost
&gt; there? Is Bester a Mars or an Earth native?

       There's a training facility on Mars, and a somewhat classified
base. Bester was born on Earth.

                                                                  jms
