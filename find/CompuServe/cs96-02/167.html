<H2>8 NEW B5 EPS!</H2>
<h3>Date: 14-Feb-96 15:26:33</h3>
<pre> Alan Hedge &lt;72017.3232@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; You couldn't convince them to run B^2 or even AVitW?

       What, it's not enough I walked on the water here...?

       No, I wish I could say otherwise, but thus far I haven't been
able to convince them to run those eps.  Ah, well....

                                                                  jms
