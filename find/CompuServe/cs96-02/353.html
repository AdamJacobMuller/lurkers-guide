<pre> Joel Hilke &lt;102354.1702@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; That's good honor - but can it hold?
&gt; Do you see my issues on this thing?
&gt; Oh, btw - I assume the Whitestar is the only ship that's been
&gt; able to achieve an in-atmosphere jump? Its been tried before with
&gt; disastrous results ala opening jumppoints in jumpgates?

       Of course it can't hold.  And they're going to go through
plenty of fire.  Remember, this is the first of three that accomplish
that.  Each escalates upon what went before.  Don't worry...you'll get
your wish.

                                                                  jms
