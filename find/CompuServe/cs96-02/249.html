<pre> Michael Zitaglio &lt;102545.641@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Were the Shakespearian lines in Exogenesis your doing or Jason
&gt; Carter's? Or did you write them specifically with him in mind?

       I like Marcus quoting literature, Shakespeare included.  So
it's something I've peppered through his character, though trying to
avoid too much of it.

                                                                  jms
