<pre> Mara K. Malovany &lt;102750.1414@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Where did G'Kar take Londo?
&gt; Was it meant to be inarticulate, or am I missing something?

       Thanks.  Emotion, for me, is the key to all drama.  If it
doesn't make you feel something, what's the point?  The writer's job is
to touch passion, not be burned by it, and come back to tell what it
was like.

       And what G'Kar said was, "Dear G'Quon, no more...."

                                                                  jms
