<pre> Draco &lt;101603.2062@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; a) In the Narn/Shadows battle, a Shadow ship is damaged by a
&gt; combined Narn attack - The Shadow ship seems to be totally
&gt; immobilised, was it really this badly hurt that the loss of one
&gt; part of one of it's 20 'limbs' (yes I've counted them!) causes
&gt; this ? - how tough are they ?
&gt; b) Is it possible that the bit of 'limb' is still floating in
&gt; orbit ? - for someone to collect and analyze?
&gt; - or can the Vorlons just tell us everything about Shadow tech ?

       It was in shock, but it would've recovered in a bit more time.

                                                                  jms
