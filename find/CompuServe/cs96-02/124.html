<pre> Burhaan Ahmad &lt;75754.3065@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Why not sooner?
&gt; Perhaps he needed to suffer into truth?

       Because G'Kar needed to hit bottom, real bottom, before he
would be receptive to the message...because time doesn't mean to the
vorlons what it means to us...and because he was finally mentally
receptive due to the dust.

                                                                  jms
