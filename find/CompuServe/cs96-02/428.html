<pre> Joe Salemi [ZD Net] &lt;72631.23@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I loved Londo's throw-away line about politicians and
&gt; intelligence -- did you sit at your keyboard and cackle to
&gt; yourself when you wrote it?

       Thanks, and I agree with those scenes.  (For me, the Vir/Londo
scene in the tag is just hysterical.)  Re: "politics has nothing to do
with intelligence," yeah, I kinda liked that one.  I have fun....

                                                                  jms
