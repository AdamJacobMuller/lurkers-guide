<pre> Michael E. MacDonal &lt;102371.1166@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; And also will we ever see Iron heart again ...?
&gt; ?

       Talia's gift was exactly what was indicated, nothing much
hidden in there: greater capacity to shield her thoughts, and limited
telekinesis.

       No plans for Ironheart for long, long time.

       We shoot episodes from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. daily.  Rarely do we go
overtime.

                                                                  jms
