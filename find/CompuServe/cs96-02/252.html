       Okay, then if gravities is inappropriate, 'splain to how
shuttle and jet pilots refer to gravities in similar situations, e.g.,
pulling 2 g's when at a certain accelleration and turn pattern.

       Also, when the Galilleo probe was inserted into the Jovian
atmosphere, and a number of scientists on CSPAN were talking about
Jupiter, they commented that the interior of Jupiter would be twice (or
whatever number) the gravity of Earth.

       You're dealing with a much greater *mass* than with Earth, and
thus greater gravity.  I don't see where in here is the flaw.

                                                                  jms
