<pre> Daniel M. Upton &lt;75442.1331@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; So how come they can get away with it?
&gt; I know that you wont sue them, but *if* you did would they have
&gt; any kind of defense?

       I dunno...still, I prefer to do what I do in the marketplace of
free ideas.  There's how we did it, and how they did it.  Let the
viewer take it from there.

                                                                  jms
