<H2>&lt;Point of No Return&gt;</H2>
<h3>Date: 29-Feb-96 15:11:10</h3>
<pre> Philip Hornsey &lt;74053.2101@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Can the President dissolve the Senate, as Parliments may
&gt; sometimes be dissolved, prompting new elections? What is the
&gt; procedure for removing the President from office? Can the
&gt; President declare Martial Law over the entire nation without the
&gt; consent of the Senate? Can the President suspend the Constitution?
&gt; HOW IN *GOD'S NAME* CAN THE MILITARY SUPPORT THIS!?!?!?

       Wait for the next episode, then we'll see.

                                                                  jms
