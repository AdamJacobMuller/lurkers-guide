<pre> John M. Kahane &lt;102664.773@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Whne it gets to be this bad, what do you do for it, short of not
&gt; typing on the keyboard for two days? Have you considered the
&gt; surgery for this condition? In the meantime, take care of
&gt; yourself, okay?

       Actually, no, the plan next season is not to write all of them;
it only happened this season because so much gets changed that it's
hard to bring in freelancers.  Next season, things will have stabalized
enough to bring in freelancers again.

                                                                  jms
