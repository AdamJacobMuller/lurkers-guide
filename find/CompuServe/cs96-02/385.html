<pre> Deon W. Becic &lt;102147.3271@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; My question: Is there a possibility that you could publish your
&gt; collection of complete, uncut scripts?

       We may sell some scripts via the fan club, plus the one in the
writing book.  We'll see....

                                                                  jms
