<pre> John M. Hawkins &lt;71742.160@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; You've read some history?

       Yeah, there are a lot of historical parallels in here, more in
tonality than specifics in some cases like these.  When things get
tight, even good people sometimes don't know which way to jump.

                                                                  jms
