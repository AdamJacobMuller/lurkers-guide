<pre> Automedia, Inc. &lt;70530.2521@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I know you can't tell me what they will become (if anything), but
&gt; can you let me sleep nights by letting me know you won't just
&gt; forget about their relationship?

       I would say it's fair to say I do plan to do more with that
relationship as we get deeper into the story.  And thanks.

                                                                  jms
