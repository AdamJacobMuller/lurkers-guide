<pre> Daniel K. Stump &lt;104201.1460@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Have you discussed DAYPRO with your doctor?
&gt; TALIA: if she is "The future" then why is she off the show?
&gt; Did the Actress quit or is this all part of the grand scheme of
&gt; things? Kosh: What does "You have always been here" mean anyway?
&gt; Stephen Furst is still on the opening squence, so is Vir going to
&gt; be on as much as ever? Here's a joke I made up, you're welcome to
&gt; use it if you like, no credit nor compensation required: How many
&gt; Vorlons does it take to screw in a light bulb?

       "If Talia is 'the future' then why is she off the show?"

       Because stuff happens.  Because rocketry was the hope of the
German Luftwaffe to win the war.  Didn't work out that way.  Just
because a character says it, doesn't mean that it's guaranteed to
happen at all times. A parent can look at a child and say, "He's our
hope for the future," and the next day the kid gets turfed by a
semi-truck.  Stuff happens.  Nothing is guaranteed in the B5 universe;
any character -- ANY character -- is vulnerable.  That, for me, is part
of what's exciting.

       Vir is in this season about as much as last, yes.

                                                                  jms
