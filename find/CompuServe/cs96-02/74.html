<pre> Esther Schindler [EXEC] &lt;72241.1417@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Or is this a guy thing?

      Her feeling was likely that it has always worked with her in the
past. He's widowed, probably hasn't had any in a long time, he's
vulnerable, a perfect target.

                                                                  jms
