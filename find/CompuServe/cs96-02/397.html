<pre> TIMOTHY R. GREEN &lt;73023.143@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Since you originally set up the 5 year story-line, has the
&gt; performance of the actors involved enthralled you to the point of
&gt; changing a character's fate? How do you handle this kind of thing
&gt; when you want to stay true to the story, but see the rewards of
&gt; an actor's performance perhaps drawing more viewers? Or just being
&gt; darned good entertainment?

       My feeling is that if you've got a great actor, and you love
the character, you don't refrain from doing something Awful to
them...if anything it makes it better, 'cause you'll care about it
more.

                                                                  jms
