<pre> Bernard F. Dowdy, J &lt;76550.347@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Do you have any advice on effective strategies for dealing with
&gt; station management?

       The best techniques are always persistence, and organization;
if you can get others involved as well, in a concerted effort, that
always has an effect.

                                                                  jms
