<h3>Date: 29-Feb-96 19:12:38</h3>
<pre> Bernard F. Dowdy, J &lt;76550.347@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Do you have any ideas on what would be strong enough and to the
&gt; point without offending the station manager? Could I obtain a
&gt; copy?

       Problem is, if I get in any way involved in advising on this
stuff, it makes it look like I'm behind it, which negates the impact. 
Your best option is to just indicate the demographics of those you've
got on (their ages/status), and to be polite, and positive.

                                                                  jms
