<pre> John Hardin &lt;74076.22@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; So what about the telepath in Sinclair's squad during the Battle
&gt; of the Line? Was he a closet "teep"?
&gt; or was EA desparate for any pilot?
&gt; or is this just some propaganda on Psi-Corps part??
&gt; Say, what was that stat about teeps and teeks?
&gt; What do we call Talia's husband?
&gt; eep??
&gt; eek??
&gt; Finally, how high do the P-ratings go?
&gt; P-5 Commercial telepath (Lyta?) P-10 Instructors P-13 Psi-cops
&gt; P-?? will we ever see her at her full potential?) P-??

      As I recall, it was mentioned that he was a closet teep.
