<pre> Gerard Keating (Ireland) &lt;71154.3423@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Cound the unused "premises" be used as a basis for novels or
&gt; comics ???

       One of them was; David Gerrold's premise was used for the
two-part comic he wrote.  But beyond that, separated rights means that
the author holds onto ancillary uses, so I can't go around assigning
their outlines or premises for books and the like, only my own.

                                                                  jms
