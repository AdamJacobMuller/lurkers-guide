<pre> John R. Finnan (Ireland) &lt;100012.3073@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is that a B5 episode, or a DS9?

       Yeah, given that our script was floating around for months
before this was shot, and Foxworth had *already agreed* to do our
episode, and his agent, and they brushed us off to do the DS9....

                                                                  jms
