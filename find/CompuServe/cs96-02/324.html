&gt; Vorlon Cruiser, Narn Transport, Raider Ship #3 Centauri
&gt; Transport, Minbari Cruiser, Star Fury #4 Minbari Flyer, Narn
&gt; Fighter, Babylon 5 Crew Shuttle #5 ?, ?, ? #6 ?, ?, ?

       Also, T-shirts are currently available from All-U as well, very
good quality stuff.  Ruby's is doing some B5 masks which are fairly
decent.  And there's the Making of B5 book coming out in about a month
in the UK from Boxtree Books, by David Bassom.  (I'm currently
fact-checking his second B5 book, the A-Z of Babylon 5.)
