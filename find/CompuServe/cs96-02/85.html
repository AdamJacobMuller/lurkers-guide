<pre>{original post had no questions}

      She didn't say that she was from the "B5 advisory council."  She
said that she had been dispatched by the Senate Oversight Committee,
which as we have established before, has jurisdiction in many ways over
B5.

      This is the difference between TV logic and Real logic.  In TV
logic, yeah, she should've tossed her outta there...but we try to be
rigorously real about the B5 universe.  She was sent by the Senate
Oversight Committee, as is their province, with the backing of several
governmental offices, in an area over which Sheridan doesn't have
jusrisdiction: the political arena back home. In the real world, you
can't just toss somebody out the door because you don't like them...not
if you're a career military officer who answers to a civilian authority
or government.

                                                                  jms
