<pre>       Having taken steps to further help promote the show, there's a
lot more happening.  If you're in Portland tonight watch "Good Evening"
tonight at 7:30 p.m. on KGW and in Seattle on "Evening" on KING-TV for
a piece on "Point of No Return."  Also, tomorrow's Showbiz Minute on
CNN will do stuff on this episode as well.

       EXTRA will be running clips this weekend, and the AP has a
story on it, as well as the New York Times Syndicate Inside-Trek
column.  The episode has been picked as a highlight in the Philadelphia
press, the LA Times, and in major newspapers in Dallas, Houston,
Chicago, San Francisco, New York and elsewhere.

       Slowly, we're getting noticed.

                                                                  jms
