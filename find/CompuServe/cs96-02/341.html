<pre> Brian A. Thomas &lt;75231.1122@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; When the official fan club gets up and running, will information
&gt; be included how to get in contact with all these people to get
&gt; their products, or will the club make it available itself?

       The theory is that we'll use the fan club web page to allow
direct or indirect access to the folks who make all the other
non-fan-club licensed stuff.  We may even have a kind of virtual Zocalo
where you can shop....

                                                                  jms
