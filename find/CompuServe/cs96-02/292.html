<pre> Jonathan Hoopingarn &lt;73172.1065@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Will we see more First Ones in upcoming episodes?
&gt; Will we find out what these First Ones have against the Vorlons?
&gt; Will we see more of Susan using the Great Machine, will her
&gt; experience (other than finding First Ones) become a factor in the
&gt; Great War, and will those experiences color her perceptions and
&gt; attitudes? On a general Ivanova note: Will any more come out about
&gt; her relationship (if any) with Talia and will that affect any
&gt; relationship with Marcus ?

       I think the answers to all of those tend to be yes....

                                                                  jms
