<pre> Daniel M. Upton &lt;75442.1331@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; What sense do you get from the letters of when the average
&gt; non-netted person comes to realize that the whole series is
&gt; telling one specific story?

       What I usually get are letters that say, "I didn't know there
was an arc until I saw four or five episodes."  Because that's an
aspect that really hasn't been as well promoted as it could've been. 
But once they glommed onto it, they ran with it.

                                                                  jms
