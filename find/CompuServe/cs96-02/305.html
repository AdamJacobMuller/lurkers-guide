<pre> John M. Kahane &lt;102664.773@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Stabilized, huh?
&gt; Does this mean that you'll be looking for a script editor once
&gt; more? I seem to recall that Larry DiTillio left the series, so
&gt; that would mean that you'd be taking over the script editing as
&gt; well, right?

       During Larry's last year with us, I did most of the rewriting
on freelance scripts anyway, so it doesn't really save me much on
typing.  (If anything, the process is longer and more difficult than
just writing 'em myself.)  Doing it this year was an interesting
experiment, and necessary, but I don't think I'd opt to do it again
anytime soon.

                                                                  jms
