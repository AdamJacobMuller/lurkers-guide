<pre> Daniel M. Upton &lt;75442.1331@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; When did Londo acquire his taste for them?
&gt; Perhaps when he came into possession of 20,000 shares in a spoo
&gt; ranch? Did she ever prophecy for Turhan?
&gt; Did Sheridan sucker him into trapping the NW or did Zack
&gt; knowingly help Sheridan? Hague's squadron mean that Franklin's
&gt; father is on Clark's side?

       Thanks.  I think Zack was mainly nervous in that last bit,
which may account for his twitchiness.  And yes, Morella often
prophesied for Turhan.

                                                                  jms
