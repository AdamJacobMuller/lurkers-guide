<pre> Anne L. Warner &lt;71513.1177@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Were the Drazi spokesperson in Dust to Dust, the Green Drazi
&gt; Leader in Geometry of Shadows, and the Markab ambassador in
&gt; Confessions and Lamentations, all the same actor? Who is he?
&gt; So I'm curious as to whether I'm right that these are all the
&gt; same actor, and if so, who???

       I'm pretty sure he was both Drazis, but I'm not certain offhand
about the Markab.

                                                                  jms
