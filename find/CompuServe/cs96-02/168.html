       Actually, they did use that kind of technique on some of their
own population.  The medical population, for instance.  Recently
uncovered (and shown on A&amp;E, which I sometimes think is the All Nazi
Network, All Nazis, All the Time) were a series of "informational
films" produced during the war and shown to doctors charged with the
notion of eliminating the insane, the genetically flawed, and others
not classified as jews or gypsies or poles or other non-desirable
races.

       They went through, each film gradually stating their theory
more clearly, and explained that these poor souls weren't *really*
alive, weren't *really* aware.  It systematically showed how it was
better, really, in the lokng run, to put them out of their own, and
society's, misery.

       If it ever comes around again, watch it; it'll chill your soul.
