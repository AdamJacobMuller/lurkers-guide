<H2>Age of Centauri?</H2>

       Probably about 120 would be the oldest a human would get; there
hasn't been that much change in that end of it.  The median age,
though, is different, so that right now, the average lifespan is 68
years, I think.  By 2260 you can add another 20 years to that.

                                                                  jms
