<pre> Don Fort &lt;72204.1356@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is there any chance we'll see what Catherine Sakai was doing at
&gt; Sigma 957 a season or so ago?

       Sakai was doing just what she said she was doing, checking out
the area for mining and other exploitation.

                                                                  jms
