<pre> Nigel Nixon &lt;100666.2174@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Don't you ever get really fed-up that B5 gets so much coverage in
&gt; the UK SF press (two big articles in SFX plus those awards, one
&gt; or two features a month in TV Zone, a feature every month or two
&gt; in Starburst) while at home you seem almost ignored?

       It's annoying in terms of the US press, but it reaffirms the
taste, selectivity and discretion of the British audience....

                                                                  jms
