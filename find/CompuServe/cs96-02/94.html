<pre> Kevin P. Kenney &lt;104102.352@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Anyone got any year two examples?
&gt; Demure?

     Two comments, and two only.

     He's still wrong.  She was waiting, demurely, when Sheridan
entered. The argument didn't start until well afterward.  Tell him to
run the episode again and maybe LOOK at it this time.

     Second comment...I suspect that Hank has a problem with women. 
His concerns repeatedly are with the women characters, that they're too
much in your face, that they're not reverential enough, that they're
"pushy," doesn't like that they can be sexually aggressive.

     In short...the problem may not be the show....

                                                                  jms
