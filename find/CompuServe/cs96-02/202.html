<pre> mitoch &lt;103576.3032@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Hi, I just have to ask ( and I don't think a spoiler is
&gt; necessary), but is the voice of the pilot on the shuttle Dyson
&gt; actually Sean Connery or is it a celebrity impersonator?

       It was a voice in the walla group that basically came out
sounding that way.

                                                                  jms
