<H2>Q. "Time On Target!"?</H2>
<h3>Date: 06-Feb-96 16:43:55</h3>
<pre> Roger Stenning &lt;101521.1646@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Just what does "Time on target" mean?
&gt; Help, anyone?

     You fire your weapons (missiles, other stuff) not necessarily at
the same moment, but so that it all *hits* at the same time.  Time is a
factor for the arrival at the target.  Hence, time on target.

                                                                  jms
