<pre> Alan P. Biddle &lt;73260.1450@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Since you like at least parts of THE SHINING, I was wondering if
&gt; he is writing the Narnish equivalent of "The quick brown fox
&gt; jumped over the lazy dog" over and over and over?

       No, I don't think I'd go that way with him, certainly not
yet....

                                                                  jms
