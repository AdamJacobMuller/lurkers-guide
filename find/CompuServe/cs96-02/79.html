<pre> John M. Kahane &lt;102664.773@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Do you have something against the ambassadorial aides or what
&gt; this year? Perhaps we'll learn more about this in a future
&gt; episode?

      The female Psi Cop here *was* the same as in ARTDP, played by
Judy Levitt, who is also Walter's wife.

      Yeah, everyone turned in great performances in this one, very
intense and layered.  And as a result of G'Kar's attack, the next
several episodes will find him still in prison.  In the B5 universe,
you don't just go in for a long time at the end of an ep and next thing
you're out again.  He has to serve his time, and now we'll see him in a
cell for a while.

      And yes, you'll learn more about what happened to the Narn
telepaths in coming months.

                                                                  jms
