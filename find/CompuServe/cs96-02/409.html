<pre> Ray Pelzer &lt;70475.1263@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Hm, at the risk of sounding very silly, might I suggest you
&gt; consider doing an on-camera intro to the final episode of Season
&gt; 5?

       Yeah, that'll *really* bring up the ratings....

       "The next sound you hear will be millions of remote controls
flipping to another channel all at once...."
