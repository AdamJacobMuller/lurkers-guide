<pre> Julia E. Linthicum &lt;73114.3530@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; WHY do you do this to us?

       If you think this is bad, wait until after next week's episode,
when you'll have to wait until April 3rd for the conclusion of the
three-episode mini-arc.

                                                                  jms
