<H2>New to Babylon 5</H2>
<h3>Date: 03-Feb-96 21:16:15</h3>
<pre> John McAuley &lt;100260.412@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Why did he bother with Londo?
&gt; What if Londo had caused a scene and "Varner" got detained by
&gt; security? Did someone else, with another changeling net, try to
&gt; kill Kosh? Was Lyta's mental vision faked by Kosh?
&gt; Will we find out in the very last episode of B5?

      Actually, it was stated in the pilot that the assassin gave
Londo a line of credit (later canceled) which Londo used to continue
gambling, not that he personally stayed there the whole time.

                                                                  jms
