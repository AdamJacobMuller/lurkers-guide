<pre> Randy Hall &lt;74617.420@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Don't you know better than to try and say something good about a
&gt; Trek show in the B5 area?

     "Don't you know better than to try and say something good about a
Trek show in the B5 area?  I'm surprised JMS didn't come flying in here
accusing you of having a sinister agenda and trying to do him personal
harm."

     An interesting comment from you, given that you're addressing
this to Wayne Hall, your brother, so obviously he came in here to leave
the message so you could then respond in this fashion, and thus attack
me.

     Also intresting in light of your comments on AOL, in which you
were the single loudest voice screaming bloody murder whenever B5 was
mentioned in the ST areas, and your repeated request, verging on
demand, that people be prohibited from mentioning B5 at ST conventions,
bitching about the mention of B5 at ST panels, and generally carrying
on cranky whenever the show got any mention at all in a ST folder.

     Whereas, on the other hand, when the B5 page was opened on AOL, I
made it a *point* to make sure that there was a subsidiary section set
aside for the discussion of other TV series, including the variations
of ST, to create a more open environment.

     The problem, as usual with you, Randy, is entirely yours.  You
continue to project onto others your own problems.  You're truly a
pathetic individual.

                                                                  jms
