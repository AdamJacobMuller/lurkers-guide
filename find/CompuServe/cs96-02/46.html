<H2>&lt;&lt;B5 - WWII Parallel&gt;&gt;</H2>
<h3>Date: 05-Feb-96 12:01:26</h3>
<pre> Philip Hornsey &lt;74053.2101@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Can PsiCorps members belong to Nightwatch?
&gt; Where did they do their recruiting for Nightwatch?
&gt; Are they the SS to HomeGuard's SA?
&gt; Do they have arrest powers, and are these "thoughtcrimes" that
&gt; they investigate *officially* illegal, or do they have to trump
&gt; up a sedition charge? What is President Clark's first name (I have
&gt; heard William on ANFAW, and Morgan elsewhere, including Clark's
&gt; Law)? Where did he get this *extreme* personal *hatred* for Luis
&gt; Santiago?

     It's William Morgan Clark.

     And yes, they have some powers of arrest.

                                                                  jms
