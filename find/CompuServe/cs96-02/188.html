<pre> Marte Brengle &lt;76703.4242@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Gee, then it'll be what, ten years before the WB stores start
&gt; selling B5 merchandise?

       Yes, I know the store...I've spent far too much money there,
mostly on Superman stuff.  (You know you've spent too much money at the
WB store when the clerks actually *call you* to tell you that something
just came in that you're gonna NEED to buy.  I sometimes think I have
the word STOOGE tattooed upon my forehead....)

                                                                  jms
