<H2>Last Shadow War</H2>
<h3>Date: 14-Feb-96 20:58:50</h3>
<pre> Rowan Kaiser &lt;74160.473@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Was Earth involved?
&gt; Were there Shadow bases on Earth, like on the Narn homeworld, or
&gt; was it something else? When was the last was?
&gt; We know it was 1000 years ago, is that approximate, or the exact
&gt; date? Will you answer all of these questions straight and to the
&gt; point?

       You'll get some of the answers here in next week's episode. 
The rest will be handled by the end of the season.

                                                                  jms
