       Also, bear in mind that Sheridan went into Earth-space knowing
the risks.  For him to fire on the Aggy would be selfish, and wrong; he
knew full well that this could be a one-way ride.

       If you're going to have a situation where Sheridan fires on EA
ships, it has to be the ONLY way of dealing with the situation, and it
has to be SUPREMELY motivated, so that it's not just him or one of our
guys who's at stake.  It has to be a big situation to merit taking the
lives of fellow officers, in the same service.

                                                                  jms
