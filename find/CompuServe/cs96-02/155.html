<pre> Philip Hornsey &lt;74053.2101@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; So, how come it looks like *the're right*?
&gt; Am I off base here?
&gt; Would Earthdome and Psi Corps interpret that incident
&gt; differently?

       Some might, others might not.  Simple fact is, the rules of the
Psi Corps would forbid them from engaging ANY human telepath for this
purpose. So the only other recourse is non-humans.

                                                                  jms
