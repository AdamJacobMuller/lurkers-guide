<pre> Randy Upshaw &lt;75464.1275@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Perhaps you and everyone else are correct and I am so invloved in
&gt; this story that I can't wait (which is the case)? Are we going to
&gt; see these before another rerun cycle? Are B5's ratings in an area
&gt; that are going to support a 5 year run?

     We'll see 8 and 9 in this current cycle, yes.  #10 will be aired
in the next batch, in late April/first of May.

                                                                  jms
