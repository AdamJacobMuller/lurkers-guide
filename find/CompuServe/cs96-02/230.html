       If you're looking for rationality here, save your time; these
are the same two, he and his brother, who *insisted* over on AOL that I
had sent official B5 reps to conventions to bash ST...and when
challenged, backpedaled fast...until finally admitting that they saw a
couple of guys on a panel who'd said bad things about ST, but were in
NO way associated with B5 in ANY official capacity whatsoever.  They
basically just made it up.

       He just posted a HUGE and *provable* fabrication about DS9's
ratings over on the ST section, and then has the audacity to come here
and say that *I* speak with a forked tongue.

       They seem to think that somehow I should prevent B5 fans from
ever saying anything derogatory about ST.  I don't have that kind of
control. They said it here again, that I "allow" this behavior.  This
is irrational thinking at its finest, that somehow I control or allow
viewers of this or any show to do or say ANYthing.  Their attitude is
like a cranky child, "Make 'em stop talking bad about our show!"

       Basically, accuracy and the Halls dine at separate tables. 
You're making the same mistake I did at first with the Halls...assuming
that you were dealing with sensible individuals interested in the
facts.  You're not, and they're not.

                                                                  jms
