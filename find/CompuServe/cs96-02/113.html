<pre> Rick Sharon &lt;76416.2213@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Am I the &lt;not so&gt; silent majority?
&gt; Like major stuff hasn't happened yet??
&gt; So many subtle things we so easily miss, which are significant,
&gt; which are not? Is ANYthing insignificant?
&gt; re: dumbing down of B5?
&gt; Frustrating?
&gt; Do I wish I knew what was coming?
&gt; What the final end would be?
&gt; Where you are taking us?

     Thanks.  I really think this season is just overall such a leap
over the previous season, especially once episodes 8-10 hit.  As it
happens, I showed a bit from 8 to some folks in the office the other
day, one in particular being a fan of the show who sat in on an
interview...to say their jaws were on the floor doesn't *begin* to
describe it.

                                                                  jms
