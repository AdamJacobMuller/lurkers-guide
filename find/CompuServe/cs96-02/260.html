<pre> John M. Kahane &lt;102664.773@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Who'd have thought that the man called "Starkiller" last year
&gt; would be walking down the hallway of a Minbar (and half-Vorlon)
&gt; ship with two Minbari, huh? What can one say about this poor guy,
&gt; who is literally about to be caught between a rock and a hard
&gt; place?

       Thanks.  Actually, we crank up the whole Nightwatch story over
the next two episodes, and what's happening with Earth, until it hits
fever pitch. Things really start to move.  (There's almost a short lull
after #10, just to let folks catch their breath a bit before the next
big wave.)

                                                                  jms
