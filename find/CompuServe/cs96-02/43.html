<pre> Thomas M. Conlon &lt;73544.321@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Has anyone else noticed the similarity between the Shadow Wars
&gt; and WWII? Remember the Secret Police?
&gt; Anyone care to put in their 2 cent's worth?

     While yes, there are some intentional WW II parallels here, do
bear in mind that you don't have to go all the way back to the Gestapo
to find this kind of mentality...Sen. McCarthy would've been quite at
home in Nightwatch.
