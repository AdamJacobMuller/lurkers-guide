<H2>Sheridan/Sinclair JPG</H2>
<h3>Date: 14-Feb-96 17:11:03</h3>
<pre>I've just uploaded to library 5 the first JPG of Sheridan and Sinclair
together from the 2-parter "War Without End."  The file name is
twob5.jpg, and will be available as soon as it's cleared.  It's a
little dark, so it may take some work to get a real strong image.

                                                                  jms
