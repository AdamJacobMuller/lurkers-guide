       I agree.  We're slowly ratcheting up the tension, and this has
got to take a toll on people.  Franklin probably wouldn't be doing as
many stims as he is otherwise.  Actions have consequences.

       And yes, having seen prior episodes adds more texture.  Still,
one can follow the episode for what it is.  The more you watch, the
more you get out of it.

                                                                  jms
