<h3>Date: 17-Feb-96 15:06:58</h3>
<pre> Rae Augenstein &lt;72752.1653@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Where is the ISN during all this Nightwatch stuff?
&gt; Why aren't they investigating the Nightwatch?
&gt; Is the press being supressed by the MiniPax?
&gt; Will this become a factor in an upcoming episode?
&gt; Will Universe Today become a propaganda arm of Earth Dome?

       You'll find more on this in the next three episodes.

                                                                  jms
