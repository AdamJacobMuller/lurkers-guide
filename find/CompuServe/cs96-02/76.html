<pre> Neil Blevins &lt;102226.3566@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I guess I'm so used to sinister motives that I can't tell if Kosh
&gt; is still manipulating, or is he sincere?

      A person can be sincere and still manipulative, in Kosh's case. 
If he believes he's right, perhaps he's willing to manipulate anyone
toward that goal, if it's worth it.

                                                                  jms
