<pre> David DeRubeis &lt;75221.2351@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; How does that work?
&gt; Do the stations order the show, and then if there are enough
&gt; orders Warner renews the series?

     Correct.  There's a certain number of stations you have to have
to make the syndication deal work financially.  You get that number,
you get the pickup; you don't, you don't.

                                                                  jms
