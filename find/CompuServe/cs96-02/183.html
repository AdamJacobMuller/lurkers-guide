<pre> Rae Augenstein &lt;72752.1653@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Do you know why the image is so dark?

       I have no idea, as we didn't provide the graphic; I can only
assume they either got it from WB, or digitized it themselves off the
raw footage.

                                                                  jms

       (PS, I did upload a cleaner, slightly lighter version an hour
or two later.)
