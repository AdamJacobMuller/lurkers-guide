<pre> Ray Pelzer &lt;70475.1263@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; have you called Guiness yet?

       Nope, not calling anybody until I've actually *done* it, and
there's still one more to go.  One doesn't mention the term "perfect
game" while the pitcher is still on the mound in the 9th.

                                                                  jms
