<h3>Date: 16-Feb-96 22:17:41</h3>
<pre> Christopher R. Turn &lt;71470.1536@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is there any chance (pretty please!) that the unused scripts from
&gt; seasons one and two (such as *The Long Night of Susan Ivanova*)
&gt; might be released?

       There *are* no unused scripts.  This is a misnomer.  I've had a
few titles, or premises, that haven't gone as far as a script, but no
abandoned scripts.  So I can't upload them, since they don't exist.

                                                                  jms
