<pre> Neil Blevins &lt;102226.3566@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Was he digitally added at any point in that episode?

     We shot two plates, first with him in the machine, then him out,
never moving the camera, so it matched exactly.

                                                                  jms
