<pre> Philip Hornsey &lt;74053.2101@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Should I not be?
&gt; How do you do business when you suddenly live in a dictatorship
&gt; and you use to be a democracy?

       Thanks.  No, I understand the point, I'm just getting into the
details a bit.  One last point I forgot to mention was that even for
the US, there has never yet been a situation where we as an entire
*species* stood on the brink of extinction by an alien race.  That'll
definitely affect your mindset a bit....

                                                                  jms
