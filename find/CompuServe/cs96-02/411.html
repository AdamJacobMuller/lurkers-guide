<pre> Suzanne l. Bainbrid &lt;103307.2600@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; How on earth are you going to be able to maintain this quality
&gt; for another 2 1/2 seasons, &lt;eg&gt; and still keep your sanity, not
&gt; to mention your budgets?

       Thanks...and we just have to keep making it constantly better,
there's no going back now.

                                                                  jms
