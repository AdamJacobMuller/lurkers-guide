<pre> John MacVeigh &lt;72467.2141@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; The question is: do G'Kar (and Morden) still have free will?

      Actually, I tend to agree with that assessment.  They've guided
and instructed and pointed, yes...and manipulated...but they still
haven't had to step up to the plate in other areas.

      And I don't think the Narns have sacrificed nearly enough yet. 
You can always sacrifice more.

                                                                  jms
