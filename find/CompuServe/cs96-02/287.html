<h3>Date: 22-Feb-96 22:37:39</h3>
<pre>       A labor action leading to a strike, with people shouting
"strike!" and "union!" hits aboard a space station, inspired in part by
a person of Irish descent whose ancestor was killed in the course of a
famous strike. A government rep arrives to quash the strike, stating
that he will use "any means necessary" toward that goal, which is
finally achieved when the person in the middle redistributes his
finances, giving the strikers what they want while circumventing the
system.

       Quick...is that a DS9 episode or a B5 episode?

                                                                  jms
