     "...didn't seem to announce her authority well enough...the
Babylon 5 Advisory Council...."

      Once again, as I noted elsewhere, this is NOT what she said, she
specifically noted that this was from the Earth SENATE.  How much does
one need to explain the senate?  (Jokes aside.)  As it was, that scene
went about 2 full minutes of carefully balanced exposition...more, to
explain the senate, when we've been seeing senators all three years is
silly.  It WAS announced well enough.

     One simply has to pay attention.  Thus far, the "better ways"
have struck out consistently.  Most have been based on totally
incorrect perceptions of what was said or done in the episode; the
others are matters of personal taste that are, frankly, just lateral
moves.  Most, again, are simply from not paying attention.

     There's a great story about the first time Van Gogh met Gaugain,
his role model.  Gaugain looked at Vah Gogh's paintings, which had been
hung on all the walls for his inspection, and after a moment announced,
"You paint too fast."

     To which Van Gogh replied, "No, you LOOK too fast."

     Take the lesson for what it's worth.

                                                                  jms
