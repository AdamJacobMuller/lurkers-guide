     Thanks.  Yes, I think we've cast some great actors in the show,
and they only continue to improve.

     Many of us on the show are fans of fighter planes and military
history, especially producer John Copeland.  So we've taken to giving
the Starfuries nose art...in fact, the near-legendary WW II flying
squadron the Flying Tigers actually gave us *permission* to use their
logos on Sheridan's fighter.

                                                                  jms
