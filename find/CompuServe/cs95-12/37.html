<h3>Section: Babylon 5: Upcoming<br>Date: December 04, 1995 2:10:22 AM</h3>
<pre>      There are templates used, with some variations.  In a government
monitored  situation (which this wasn't, they thought he was dead),
mindwipes are kept in  servile positions, not allowed to achieve, as that
would be a kind of reward.   Those guys you see along the roadsides
picking up trash and putting them in  bright orange bags?  Mindwipes.
