<pre>      {regarding religion}

      I guess I'm partly leery of going into my personal views
on this stuff too much  because I'm very conscious of the
position of "celebrity" in our society, even as  minor a
celebrity as that of producer, of which there cannot possibly
be a smaller  version of celebrity.  It's possible to use
one's position as a platform for  advancing one's own personal
views, or propagating them, and I don't want to do  that, or
to be perceived as doing that.
