<h3>Section: Babylon 5: General<br>Date: December 29, 1995 9:16:11 PM</h3>
<pre>      &lt;Quoting Stevie Adam to JMS&gt;:

      &gt;Please, is there any way to threaten Channel 4 In the
      &gt;UK with a Centauri takeover  to get them to show series
      &gt;3 here before mid 96?

     I think it'll be spring, not mid-1996; also, remember
that they don't break up the  show with reruns, they air
straight through, and the episodes have to be  *finished* in
time for them to air them straight through (and I think WB is
trying to  avoid the problem last time of stuff airing in the
UK first).  But as yet I haven't  heard a final date on this.
