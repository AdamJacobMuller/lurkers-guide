<pre>      &lt;Quoting Trent K. Johnson to JMS&gt;:

      &gt;I think I recall reading that Mr. Doyle worked at one
      &gt;of the brokerage houses that  was involved in the junk
      &gt;bonds  &lt;snip&gt; Was he around during this? If so, I'd
      &gt;wager  he has a story or two...

     Yes, Jerry was working there at the time, and I believe
ended up testifying  about what happened.
