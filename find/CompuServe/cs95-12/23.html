      {regarding B5 screen saver compatibility with win95}

      Apparently the program *is* win95 compatible, at least that's what
it says, I  haven't yet upgraded, waiting a) for the bugs to get worked
out, and b) until I have  the time required for the learning curve of
installation.

      &lt;quoting John Sheridan to JMS&gt;:

      &gt;&gt;The learning curve for installing WIN95 is pretty short Joe.
      &gt;&gt;It's getting all of your software to run *after* you install WIN95
      &gt;&gt;is where the learning curve can become quite long......&lt;g&gt;.

      Yeah, that's the part that worries me.

      {regarding the losing of JMS's hair, due to pulling it out
       over win95}

      Funny.  Very funny.  Amerikanski humor.

      We bomb now.

      {regarding a Mac version of the B5 screen saver}

      As I understand it, the company wants to come out with a Mac version
in a  re-release of the program sometime in the spring.  It's just hitting
the market and  already it's doing quite well.
