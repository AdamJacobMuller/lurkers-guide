      {regarding Rangers being trained to fight the Shadows}

     This is one of those questions that can only best be

about this subject this season.

<pre>     Of course, judging from recent episodes, Sheridan seems
to have been a bit  remiss in continuing his lessons from

somewhere down the road.  Only question is who'll have to pay
it.
