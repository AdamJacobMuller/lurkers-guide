<h3>Section: Babylon 5: General<br>Date: December 22, 1995 9:11:00 PM</h3>
<pre>     Actually, over long breaks like Christmas I generally
tend to *drop* a few  pounds.  At the stage I eat a big lunch
out back with everyone else, then make  myself a decent dinner
when I get home, and there's always the odd doughnut  lying
around at the stage catering table (Death With A Hole In The
Middle).   Whereas at home, I don't generally eat a big
breakfast, or any kind of real lunch;  just nibble a bit
throughout the day, and then make my dinner.
