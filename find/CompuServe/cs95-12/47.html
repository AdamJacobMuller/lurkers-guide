<h3>Section: Babylon 5: Upcoming<br>Date: December 05, 1995 1:11:21 AM</h3>
<pre>     If there were just one pure and unchanged unvirsal soul running
through  everything, there wouldn't be any point in breaking itself into
pieces and investing  itself in different species/people...it would just
keep running into identical  versions of itself.

     So the soul form in Minbari is different from the soul form in
humans; also, in  their view, having been civilized longer than us, their
soul form is more elevated,  more evolved...and thus the pices are more
precious, to them, and to the Soul  Hunters.
