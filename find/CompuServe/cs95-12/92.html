<h3>Section: Babylon 5: General<br>Date: December 17, 1995 10:27:08 PM</h3>
<pre>      &lt;Quoting Anne Warner to JMS&gt;

      &gt;Without suggesting anything that hasn't been clearly
      &gt;indicated on the air as  interesting history, could we
      &gt;give you our opinions about what "history" we'd like 
      &gt;to see???

      &gt;One of my votes would go to Valen and the origins of
      &gt;the Grey Council.


     Then you will get your wish, and then some.
