<pre>      &lt;Quoting David Chandler-Gick to JMS&gt;:

      &gt;What was your initial reaction to finding out about Mr.
      &gt;Doyle's "embellished"  resume, and how did you "deal"
      &gt;with it?

      Well, I just kinda figured it fit in perfectly with the
character; that's something  Garibaldi would've done....
