<pre>      &lt;Quoting Philip Hornsey to JMS&gt;:

      &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm making this show, first and foremost, for
      &gt;myself, on the theory that what I  find interesting,
      &gt;others may also find of interest.
      &gt;
      &gt;ROFLMAO!
      &gt;
      &gt;Joe...
      &gt;
      &gt;I *hate* to tell you this...but worded *slightly
      &gt;differently...that's a Rush Limbaugh  quote...
      &gt;
      &gt;I will now flee the country and leave no forwarding
      &gt;address.

     Be advised that the only thing standing between you and
the abyss is my  assumption that you're making this up....
