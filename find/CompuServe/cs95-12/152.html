      &lt;Quoting Gerald Himmelein to JMS&gt;:

      &gt;The "pleasure treshold" line was completely destroyed
      &gt;in translation, btw. &lt;sigh&gt;

     Alas, there's nothing I can do at this end about the
translations; it's out of my  hands.

     Yes, at this point, barring any work-related emergencies,
I've confirmed for  Necronomicon.  I'm looking forward to it;
it'll be the first time I've been in Floida.

<h3>Section: Babylon 5: General<br>Date: December 31, 1995 10:44:21 PM</h3>
<pre>     Actually, from my perspective, it was never intended as
a shot at Christians at  all; it was a warning shot to any
breed of fanaticism that does not question itself,  that
assumes, for whatever reason, that it is right and must impose
that  rightness on others, no matter the price (usually paid
by others).  To quote a line  from "Infection," "When you
become obsessed with the enemy, you *become*  the enemy."  So
I guess you could describe it as a shot at Christianity only
if you  choose to define it in those terms; if not, then it's
not.

     Certainly, though, it does point to being sure that one
is doing what one is  doing for the right reasons, and the sin
of pride, which we all know has a  tendency to goeth before a
fall.

     For me, one of the important things about this show is to
make people *think*  about what they believe.  If they come
right back to what they originally believed,  that's fine. 
But they've *considered why* they believe it.  In all too many
cases,  our beliefs -- social, political, religious -- are
just sort of *there*, invisible,  ineffable and unassailable,
as much a part of the universe as the air around us.   We
don't necessarily think WHY we believe it...we do.  Which is
why, all too often,  when someone is challenged on what they
believe, they don't have the tools to  defend it in any way
other than force or anger.  But if you *have* considered your 
beliefs, and you know why you feel a certain way, you can
articulate it, explain it,  and be more self-confident in it. 
It allows you to have discussions rathe than  arguments,
schisms, or border wars.

     Like I said, I don't have any answers...all I got are
some questions, but they're  pretty good questions.  Our
greatest peril is always the danger of the  unexamined life.

     Re: C.S. Lewis...yes, I've read his stuff, from the
Screwtape Letters (which are  great fun) to Perelandra and
That Hideous Strength and others, including some  of his
polemics and essays on christianity.  He was a good thinker
and a facile  writer...which was sometimes good, and sometimes
not so, because he had a  tendency to set up straw-man
arguments, which made for more persuasive  dogma but not
always reasonable discussion.

     And yes, I've read the bible cover to cover, twice.  Some
good moral tales, an  awful lot of blood and violence, some
real slow parts (anyone who can make it  all the way through
Numbers and Deuteronomy has my unbridled respect),  some real
potboilers, a few plot holes and an inconsistent hero, but
overall,  commendable reading.  (Though one could argue that
any number of later  writers did a better job of pure writing
than is present in the bible -- no  self-respecting writer
would stop the narrative so often for a few thousand begats 
and the discussion of cubits...well, except maybe for Herman
Mellville, who had  far too many asides on whaling technology
as parentheticals in Moby Dick...and  one should certainly
think that a deity would be at least a good a writer as 
Pynchon or Salinger or Joyce...still, there are spurts of
greatness; the book of Job  is possibly one of the best
stories ever written, and there's much in Psalms and  Proverbs
to commend itself to anyone...though best to keep the Song of 
Solomon out of the hands of kids...some racy stuff there....)
