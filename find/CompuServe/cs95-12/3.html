<pre>&lt;Mind wipes were presented too positively.&gt;

      I'm not sure I presented it positively; I just presented it, didn't make
a moral judgement about it.  Some of those in the show did, but then we had
Edward saying it *isn't* moral, that it's a monstrous thing to do.  Like any
form of punishment it can seem fair to those not facing it.

                                                                       jms
