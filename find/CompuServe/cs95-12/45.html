<pre>      {regarding Christ's repenting for the sins of others}

     Carol: *exactly* the right point.  In his earlier talk about
Gethsemane, Edward  mentioned that old JC had to go through all that to
atone for the sins of others;  when he sees Theo later, through the grate,
he uses the same notion of  atonement for the acts of another, in this
case, *his* other.  The logical parallel  parses pretty closely.
