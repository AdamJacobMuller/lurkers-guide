<pre>      {Regarding a request for a 7' bed for JMS}

      A 7-foot bed, eh?  Good, that's just long enough for me
and a cat foot-warmer.   Does the bed come complete with cat,
or is cat considered extra in the UK?   (Eight inches should
be enough room for a cat, provided it is a medium sized  cat;
if it is a much larger cat than 8 inches across, we may have
to purchase a  cat-mallet.)
