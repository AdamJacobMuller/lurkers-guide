<h3>Section: Babylon 5: General<br>Date: December 22, 1995 9:11:02 PM</h3>
<pre>      &lt;Quoting Ruth Spradlin to JMS&gt;:

      &gt;Jean Paul Vaudreuil of Thomasville, GA wrote to
      &gt;Entertainment Weekly:
      &gt;
      &gt;"Bruce Boxleitner's worried about Babylon 5's low
      &gt;ratings?  A few helpful hints:  1.   Instead of modest
      &gt;uniforms, squeeze Commander Ivanova into a revealing 
      &gt;bodysuit.  2.  Replace decipherable dialogue with
      &gt;incomprehensible technobabble.  3.  Rid characters of
      &gt;human flaws so they'll be perfect role  models.  
      &gt;4.  Rather than fascinate us with character evolution,
      &gt;keep major  players static.  5.  Merchandise like
      &gt;crazy:  Bab5 toothbrushes, boxer shorts, and  an
      &gt;endless supply of toys.  6.  Have the aliens look like
      &gt;humans with forehead  problems.  7.  A surefire way to
      &gt;increase ratings?  Put Star Trek somewhere in  the
      &gt;title."

      &gt;Maybe you should hire this guy as a consultant.  ;-)

     Boy, he really gets it, doesn't he?  Exactly correct.

     It amazes me sometimes to think that, if the words STAR
TREK were put in  front of this show, and it was *exactly* the
same show it is now, we'd get double  the ratings, added
national exposure, all the rest.  Ah, the world of 
showbidness....
