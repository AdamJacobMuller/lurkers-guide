<H2> Garibaldi's arm              </H2>
<h3>Section: Babylon 5: General<br>Date: December 03, 1995 12:52:13 AM</h3>
<pre>      Weird thing is that Claudia broke her foot in an episode where I
mentioned her foot (the same one, btw), and Jerry broke his arm in the
same episode where I have someone say to him, "What, you've got a broken
arm or something?"  Very, very weird...I've been asked *not* to make any
further reference to body parts of our various cast members, and I'm
*definitely* not having anything bad happen to any guest cast named
Dick....
