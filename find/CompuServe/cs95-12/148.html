<pre>      &lt;Quoting SysOp Dupa T. Parrot to JMS&gt;:

      &gt;On tonight's rerun of "Comes The Inquisitor", I see you
      &gt;took the hint from the  Brits and fixed the "West End"
      &gt;dialog. The dubbing job was pretty well done.

     Once the error was brought to my attention, I just
couldn't let it slide.
