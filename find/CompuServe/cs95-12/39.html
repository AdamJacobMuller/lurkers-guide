<h3>Section: Babylon 5: Upcoming<br>Date: December 05, 1995 1:11:11 AM</h3>
<pre>      One caveat here overall...it's been complimented and commented upon
that I  would expose a belief system in my show which I do not personally
agree with  (presenting the face of religion even though I'm an atheist).
That I could be this  tolerant is apparently praiseworthy.

      I would just suggest that at some point, when and if I should offer
a point of  view from another perspective, which one watching might not
personally agree  with, the same tolerance is given, since the virtue of
tolerating divergent attitudes  has been deemed praiseworthy...and is
something ever to strive for....
