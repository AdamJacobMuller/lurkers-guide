<h3>Section: Babylon 5: General<br>Date: December 24, 1995 10:42:29 PM</h3>
<pre>      &lt;Quoting Anne L. Warner to JMS&gt;:

      &gt;Here in New England, both WSBK  (Boston) and WNDS
      &gt;(Derry, NH) seem to have decided to try actually
      &gt;promoting  Babylon 5.

     Thanks; that's good to know, and definitely a welcome
change.
