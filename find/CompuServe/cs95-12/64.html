<pre>      {regarding JMS's celebrity status}

      Yeah, I don't really buy into the celebrity notion; what
I do is what I do, no  different than a teacher or an archi-
tect; both require varying levels of creativity.   Main thing
wrong with celebrity is that people start viewing you differ-
ently...and  Kosh help you if your own view of yourself starts
to reconcile too much with that  new perception.
