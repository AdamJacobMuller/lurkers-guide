<h3>Section: Babylon 5: General<br>Date: December 15, 1995 5:38:03 PM</h3>
<pre>      {regarding not enough time...}

      Except, of course, there's no need to transport steel
and other materials from  Earth...if that's your premise then
it's seriously flawed. You mine ore from the  surrounding
asteroids, as NASA has described for some time could be done. 
 You could assemble the shell off Earth in pieces fairly
quickly, use the jump gate  to get it to Epsilon Eridani, and
mine whatever else you need there in the area  fairly effi-
ciently.

      Bear in mind that building a station like this in 2260
uses many of the same  techniques already being used else
where...so in many cases it's a matter of  slightly converting
what's already being mass produced for other reasons.  
Explorer vessels like the Cortez, for instance, are nearly as
long as Babylon 5 (as  seen in "A Distant Star"), and its
rotating section is nearly as wide.  And you've  got other big
ships, many with rotational areas for gravity-positive
sections.  This  isn't like NASA gearing up to make a one-off
of something; this is a matter of  adjusting technology
already in use.
