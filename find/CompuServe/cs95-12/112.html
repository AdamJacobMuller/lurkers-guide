<pre>      &lt;Quoting John McAuley to JMS&gt;:

      &gt;Did you find out before you hired him?

     I found out the day he came in; I looked down and saw on
his resume "Dance  Theater of Harlem," and said "What the heck
is this?  Hey you, DANCE."  Since  then, he's forgotten this,
and continues to insist that nobody ever caught onto his 
little ploy.
