<pre>&lt;Why did it take so long for a med team to get to Edward?&gt;

      They were in a pretty distant part of DownBelow, and in B5 you don't
have trains or cars; there's just the transport tubes, and the central
core shuttle.  Even if they gave a damn about what happens to lurkers in
DownBelow (and they generally don't), it would still take at least 5-10
minutes to get a trauma team down there, and he was dead within about 3. 
(I was once mugged half a mile from a police station and a mile from a
hospital; took 'em 30 minutes to get there.)

     Sheridan and Theo didn't *discover* that Edward was using the
computer; Theo was concerned that he was looking into it in general.  And
if they had blocked the computer in his quarters, he would have been able
to access one somewhere else.  They didn't know he'd actually done it
until after the fact.
