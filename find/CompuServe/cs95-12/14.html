<pre>      Thanks.  It's definitely the strongest of the first four, I think. And
Pat is nothing less than terrific.  If there was any sense of hesitation in her
appearance in "Divided Loyalties," it can be attributed to the fact that she
had just given birth to her son something like 4-6 weeks prior, if that much,
and this was pretty much her first day back in the saddle.

                                                                       jms
