     We're making 22 episodes this year; interestingly enough,
because the  ratings have been doing quite well, there have
been some informal talks initiated  by some folks at PTEN
about us doing an additional 2 hours in the form of a  direct-
to-video movie, something to hold folks over between seasons. 
So in that  sense we'd be doing 24 this season.  It's not
finalized, but we're very encouraged  that they're considering
trying this with us.  We won't have any final disposition on 
this until well after Christmas, however.  The problem will be
in getting all the  pertinent WB divisions to work together on
this with us, and working with PTEN in  the sense that it
won't be aired initially until much later, which may be a 
stumbling block...but we'll see.  Still, it's a great vote of
confidence.

      {regarding direct-to-video B5 movie}

      Yeah, it'd have to be kind of like the comics...it would
add something to the arc, be complementary to it (like the
"shadows past" miniseries was complementary to "Divided
Loyalties" and stuff yet to come), but more or less  able to
stand on its own.

      Like I said, though, it ain't final yet, still in the
talking stages....

      I'd advise against suggesting story areas for this,
Philip.
