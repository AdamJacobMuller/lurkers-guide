<pre>      I need a little help here from US netters, 'cause something strikes me as
a bit wonky.  I've been getting the market-by-market ratings reports, and just
today I sat down to really study them, and something doesn't track. The market
report doesn't seem to reflect where I *think* the shows are currently being
aired.  So to the favor...if you're in one of these areas, let me know if the
time given here is DIFFERENT FROM the time it actually plays in your area.
(This seems especially curious to me since the report shows WTTY Indianapolis
up through the past week, and it was my understanding that they had temporarily
dropped the show until WNDY picked it up.)
