<H2>&lt;PTG: Mind Wipe&gt;</H2>
<h3>Section: <br>Date: 02-Dec-95  01:00:11</h3>
<pre>&lt;Where was the mindwipe performed?&gt;

      We established in "The Quality of Mercy" that the equipment to handle
mindwipes is there on-station, locked away until mandated by a court.  A court
assigned telepath is usually brought in to do a preliminary scan before it
happens and to verify the wipe immediately afterward.  In that same episode,
Talia was used only because a court teep wasn't available.

                                                                       jms
