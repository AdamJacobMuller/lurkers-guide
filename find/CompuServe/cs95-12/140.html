<pre>      {regarding joining fan club, etc}

     The details should be posted sometime after the first
part of the year. Re:  Talia...it's okay to be pissed about
that; it was intended to have that reaction.   Things *should*
get us annoyed when Psi Corps pulls a stunt like that.  And we
haven't heard the last of what happened to Talia, btw.  That's
the B5 universe for  you....
