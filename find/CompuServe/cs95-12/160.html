<H2> Will Zathras reappear? </H2>
<h3>Section: Babylon 5: Upcoming<br>Date: December 29, 1995 9:16:15 PM</h3>
<pre>      &lt;Quoting Gerald Himmelein to JMS&gt;:

      &gt;Comment: Zathras looked somewhat bird-like, much like
      &gt;an owl, a screech owl  (Kauz, in German). Now, Zathras
      &gt;behaves like a "komischer Kauz" (oddball). So  his
      &gt;behavior and appearance match, at least in German. &lt;g&gt;
      &gt;Coincidence or  cleverness on the creator's part?

     Coincidence; I ain't that smart.
