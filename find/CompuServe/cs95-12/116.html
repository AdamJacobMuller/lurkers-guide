<pre>     Yes, one thing we've been discussing with the friendly
folks at WB is licensing  the videos via the fan club as
limited editions.  I don't know how limited "limited"  is yet,
it kinda depends on our resources.  It may just be a few
thousand each as  we gear up.  (And while we've been told we
*can* make the deal, we haven't yet  geared up the paperwork,
as we've been waiting for the fan club paperwork to  come in
first.)  I'll certainly recommend 2 eps per tape when we do
it; any more  than that, and you go to 160 minute tape, which
is thinner, and breaks and  stretches more easily than 120
tapes.

     (We won't be able to do widescreen until WB authorizes
the re-telecineing of  the original negative film stock back
to its initial aspect ratio, and releases the  funds to do
that, which are considerable.)
