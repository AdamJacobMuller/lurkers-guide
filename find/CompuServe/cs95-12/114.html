<pre>      {regarding suggestions for Jawa's novel}

       Technical: if someone who knows scientific stuff said
"this character can't do  this because it's technically
impossible," I'd have to really consider it, if he could  give
me a good enough argument.  (And even there you have wiggle
room...what  we *think* is impossible now may not be in 200
years.  Serious scientists years  ago said that if you went
more than 60 miles an hour in a train or a car you'd be 
killed by the pressure.  So as long as you can make a plaus-
ible argument that  it's *possible,* even if it's highly
unlikely, you can sometimes get away with  rubber science.) 
If it's a big glaring issue, or in the present where you don't
have  alternate options, you may be stuck hewing to it.  If
the person suggested an  alternative, and that alternative
worked, and kept the science valid, sure, I'd take  it. That's
what a consultant is for.  As long as it doesn't compromise
the integrity  of the story.

       Who reads: Yes, do be careful in your selection.  Some
people will tell you  how to write it "better," when they
really mean "write it more like *I* would've  written it."  A
really bad reaction to what you've written, from someone you
like or  admire, can be an absolute soul-killer.  And they may
not be right.  May, in fact, be  quite wrong.  What you also
have to remember is what every writer learns: if you  put your
work out there, and you ASK for an opinion, suddenly they feel
that they  *must have* an opinion, and they *must find*
flaws...so instantly that tends to  skew things toward more
negative comments than might be the case if they just  picked
the book up off a store shelf and read it.  If you can find an
adult *writer* to  look at it, you may consider that...but to
go to non-writers for technical advice or  reactions or
suggestions on writing is often non-constructive.  Their
reaction to  the material may be valid, but they may not have
the language or know the writing  craft well enough to steer
you in the right direction, and may only succeed in  muddying
up the waters.  If I were working to be a draftsman, and 
finished my  first big design, I'd probably show it to another
draftsman before I showed it to my  Aunt Morgana la Fey.

       Whoever you turn to for advice, always remember that
that advice must  always be secondary to what the small, still
voice of the writer inside you insists  is correct.  You have
to find your own voice, and if that means not taking the other
person's suggestions, then that's what you have to do. Either
you'll be right, or  you'll be wrong, and you'll hear the same
comment from dozens of others, or  those in the field, and
then you may have to reconsider your position.  But initially, 
follow your voice.

       Magazine sales: no, your story can definitely be
published elsewhere  UNLESS the magazine specifically indi-
cates that it buys "all rights." Otherwise, it  will usually
buy other rights.  First North American rights are the most
common,  leaving you free to sell it to other magazines
overseas, and to other magazines in  the US after a reasonable
period has passed, or if it's to a non-competing  magazine. 
It's pretty much unheard of these days for magazines to buy
all rights.   (Suggestion: go to your local library and pick
up a copy of WRITER'S MARKET,  published yearly by Writer's
Digest Books.  They generally explain the various  rights you
sell in such situations.)
