<h3>Section: Babylon 5: Upcoming<br>Date: December 18, 1995 11:25:23 PM</h3>
<pre>     Actually, Mike Vejar is directing the two-parter, and I'm
absolutely thrilled about  it; Mike's been our mainstay for
some time, and he's just terrific.  (He directed  "Convic-
tions," and "Inquisitor.")

       Adam was great in that he's a *very* serious director
who sits down and  really thinks through the subtext of the
episode, the thematic aspects, the  underlying symbology, and
then sits with the actor and *really* works with them  so that
they fully understand the nuances of the scene.  A lot of TV
direction can  be rushed...you're always under the gun...so
it's rare to find someone who really  takes his time and
prepares the cast.

       "Does the pressure come from within, or does it come
from without and the  reaction of the fans of the series?"

       From within.  There's nothing I've ever seen on any net
that's half as critical of  this show as what's said by we who
make it.  If you try to gauge a show, any  show, and determine
its direction by viewer reactions, you're going to have 
pudding, because there are too many divergent reactions.  It
becomes one  massive committee...and committees are the death
of any creative process.

       I'm making this show, first and foremost, for myself,
on the theory that what I  find interesting, others may also
find of interest.  And I'm a perfectionist.  Also a  pain in
the ass.  Also monomanaical.  Just getting a show this big,
this involved,  this visually complex *made* is a task of
Herculean proportions...let alone  getting it made *well*.

       I've always been a very driven personality; I try never
to settle for second best.   If it can't be done just a little
better than what we did last week, why the hell are  we doing
it?  There *has* to be constant evolution, constant growth,
constant  challenge, or you're dead creatively.  You've got to
be absolutely willing to knock  all your support pins out from
under you, in the belief that your skills will enable  you to
land somewhere interesting on your feet.  The moment you
*stop* taking  that risk...you're finished.  At least, that's
what I feel about it.

       This show is probably my one real chance to leave a
mark that I passed this  way, so it has to be as good as I can
humanly make it.  And nothign will ever get  in the way of
that.
