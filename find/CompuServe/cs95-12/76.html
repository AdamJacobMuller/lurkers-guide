     Babylons 1-3 were destroyed during the very early stages
of construction, so  not that much was done.  They poured a
LOT of money into B4, which was very  big...when that one went
 south, they decided to try one last time, with a  stripped-
down version, B5.  B4 vanished 4 years prior to the first
season of B5.

<pre>      {regarding which upcoming episode would be best
       to have a B5 party for}

     If you want some fun with your wham, and there's a lot of
fun to be had in this  one, go for the first one up, "Voices
of Authority."  If you want serious, serious  wham, go for
"Messages From Earth."
