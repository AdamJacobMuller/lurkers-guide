      &gt;Meaning that originally, Garibaldi was going to be shot
      &gt;at by Laurel and since  she dropped out after The
      &gt;Gathering, you used Garibaldi's second in command  as
      &gt;a trap door? Very nicely done.

     Correct, had Laurel stayed with the station, it would've
been she who pulled  the trigger on Garibaldi.

      &gt;Would Laurel have been a PsiCorps-personality-implant-
      &gt;mole?

     Yes, Laurel would've been Control.
