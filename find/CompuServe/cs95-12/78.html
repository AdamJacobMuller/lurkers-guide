<pre>      {regarding "Passing Through Gethsemane" ep}

      Thanks.  Adam did a great job interpreting the script on
that one, and it's  definitely one of our most successful
episodes...though today I took a look at  another, more
completed version of episode 8, "Messages," and *man* is this 
amazing...just a knockout...trouble is we keep raising our own
bar and won't  accept anything less...so the pressure becomes
quite astonishing after a while.

     Fun, though....
