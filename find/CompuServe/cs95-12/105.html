<h3>Section: Babylon 5: General<br>Date: December 18, 1995 11:25:19 PM</h3>
<pre>       Jeez...where do I even start with that one...?

       Okay, "how would I evaluate the work that I've done on
the series to this  point."  (I assume this refers to the
scriptwriting part of my duties, rather than the  producing
part.)

       The first season, I think, was pretty fair.  There were
some rough spots here  and there.  There's a thing known to
athletes called getting "in the zone," that's  when you're
absolutely on target, in the groove, whatever jargon you wish
to throw in.  In any first season of a show, no matter howmuch
advance planning  has gone into the thing, there's a shakedown
period as you find out what really  *does* and doesn't work. 
There was a fair amount of that in year one.

       I think I only really popped into the "zone" a few
times, with the first real such  experience being "And the Sky
Full of Stars."  Once I hit it, I was able to find the  target
again a few more times that season, with "Mind War," "Babylon
Squared,"  "Chrysalis" and a couple of others.  But that was
about it.  I was trying to find a  new way of telling a story
for TV, and while I'd been thinking about it for a long  time,
there was never a chance to get in any *practice* because
except for  Power, which had a few arc aspects to it, no other
show WORKS like B5 in this  respect.  So there was still a
learning curve.

       Season two, I think, I started to Get It more often,
and more consistently.  I'd  learned a lot doing year one, and
was able to apply it. I don't think I could've  written "The
Coming of Shadows" in year one, I just hadn't yet acquired the
skills  that ONLY come through practice doing this very
unusual style of storytelling.  I  think I got into the zone
a little faster, with the last four in particular being right
on  the mark, for what I wanted to achieve.

       And as far as season three is concerned...though only
4 have aired, I'm  finishing #17 right now.  I usually gauge
where things are by the reaction the  scripts get around the
set...and this season, more than any other, I've had the 
actors and crew come by just shaking their heads in astonish-
ment at what's  coming down in the pages.  The folks at WB
have made it a point to call and say  that they're loving what
they're seeing in the scripts, and that's unusual.

       Subjectively -- and this opinion is the least valid,
since it's colored by my own  perception -- I think that at
this moment, I'm doing the best work of my career to  date. 
There's something happening in the scripts that...I can't
really define.   There's just something *there* that wasn't
there before, or was there only  sporadically.  The scripts
are completely taking on a life of their own.  (I related 
elsewhere that something very major happened in "Interludes
and Examinations," #15, that was never, ever in the arc, that
I hadn't planned on doing  when I began the script...but the
damned thing just *happened*...and all I could  do was watch
it unfold on the page.)

       Out of 17 to date, the only one that's *slightly*
clunky is "Exogenesis,"  because it's just a little too
straightforward for my tastes. I'd thought it was going  to be
something other than what it was; there's a writing phrase,
"it's too much  what it is."  But it has some great character
moments in it, and I think that  redeems it to some extent.

       But that's it, that's the only one.  "Messages From
Earth" may be, in my view,  the best thing we've ever done. 
And the rest are just nifty.  I'm pleased and proud  and
utterly astonished at how well some of this stuff has come out
this season.

       (I *suspect* that part of the reason for the improve-
ment this season is that  I'm not outlining each episode as
much as before.  I used to sit down and break  out each act in
detail, and then stick pretty strongly to that outline.  Now
I just sit  down, knowing where I have to go with the story,
and write it straight through,  letting the characters take
control from time to time.  It takes a long time to be  able
to trust yourself, your ability, and your characters before
you can do that in a  show; finally I'm there.)

       "what directions do you see the series going in now,
that you might not have  considered back when you first
started?"

       Well, it's hard to say, in large measure because of
what I've reported in the  paragraphs preceding.  The series
has taken on a life of its own now, and while I  know where
it's going, from time to time this great big unweildy beast
throws me  off and goes where it wants.  And I'd be a fool if
I refused to listen to that, and  forced it to comply with
what I'd come up with in 1987.  Because that's the key 
thing that I've come to understand. The structure was written
in 1987/88...and I'm  a much better writer now than I was
then.  I still intend to reach the destination I'd  imagined,
but I've found FAR more interesting ways to get there than I
could've  imagined then. Remember, since 1987 I worked on the
Twilight Zone, Nightmare Classics, Murder She Wrote...I've
learned a lot of stuff and acquired  some tools I didn't have
back then.

       So long answer made short...I think that the main
difference is that the rest of  the story is going to be more
ambitious, more dramatic, more fundamentally  *interesting*
than I had ever hoped for.  And given what was there before,
that's  saying a lot.
