<h3>Section: Babylon 5: General<br>Date: December 31, 1995 10:44:22 PM</h3>
<pre>      &lt;Quoting Ray Pelzer to JMS&gt;:

      &gt;Joe:  Thanks for letting my take up so much space in
      &gt;your section with this whole  USENET/CIS-censorship
      &gt;issue.  I only considered that many people would read 
      &gt;the nessage if it was in Section 5, but I didn't
      &gt;consider the impact it was having on  B5-related
      &gt;messages.  Now that the ball is rolling, I'm going to
      &gt;move the  messages to Section 19, and thank you again
      &gt;for your patience with me.

     No problem.
