<pre>      {regarding why Paramount doesn't move DS9 to UPN}

     I don't know for certain, but I'd suspect that there are
contractual elements  prohibiting this.  UPN is an alliance
between Paramount and Chris Craft  Television; at this point,
CCT is paying virtually all the money for developing and 
airing the shows, with Paramount contractually able to buy 50%
of the network  sometime in the next year or so.  (This per
the trades and reports in industry  business journals.)

     DS9 is currently owned exclusively by Paramount.  Many of
the stations that  currently air DS9 are not necessarily part
of the UPN network; some are Tribune  stations, or other
independents.  If they made it part of UPN, they would then 
have to shuffle around a lot of stations, and might end up
losing better time slots  and it's a *lot* of hassle.  And
Paramount would have to be willing to turn over  partial
ownership of DS9 to Chris Craft (here I'm guessing), and they
may not  want to do that, may possibly not be *able* to do so
by contract.

     It's a very confusing corporate web, not that unlike the
situation which basically  prevents B5 from going to the WB
network.
