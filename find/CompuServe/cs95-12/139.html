<h3>Section: Babylon 5: General<br>Date: December 25, 1995 2:27:24 AM</h3>
<pre>      &lt;Quoting Burhaan Ahmad to JMS&gt;:

      &gt;You said you would like to make the  tapes yourself,
      &gt;since WB obviously won't.  Does Babylonian have the
      &gt;resources  to pull it off to the quality you desire? 
      &gt;I know little about the industry, but it seems  to me
      &gt;that it would be an expensive operation.  Or would you
      &gt;look to lisence the  rights to someone other than WB
      &gt;(assuming they'd allow it)?

     That's something we're trying to decide now.  If we did
them ourselves, it'd  almost certainly be on a limited-edition
basis, to control quality.
