&gt;       Knowing folks here, I'm sure *somebody* has my original post filed
&gt; away somewhere. I'm happy to see that reposted, because it is exactly as I
&gt; have characterized it.

Sure, no problem.

People read into messages what they want to read. Human
nature.

     Speaking of TPTB, here's an interesting angle on the
whole Voyager/DS9 dynamic.

     Recently, more and more, the ST execs (people like Berman
and Pillar) have been commenting publicly about the factional
ization of the SF TV marketplace, and how this has diminished
the numbers for the ST shows overall.  Most interestingly, one
of them commented in an LA Times article this past week that
a big problem for them is the factionalization *within*
ST...that people may only have time to watch one version of ST
 that week, and they're being forced to choose.  And, of
course, there are the debates between the two sides on
quality.

     Which dovetails precisely into the rumor running around
town that Paramount is considering giving the axe to DS9 after
this season, in order to force folks who want their ST to
watch Voyager...because they have more money invested right
now in Voyager, particularly in start-up, and they have their
hopes for the Paramount network pinned to Voyager as their
center. They don't like the idea of a syndicated show out
there causing problems for the network on which they've spent
millions and millions of dollars.  And DS9's ratings have been
steadily on the decrease since the debut.  So the logic goes:
take away DS9, and make those who want Trek go to Voyager as
the sole provider of that.

     Given the sources from whom this has come, I give very
high credibility to the notion that this *is* being discussed;
whether or not it will be implemented, that only time will
tell.  If Voyager continues to decrease, threatening the
foundations of Paramount's bid for a network, I'd think the
chances of this happening will continue to rise.

&gt;Subj:  Ds9 Cancellation Rumor       Section: Star Trek: DS9

&gt;From:  J. Michael Straczynski       #417729

     THANK you.  As the message said, the topic *was* being
discussed, but that  there was no indication as to whether or
not that step would eventually be  implemented.  And others
confirmed this.  Nowhere in that message was it  stated by me
that the show *is* going to be canceled, or that I'd heard
anyone  else say that it was going to be canceled.

     With luck, this will finally put an end to the distor
tions that get around, thanks  to some people who want to fuel
online wars.

     Thanks again for digging this out.

&gt;Why does your saying an episode is serious make me so
&gt;nervous?

     I don't know, but it should make you *really* nervous....
