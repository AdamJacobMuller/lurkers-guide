<h3>Section: Babylon 5: General<br>Date: December 24, 1995 6:14:15 PM</h3>
<pre>     Now that the fan club has been officially announced,
though the organizational  aspects are just now starting, we
may try and gear up to hold an official B5  convention in
about a year.  What we've talked about is the idea of having
it here  in LA, so we could have best chance of getting as
many cast members as  possible.  We'd also try and run it so
that it was as close as possible to a fan-run  convention in
the feeling it created; and as well as cast members and the
like,  there would be seminars and presentations by our people
in prosthetics,  wardrobe, makeup, art direction, props and
other areas, so it'd be a real learning  opportunity.

     But, again, that's at least a year down the road.
