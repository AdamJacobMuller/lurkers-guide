      {regarding direct-to-video B5 movie}

       Whoa, whoa, whoa...Jawa, don't mis-state the situation.
The deal still hasn't  been set, and even if it were, it
couldn't possibly be out "sometime after  christmas," during
the rerun cycle.

       It might be able to come out *between seasons three and
four* is, I believe,  what I said.  Bear in mind that I'd have
to write it, it takes 4-6 weeks to prep such  a thing, 15-16
days to shoot it, then another 52 days to finish post.

       Just to clarify...I don't want this getting picked up
and announced as fact yet  when it ain't.  Still may not even
happen.

     You'll be hearing more about General Hague in the next
batch of episodes; as  for the two-parter, I'm about 13 pages
from the end of part one, which I hope to  turn in on Monday,
and the second part will probably be in after the Christmas 
break.

<pre>      {regarding artificial gravity on Narn ship in the
       novel _Blood_Oath_}

      Urk...that must've slipped past me (which reminds me,
I'd better get back to  finishing proofing the next novel). 
And yes, we'll see more of the Narn  homeworld as we go along.
