      {regarding if Garibaldi's shooting was pre-planned}

     No, the shooting of Garibaldi was always a very strong
part of the story for the  end of first season; that line goes
all the way back to the pilot, and Laurel  Takashima.

<H2> Ds9 Cancellation Rumor       </H2>
<h3>Section: Star Trek: DS9<br>Date: December 17, 1995 10:47:23 PM</h3>
<pre>"I agree it is rediculous but JMS reported it at a Comic
conference somewhere  and I was giving what I consider good
advice to all who wish to do something  positive in lieu of
his negative comment. Read previous messages about the 
cancellation rumor so you can direct your anger to the proper
sources. I did not  start this and I will not speak further on
this rumor because it is exactly what JMS  wants. He loves for
us to argue among ourselves. Be careful, he may be reading 
and enjoying this right now!"

       Excuse me just one damned minute here.  I just found
out about this thread,  and once again this is being totally
and 100% distorted by you.

       I have never, ever, at any time posted a rumor saying
"Hey, DS9 is going to  be canceled."  If you can find it, and
post it, I will resign from Compuserve  *instantly* and
*permanently*.  But you won't, because it doesn't exist.  What
you,  and a few others, do is take what *was* said, throw it
out there to cause a  firestorm, which gets me in trouble.

       What I said was this: that at the time all this took
place, several months ago,  there were several articles
published -- in TV Guide, in the Los Angeles Times,  elsewhere
quoting people like Kerry McCluggage, the head of Paramount,
who  was concerned that having two ST shows around was cutting
into the potential  viewers for Voyager.  Even one of the exec
producers over at ST commented, in  the LA Times article, that
they may have gone to the well once too often.

       At the same time as this, there was a rumor floating
around town, which is  *still* floating around, that Paramount
was concerned about the notion of two  shows splitting the
potential ST audience...an audience that is necessary to 
Voyager as the cornerstone for the Paramount Network, UPN.
There's much to  be said for canceling one show, DS9, so that
there's only one place to go if you  want to see Star
Trek...Voyager.  Because Paramount has *millions* of dollars 
more invested in their network than in the standard syndica
tion deal for DS9.

       The *possibility* was being discussed, came the word on
the street. And  several other people in the industry, who
work in post production and sound  editing at the other
studios around town, came forth and supported this by saying 
they'd heard much the same.  But it's only woolgathering,
nothing more, and I  never said it WAS anything more than
that.  But a few people like you and a  couple of others have
taken that one message, which I posted only once, here,  not
some "comics conference," and crossposted it to other forums,
paraphrased  it, distorted it, and changed it around in order
to make it look like I posted a rumor  that I *never* in fact
posted, for the simple purpose of causing me grief.

       While there's much to commend this electronic forum,
what's *wrong* with it  at root is that people can come in
here, post something like this as if it's true,  and then you
have to respond to it and chase it down.

       Knowing folks here, I'm sure *somebody* has my original
post filed away  somewhere.  I'm happy to see that reposted,
because it is exactly as I have  characterized it.

       Look, I get in enough trouble for the things I *really*
say without other people  putting words in my mouth and
deliberately distorting it.

       I have never, ever, at any time, said that DS9 was
going to be canceled, or  that there was a rumor on the
streets that DS9 was going to be canceled.  Never  happened. 
Are we clear on this now?
