      &lt;Quoting Jon Wolf to JMS&gt;:

      &gt;I just re-watched Coming of Shadows, and I think we got
      &gt;our introduction to  Zack in this show. 

     I'm not sure though that that's the first time we saw
Zack; I keep thinking it was  earlier...I seem to remember him
breaking up a fight as the first time we saw  him.
