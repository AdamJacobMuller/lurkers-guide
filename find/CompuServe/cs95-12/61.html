<pre>     And this is quite correct; WB had always wanted a well
known actor in that  rols, so when we decided to make the
change, WB repeated this, and urged us  strongly in this
direction.  Happily, Bruce was known to us through Doug and 
John who'd worked with him on other projects, and said he was
a swell guy in  addition to a terrific actor; we met, talked,
and that was that.
