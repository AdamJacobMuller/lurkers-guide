<pre>      &lt;quoting The Jawa / Jawa #2 to JMS&gt;:

      &gt;So, like Sheridan, Ivanova wasn't a "replacement"
      &gt;character?

     All the characters are unique; there seems to be this
bone-headed notion, that  I frequently run into, of "Well,
Ivanova's just Takashima renamed," or "Sheridan's  story is
just the same as Sinclair's, same guy just renamed."  They're
*not* and  never have been.  The story of one does not devlove
automatically upon the  other.  If you make a change, it's
because you have something better in  mind...otherwise why
make it?
