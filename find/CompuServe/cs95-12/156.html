<pre>      &lt;Quoting Daniel Barer to JMS&gt;:

      &gt;I was watching "Comes the Inquisitor" with closed-
      &gt;captioning on tonight (easier  to ride the exercise
      &gt;bike while watching that way) and noticed that Sheridan
      &gt;now  states (correctly) the murders occured in the East
      &gt;End, while the captions (and  Boxleitner's lips, on re-
      &gt;viewing) still say West End.  Glad you fixed the slip--
      &gt;are the captions etched in stone?

     Y'know, I'd totally forgotten about the captions.







     Nuts.
