      Yes, long-distance com systems like StellarCom are
tachyon based;  communication inside hyperspace to and from
normal space is very difficult and  problematic due to the
differing physics involved; the beacons ships ride in  between
jumpgates are more or less anchored to the gates at the
hyperspace  side.

      That's my story and I'm sticking to it.

      {regarding there being physical protrusions into
      hyperspace}

     Not that anyone's discovered yet.  (Don't read into that
more than there is.)

     "...yeah, I was shooting the breeze with Jon just a few
days ago. Jon's going to  try and get B2 re-run on my sugges-
tion."

     Er...it's Joe, actually.

     That aside, thanks for the kind words, and we'll try to
get it rerun.

      {regarding picking your own CompuServe name}

      Actually, I haven't picked any such name...what's the
procedure for doing this?

       the first season of B5}

     They'll be playing the entire series, but not until the
show has run its full  course, so around 1998.
