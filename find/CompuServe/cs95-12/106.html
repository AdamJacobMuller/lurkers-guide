      &lt;Quoting Trent K. Johnson to JMS&gt;:

      &gt;One of the many, many things I applaud about your
      &gt;writing is not only the  avoidance of technobabble, but
      &gt;avoiding techno-traps so prevalent in "the other 
      &gt;shows".
      &gt;
      &gt;A case in point from "ST: Voyager":  A writer (or
      &gt;writers) comes up with the idea to  land the ship on a
      &gt;planet. (Earhart episode)  In a subsequent episode we
      &gt;then  get, "Can't transport.  Can't use a shuttle. 
      &gt;Hey!  Let's land.  Uh, we can't because,  uh, yeah, the
      &gt;ground's too soft.  Yeah!  That's it!"
      &gt;
      &gt;&lt;sigh&gt;

     "sigh" indeed....

<pre>      &lt;quoting Philip Hornsey to JMS&gt;:

      &gt;we have come to the  conclusion, recently, that by the
      &gt;time it is over, B5 *may* be the exception that  proves
      &gt;that general rule.

       Yes, it does feel more like a novel now than anything
else.

       (BTW, "the exception proves the rule" is a bastardiza-
tion of the original Latin  phrase, "exceptio probat regulum"
(from memory), which means "the exception  puts the rule to
the test of proof.")
