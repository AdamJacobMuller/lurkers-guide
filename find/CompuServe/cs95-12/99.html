<h3>Section: Babylon 5: General<br>Date: December 21, 1995 4:07:15 AM</h3>
<pre>      &lt;Quotong Robert Miller to JMS&gt;:

      &gt;If Laurel had stayed on the show, would she have
      &gt;received the password by this  point in the story?  Who
      &gt;would then have taken over as second in command? 

     If Laurel *had* stayed with the show, by the middle of
year two the fact that she  was Control would've been revealed
via the password incident. At that point, one  particular
possibility was that her second in command under her -- a
rather dour  Russian lieutenant named Ivanova -- would've been
promoted to take her place,  while Laurel was moved off the
chessboard. (This was planned because we  knew going in that
Tamlyn Tomita had a growing film career, and we probably 
could've only kept her for a couple of years in the best of
circumstances.  So why  not turn that to your advantage?)

     The position now being occupied by Corwin, Ivanova's
second, is the position  that Ivanova would've held (though
more prominently) if Laurel had stayed on.   (And no, Corwin
doesn't now have that arc lurking in the background.)

     See, it's easy to stick to an outline and never diverge
if you're writing  characters in a novel; in a TV show, with
live actors, you have to be flexible, plan  ahead, come up
with contingency plans, and have threads that weave and 
interlock in ways to leave you maximum flexibility while still
proceeding toward  your destination.
