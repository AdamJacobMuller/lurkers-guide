<pre>      &lt;quoting The Jawa / Jawa #2 to JMS&gt;:

      &gt;Is it true that for awhile, the traitor was going to be
      &gt;Ivanova?

     No, after the thread with Laurel was revealed, lots of
people *assumed* that  that thread had been passed along to
Ivanova.  It had never in fact been intended  for her, but
when it was broached, I simply didn't reply, on the theory
that if I said it  *wasn't* her, it'd narrow it down to who it
*was*.
