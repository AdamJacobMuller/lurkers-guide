      And bear in mind that it's never just a common sense "oh, these guys
are  lying to me from Nightwatch, they're the bad guys."  It's always
couched in such a  way that it sounds like it *might* be a real concern. 
That was how McCarthy and  others terrorized this country during the
1950s.  There were plenty of people who  really *believed* that the Reds
had infiltrated every aspect of society, as well as  those who might've
had doubts, but figured that maybe where there's smoke  there IS fire.

      Re: mindwipes no longer considered people...this really is not that
much  different from prison inmates, who are given numbers, have no real
civil rights,  and are treated like cattle.  (And many of them deserve it;
a few deserve worse; a  few deserve better.)

     On one level, I'm in favor of the death penalty.  I think that if
someone takes  your life deliberately, they sacrifice their own in return.
Some might say it's not a  deterrent in general...but it sure as heck
deters that specific person.

     *On the other hand*...I take that position mainly because nowadays,
when  someone is sentenced to life, "life" means about 15 years at best. 
If life  imprisonment MEANT life inprisonment, then I'd happily go for
that option above  the death penalty (and that certainly does leave room
for verdict corrections).

<pre>      I just put the mindwipe issue out there, I didn't make a moral
judgment about  it...in 2260, that's what's done.  I just report the
news....
