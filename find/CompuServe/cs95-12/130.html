<H2> The Battle of the Line..  </H2>
<h3>Section: Babylon 5: Upcoming<br>Date: December 21, 1995 11:23:04 PM</h3>
<pre>      &lt;Quoting Alexander Shaw to JMS&gt;:

      &gt;A major part of series 1 was based around the battle of
      &gt;the line, and  why the Minbari suddenly surrendered..
      &gt;Now that we are about to start season  three there are
      &gt;still some things that have not been clarified regard-
      &gt;ing this.. We  know (or at least think) the Religous
      &gt;Caste of the Minbari stopped the slaughter  of Mankind
      &gt;due to some Prophecy.. It would appear that this
      &gt;prophecy indicated  that mankind would have some major
      &gt;role in an upcoming struggle/war (The  Shadows I
      &gt;presume). 
      &gt;
      &gt;Are we ever going to have this confirmed ? Are we going
      &gt;to find out the exact  details of this prophecy ?
      &gt;Basically is the exact story of the Battle of Line
      &gt;going to  be revealed and cleared up as I still feel
      &gt;there are some qustions or nagging  doubts regarding
      &gt;it.

     Yep.  I expect you'll have this all clarified for you by
end of this season.
