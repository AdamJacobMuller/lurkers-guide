<h3>Section: Babylon 5: General<br>Date: December 18, 1995 11:25:09 PM</h3>
<pre>      &lt;Quoting Anne L. Warner to JMS&gt;:

      &gt;Oh, dear!  Coming from you, such reassurance (that I'll
      &gt;get my wish to learn  about Valen and the Grey Council
      &gt;"and then some.") is very disturbing.  I'll wait 
      &gt;eagerly.  Do I hold my breath? or is this months or
      &gt;seasons in the future?


     Figure by the end of this season you'll know a lot more
about all this.
