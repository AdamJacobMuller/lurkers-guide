<h3>Section: Babylon 5: General<br>Date: December 10, 1995 7:38:02 PM</h3>
<pre>      {regarding making videos of B5 episodes}

     Won't work.  Their logic (such as it is) is that if
people have already seen the  episode on TV, they won't want
to buy it...but a direct-to-video supplemental  episode, by
virtue of *not* having been aired, IS commercially viable.

     What can I say...?
