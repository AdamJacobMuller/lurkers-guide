<pre>      &lt;Quoting Gerald Himmelein to JMS&gt;:

      &gt;two days ago, I finally got around to purchase the
      &gt;Compact Disc release of The  Who's classic WHO'S NEXT
      &gt;album [remastered, with bonus tracks and new liner 
      &gt;notes... really nice...] from 1971.

      &gt;When I read through the fine print, I found myself
      &gt;gasping in surprise.

      &gt;"Original vinyl sleeve design by Kosh."

      &lt;snip&gt;

      &gt;This Kosh appears to be a  photigrapher and designer,
      &gt;and he apparently went with just that name, just  Kosh.

      &lt;snip&gt;

      &gt;my question would be whether you were aware of this 
      &gt;designer / photographer talent of the 70's and if his
      &gt;name became the inspiration for the Vorlon Ambassador.


      No, I'd absolutely never heard this story before...I'm
astounded....
