<pre>      &lt;Quoting Bill Sheldon to JMS&gt;:

      &gt;I was at SDCC for your showing of the TLTS, my 
      &gt;favorite episode to date.  &lt;snip&gt;  I saw a  really nice
      &gt;Duck Dodgers animation cell.  Did you get an early 
      &gt;X-mas present  from yourself?

      No, didn't pick up that one, though I thought about it. 
Problem is there's too  MUCH cool stuff at SDCC...which is why
I go every year.
