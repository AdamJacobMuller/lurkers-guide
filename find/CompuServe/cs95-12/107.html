<h3>Section: Babylon 5: General<br>Date: December 20, 1995 6:28:00 PM</h3>
<pre>      &lt;Quoting Tom Knudsen to JMS&gt;:

      &gt;     &lt; (BTW, "the exception proves the rule" is a
      &gt;bastardization of the  original Latin phrase, "exceptio
      &gt;probat regulum" (from memory), which means  "the
      &gt;exception puts the rule to the test of proof.")&gt;
      &gt;
      &gt;     You've been getting a lot of use out of that
      &gt;tidbit of knowledge lately,  haven't you?&lt;G&gt;

       I paid for this college education, and by god I'm going
to use it for SOMEthing.

       Odd that this particular phrase has cropped up so much
in recent weeks.   Another bugaboo of mine is the use of the
word "less" when what the person  means to say is "fewer." 
"There are less people here today."  No, "There are  *fewer*
people here today."  There are very few things about which I
will actually  correct someone in the course of speaking, not
wishing to be overly pedantic...but this is one of them.  The
other is when I see a sign that says FOR  "SALE"...well, is it
for sale or isn't it?

       Anal retentive?  Moi?
