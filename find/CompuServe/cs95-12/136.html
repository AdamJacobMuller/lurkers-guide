      &lt;Quoting The Jawa / Jawa #2 to JMS&gt;:

      &gt;B5 is heading in Trek's direction: very low-key while
      &gt;it's on the air, and  then comes it's fame.

     That's the key, I think; I have a suspicion that, like
the original ST, our main  attention will likely come after
we've finished our complete run. The show was  designed to be
seen in a stripped (once daily) fashion, that's when you
really can  see the arc moving quickly.  And on TNT, once it
hits that distributer, it'll finally  have what it has never
had before in this country: a national broadcaster and a 
regular timeslot.  Once that happens, I expect that what
happened in the UK will  happen here finally...it'll be
Noticed.

     Starting 1998, the show will appear in daily form on TNT;
it's already been  sold to there.

       Well, WB, anyway.  I get a net profit on the series,
which means after all the  costs have been taken out...which
in turn means that the show will never show a  profit (on
paper), so I ain't getting a dime of the TNT sale.
