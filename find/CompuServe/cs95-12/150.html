<h3>Section: Babylon 5: General<br>Date: December 29, 1995 9:30:18 PM</h3>
<pre>     {If Talia was Control, why would she order herself eliminated?}

     My sense was that the Control part, which sometimes moved
at night,  reported that the mission could be jeapordized. 
Then B13 gave the order to  eliminate.  Nowhere does it say
that Control said the second half of the  sentence.
