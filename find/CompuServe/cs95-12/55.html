     You're saying Sinclair was the chosen one...first, you don't know
what he was  chosen FOR.  Second, if this is entirely true, why would
Zathras look Sinclair  dead in the face and say "NOT the one"?

     As for "why would he change his story"...nothing is set in stone; if
you were a  writer, you'd know that an outline only gets you into the
story and the main points.   I've had whole novels that I've written
abruptly change direction halfway through  because of something I
discovered midway that was better than what I'd planned  initially.  You
adjust.  No outline ever survives contact with the enemy.

     If, tomorrow, I decided that the rest of this story would be better
if Sheridan  were transformed into a giant blue space moose, that's
exactly what I'd do.

<pre>      Thanks.  At this point, Richard's part was a one-shot, but if we
come up with  the right role, I'd love to see him again.
