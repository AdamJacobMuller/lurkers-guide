<h3>Section: Babylon 5: General<br>Date: December 21, 1995 4:07:17 AM</h3>
<pre>     Regarding "Legacies," there's one brief blip in there
that we're going to see  again; I'm not sure I'd call it a
clue, but certainly a cue...a hint of something to  come.  You
won't have to wonder what it is; it'll be shown in a flashback
in that  particular yet-to-air episode.

     What does the learning curve tell me these days?  That
I've got a LOT of  learning ahead of me yet.

     Re: season 3 scripts...I'm quite happy with them, and the
finished episodes.   I'd put on the top of the list for this
season (not necessarily in order) Messsages  From Earth, Point
Of No Return, Severed Dreams, Voices of Authority, Passing 
Through Gethsemane, A Late Delivery From Avalon, Dust To Dust,
and Convictions; they're real favorites of mine.  I suspect
that Ship of Tears and  Interludes &amp; Examinations will also
come out *very* well.
