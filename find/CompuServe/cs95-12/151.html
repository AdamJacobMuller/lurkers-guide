<h3>Section: Babylon 5: General<br>Date: December 29, 1995 9:30:19 PM</h3>
<pre>      &lt;Quoting Robt Martin to JMS&gt;:


      &gt;At the time you posted this, I took this as an expres-
      &gt;sion of your regard (or lack of  same) for the material
      &gt;that Fangoria covers, not regarding my ability as an
      &gt;editor.  Unfortunately, your semi-jocular observation
      &gt;is being parenthetically interpreted  as a blast at my
      &gt;abilities, for global distribution.
      &gt;
      &gt;Regarding my work at Fangoria, despite the fact that
      &gt;the magazine specializes in  covering some truly
      &gt;gawdfawful films, I remain proud of the work that I did
      &gt;there,  which only that magazine's regular readers are
      &gt;in a position to judge. Given your  apparent distaste
      &gt;for the magazine itself, I think I can safely assume
      &gt;that you only  know of my work as editor with regard to
      &gt;Sci-Fi Entertainment, specifically my  own interview
      &gt;with you, and possibly also my earlier piece on John
      &gt;Vulich's work.
      &gt;
      &gt;As I said, maybe I am being thin-skinned, but to have
      &gt;your words taken out of  context and interpreted in
      &gt;this manner is, if not of any real harm to my career, 
      &gt;really, really annoying. Can you please clarify the
      &gt;statement?
      &gt;
      &gt;If indeed you did mean to say that I am a lousy editor,
      &gt;so be it, but that is not what  I thought you were
      &gt;saying. Yet that is what is being sent about.

     No, the (regarding Mr. Martin's editing of Fangoria) was
mainly just intended  as a segue into the note about the
conventions being fun, since I've attended  several of them. 
I am not sufficiently familiar with your editing to *have* any
opinion whatsoever.  Since messages here are discreet, I
always try to keep  some kind of referential within the
message.
