<pre>"The themes of faith and forgiveness were worthy of a theologian. Are you
sure  there isn't something you'd like to tell us?"

     Never shoot pool at a place called Pop's.  Never eat food at a place
called  Mom's.  The difference between horses and humans is that they're
too smart to be on what *we'll* do.

     And I have lost people.  Too many people.  Lost them to chance,
violence,  brutality beyond belief; I've seen all the senseless, ignoble
acts of "god's noblest  creature."  And I am incapable of forgiving.  My
feelings are with G'Kar, hand  sliced open, saying of the drops of blood
flowing from that open wound, "How do  you apologize to them?"  "I can't." 
"Then I cannot forgive."

     As an atheist, I believe that all life is unspeakably precious,
because it's only  here for a brief moment, a flare against the dark, and
then it's gone forever.  No  afterlives, no second chances, no backsies. 
So there can be nothing crueler  than the abuse, destruction or wanton
taking of a life. It is a crime no less than  burning the Mona Lisa, for
there is always just one of each.

     So I cannot forgive.  Which makes the notion of writing a character
who CAN  forgive momentarily attractive...because it allows me to explore
in great detail  something of which I am utterly incapable.  I cannot fly,
so I would write of birds  and starships and kites; I cannot play an
instrument, so I would write of  composers and dancers; and I cannot
forgive, so I would write of priests and  monks and minbari....
