<pre>      Yes, B5 has a court system, authorized by the Earth Alliance
Judicial System,  to conduct trials of this sort (which we've seen
before).  And in this case, again,  there wasn't a trial per se as Ivanova
noted; he pleaded guilty from the start, quite  proud of what he'd done. 
So all that remained was the sentencing.
