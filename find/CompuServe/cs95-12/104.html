<pre>      &lt;Quoting Jason Wong to JMS&gt;:

      &gt;Just curious: is the season 2 ender going to be re-run?
      &gt;I noticed that it was  replaced with the season 3
      &gt;opener at the end of this batch of re-runs, and was 
      &gt;curious as to why.

     Actually, the season 2 opener was "Points of Departure,"
which wasn't rerun in  this batch, but rather "Hunter/Prey,"
chosen because it sets up some stuff in the  next batch of
episodes.
