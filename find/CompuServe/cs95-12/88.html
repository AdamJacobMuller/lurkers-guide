     We'd almost certainly go for tapes initially...videodisks
would mean  remastering all the film stock back to its
original aspect ratio, and we're talking  major bucks here.

<pre>      To get at the files, you have to follow these steps: use
the Install part of the  setup menu, which takes you to the
CDrom.  Highlight the files in the Images  directory.  Then
copy them into the correct directory on your hard drive.  Once
that's done, you then select the images you want.  Also be
sure that the image  categories are toggled on your setup menu
(personal info, battle info, images  (all vs. selected) and so
on.

     I've found that every once in a while, a video piece will
bump into my system.   What's weird is that I have two
identical systems, one at the work office, one at  home...on
the work office system, every single image works without
problem.  At  home, one of the images bumps into windows and
shuts me down.

     The best way to find out which is doing this is to
individuall select the areas  (i.e., first select just Battle
Info, or Geological Info, and de-select all the others in  the
setup menu).  Let those run through, and if there's not a
problem, try the next  one.  Since they go in order, you can
figure out pretty fast which one is causing  you a problem. 
I did this, and now my system at home works fine, after
omitting  one of the ship info files that, again, runs just
fine on the work system.
