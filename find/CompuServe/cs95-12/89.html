      {regarding using SW and ST doing well as an argument
       for getting B5 eps for sale on tape}

     Nope.  Doesn't work.  They see Star Wars and ST as
valuable commodities;  they don't see us that way because they
*know* us, and we're just a show of  theirs, one of many. 
This is the way it *always* goes, though.  On Star Wars, they 
gave away most of the merchandising rights because they didn't
think anybody  would want the stuff; on ST they canceled it
after 3 seasons and didn't bother to  protect the copyright on
the stuff for almost ten years (which is why they often  don't
prosecute stuff based on the first series that gets pirated)
because they  figured it was worthless.

     It's only LONG after the horse has left the barn that the
suits ever really  understand what they've got...or had.

<pre>     Yes, the ratings on WSBK have been up between a half a
point and a full  ratings point over where it was, now that
they've stabalized it.  Which is what  we've been saying would
happen for some time.

     This is probably the overwhelming problem we've had with
the few stations  that've been shuffling the show around...
they don't give it a stable time slot,  constantly pre-empt
it, put it on at 3 a.m., and say it doesn't do good numbers. 
Well, duh.  But as soon as they GIVE it a solid spot, even
if it's only for a little  while, the difference is noticeable
almost instantly.  And then it *does* do well for  them.

     What're you gonna do....it's Chinatown, Jake....
