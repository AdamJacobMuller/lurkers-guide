<pre>      &lt;Quoting Anita Karve to JMS&gt;:

      &gt;I'm glad Lyta made another appearance on the show. If
      &gt;you've seen some of the  recent threads, you'll know
      &gt;we're *dying* to find out what's going on with her and 
      &gt;the Vorlons.

     As it happens, as soon as I finish the two-parter, this
week, the next script will  get a lot more into Lyta and the
Vorlons and all that jazz.
