<pre>      No, the other brothers aren't mind-wiped.

      You're mis-remembering "The Quality of Mercy."  Telepaths do NOT
perform mindwipes.  A court appointed teep makes a scan before and after
for purposes of comparison, but the wipe is done by a device held under
lock and key until ordered out by a court.  The only reason Talia did it
in QoM was because they couldn't get a court teep there in the required
time (which was also stated in the episode).  So here the court appointed
telepath would have come and gone by now.
