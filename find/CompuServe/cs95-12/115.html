<pre>     Actually, the limited edition of Harlan's "City on the
Edge of Forever" script -- in  its various versions, outlines,
with postscripts by Nimoy, Koenig, Kelley, Takai and others -
is already out, and has totally sold out.  There will probably
be a  trade paperback version sometime next year.
