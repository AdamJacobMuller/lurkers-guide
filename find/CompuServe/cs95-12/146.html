<pre>      &lt;Quoting Philip Hornsey to JMS&gt;:

      &gt;We just had a *huge* shake up in affiliation down here
      &gt;(three stations swapped  Fox -- ABC -- WB) and I am
      &gt;afraid to guess at what it did to us. Have you any info
      &gt;on the state of B5 in the New Orleans market?

      Dunno how this is gonna shake out yet....
