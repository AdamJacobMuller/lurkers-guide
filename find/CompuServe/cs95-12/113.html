<pre>      &lt;Quoting David Belt to JMS&gt;:

      &gt;I want to say thank you.  I showed my 12-13 year old
      &gt;deacons "Passing Through  Gethsemane" on Wednesday
      &gt;night.  Other than my son (who is an avid fan),  none
      &gt;of them watch the series.  In fact, other than my son,
      &gt;all of them say that  they don't like the series at all
      &gt;(in the less than imaginative and colorful ways that 
      &gt;boys that age have of disparaging that which they have
      &gt;never tried.)
      
      &lt;snip&gt;
      
      &gt;The other adult present (who had never seen  the show)
      &gt;taught the lesson to the deacons quorum on Sunday and
      &gt;made several references to the show.  It was a great
      &gt;experience.

     Then perhaps the next sermon/lesson should be on the sin
of prejudging  something before actually being exposed to
it....

     Most interesting, and very encouraging to hear, thanks
for passing that along.   As an atheist, I'm always caught
betwixt and between when I hear about this kind  of reaction;
as a writer, I'm pleased.  So the two of us are going to go
 out behind  the house and slug it out.  Film at 11.
