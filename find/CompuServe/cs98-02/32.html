<pre> Kevin Kenney &lt;104102.352@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Can you verify this sneaky revelation?
&gt; Also, what is the genre for the optioned miniseries?
&gt; Mystery, horror, sf?
&gt; And it gives me pain to bring it up, but might you be checking
&gt; with Claudia's people to see if she is willing to be in at least
&gt; one of these last two movies at the available price? Or is that
&gt; situation still too painful?

      Two of the points I can't comment on; on the third, the original
miniseries I just sold is based on a true story about a year
researching some time ago.  I've been trying to find the right market
for a long time, and finally came across the right company, which
believes in telling this story. There's still mountains to cross before
it can get produced, lots of things can still go wrong, but now at
least a studio is involved and spending money, that's a big jump.

                                                                  jms
