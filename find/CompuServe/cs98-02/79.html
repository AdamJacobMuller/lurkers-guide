<H2>Acting Question</H2>
<h3>Date: 18 Feb 1998 12:45:14 -0700</h3>
<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; What do they talk about?
&gt; DO they have little script to follow?

      When there's no dialogue written because it will never be heard,
the actors just wing it.  Since it's all background stuff, from time to
time I hear it gets kinda...whacky.

                                                                  jms
