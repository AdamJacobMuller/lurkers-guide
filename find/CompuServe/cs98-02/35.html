      Yeah, I'm sure that some Minbari teeps could be trusted...but
would they function well in a covert situation?  They're mainly out in
the open.

      One other thing I forgot to mention in my note to Nancy...if you
put out the word that you want 2 teeps from each world...that kind of
kills any chance of putting together a group of telepaths that's going
to operate IN SECRET, a covert unit, yes...?

                                                                  jms
