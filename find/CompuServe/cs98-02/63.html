<pre> J_Graham &lt;74166.3727@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Where is the virtual shuttle that leaves every 10 minutes?
&gt; Is the BABCOM supposed to malfunction?
&gt; Also, though you may not be able to help with this one: How come
&gt; the Music CD won't play on my computer, though it plays in my CD
&gt; stereo system (note, other CD's play music fine in my computer)?

      Don't know the music answer...as for Babcom, yes, it's a broken
unit, which when you tap it with the mouse, allows you to eavesdrop on
bits and pieces of converstion around the station.

                                                                  jms
