<pre> Koslosky &lt;102365.2062@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I know you don't explain what's going to happen regarding B5, but
&gt; can you elaborate on this scene? When in time did this scene
&gt; occur, where, and what happened?

      No, as it stated in WWE, the point is to *prevent* that future,
which they did.

                                                                  jms
