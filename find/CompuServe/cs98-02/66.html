<pre> Dave Latorre &lt;76172.473@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; But tell me, was the "Bo and Mack get caught in the cross fire"
&gt; scene a wink in an obvious direction?

      Thanks.

"But tell me, was the "Bo and Mack get caught in the cross fire" scene

                                                                  jms
