<pre> Koslosky &lt;102365.2062@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; The Lurker's Guide asked the same question that was in my mind
&gt; after viewing this Ep - where was the Great Machine in all of the
&gt; desperate fighting? Twice now B5 has been in danger of destruction
&gt; (Zha-ha-dum was the first) and yet where was Draal?

      I don't think Draal wants to be bothered each and every time B5
is in a hassle.  He specifically said he wanted to be left alone. 
Otherwise you also get into a "god in the box" deus ex machina
situation where, "Oh, we're in trouble, quick, get Draal."  Truth is,
if they called him every time they got in trouble, he'd never get ANY
sleep.

      Now, if B5 had failed in stopping this advance force, and the
main fleet came in, then yeah, they might very well call him.  But this
was just an advance force, and she knew they could take it, and she was
right...so where's the need for Draal?  He should be a last resort
ONLY.

                                                                  jms
