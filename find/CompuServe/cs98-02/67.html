<pre> Ray Pelzer &lt;70475.1263@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; BTW, how long did the actors portraying Bo and Mack sit around
&gt; with you and Harlan in order to pick up on your respective
&gt; personalities?

      No, they didn't.  What they did do...they got along famously,
the two actors, and they spent their off-hours rehearsing the scenes,
over and over, until they got it down to a patter, very natural.  They
loved the roles.

                                                                  jms
