<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;75063.3305@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Why would she be angry with him if any of those other
&gt; possibilities were true? Was that planned on your part, or was it
&gt; just an accident?

      Who knows where this stuff comes from?  Sometimes I think it's
all being beamed into my head along with the Martian bozo-rays.

      One thing, however, is that I have *no* intention of handling
this in a conventional soap-opera fashion, because that's precisely
what will be expected.

                                                                  jms
