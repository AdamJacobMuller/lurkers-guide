<pre> PAUL SHEWARD &lt;100256.1563@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; How's your back Joe ??
&gt; Remember at Blackpool when you asked how many of us had seen
&gt; Season 4 episodes before Channel 4 had started the TV run ?

      The back is better...I still have to be careful, but it's
better.

      Nothing's been formally set yet re: the UK screening.

                                                                  jms
