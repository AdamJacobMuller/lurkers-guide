<pre> Scott J. Epstein &lt;71514.2733@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; But if the hypothetical Drazi teeps are Rangers, would they have
&gt; loyalty to the Drazi government, or to Entil'zha? And are there
&gt; any telepathic Rangers?

"But if the hypothetical Drazi teeps are Rangers, would they have

      Maybe they would..one hopes they would...but why take that
chance if you're in Sheridan's shoes, trying to make this thing work?

                                                                  jms
