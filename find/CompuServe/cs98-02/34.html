      He can learn, yes, and he can better himself...but because of
his actions, so many have died, so much grief has occured, that perhaps
no amount of self-revelation can cover the blood on the floor.

      There's an excellent moment in the Night Gallery movie, where a
prison camp commandant has fled to Brazil and, years later, is trying
to live out his life in peace, realizes that mistakes were made, is
actually trying to find a better life...but as one man dies at his
hands says, "You have hung too many Christs on crosses for any god to
forgive you."

                                                                  jms
