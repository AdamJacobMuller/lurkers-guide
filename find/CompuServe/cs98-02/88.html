<H2>which eye?</H2>

<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; What speculation has there been for what this signifies?
&gt; And when will we find out for sure?

      No, it's the left eye...trouble is, the patch, a rag, kept
slipping, and it's hard to read that part of it...but it's the same
eye.

                                                                  jms
