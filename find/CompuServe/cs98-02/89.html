"That sounds like a compliment to Angela Lansbury."

      Actually, it is.  After I came back from yelling at her
son/director, everybody was white as a sheet..."You're gonna be fired."
Within the hour she called me into her office (she was then exec
producer) and asked me what that was all about.  I told her, very
specifically, how I felt he had completely gotten the intent wrong on
several scenes, lost some clues, and otherwise was blowing it on this
one important sequence.  She listened, considered it, and finally said,
"You did the right thing."

      It was *extremely* classy on her part, and I've never forgotten
that. Never will.  It was a good example to me of how to conduct myself
when I got to this position.

                                                                  jms
