"1) Back in a college creative writing class my professor expressed
that a person would have to be either a fool, a genius or insane to
write a story from the POV of a minor charters.  Which do you consider
yourself?"

      Your professor's worst nightmare.

"2) Last week you pointed out that your writing credit was put up as
G'kar was talking about his muse.  This week it Mac was saying "Let's
go eat" when you credit was displayed.  Any comment?"

      It didn't mean anything that I could see.

"3) Can Zac arrest the Rough Cut guy?  He impersonates a doctor, and
