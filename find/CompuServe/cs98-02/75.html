<pre> Fred Topol &lt;76626.774@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; As a military officer, wouldn't one of Lockley's objectives be to
&gt; win any battle with the minimum amount of casualties?

      True, but is it *her* resource to do with any time she wants? 
It is a separate institution and operation, that has said, politely and
not terribly politely, that on balance it would prefer to be left
alone.

                                                                  jms
