      No, I might've been able to get a piece of Foundation, and I was
offered a piece of the new company set up to take over, but I declined,
on the theory that to make honest decisions, based on what's best for
the show and nothing else, I couldn't afford any other agendas...I had
to approach this stuff with, as Balzac said, "clean hands and
composure."

                                                                  jms
