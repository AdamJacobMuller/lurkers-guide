<pre> Scott J. Epstein &lt;71514.2733@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; This was really a writer's episode, wasn't it?

      The funny part of it is...the editors made a point of dropping
in my writing credit just when G'Kar says his muse is talking to
him....

                                                                  jms
