<pre> Philip Hornsey &lt;74053.2101@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; What is important is what are we going to do about it?

      That's fine, if this were a constitution or something based on
coming out from under an opressive government, as the colonies did. 
This is an incremental process; get the principles in place, and then
build the laws and the constitution on that.  Get them on board for one
thing they can sign, and then use that as a platform to get them to
sign the more restrictive stuff. And bear in mind you only heard part
of it; the full thing would go on for many many pages.

                                                                  jms
