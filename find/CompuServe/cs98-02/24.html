<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;75063.3305@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Was that wine I saw both Sheridan and Delenn drinking at dinner?
&gt; So I take it the minbari inability to consume alcohol went away
&gt; with her transformation?

      Nonalcoholic wine, at worst...I sometimes have it myself, since
I don't drink.

                                                                  jms
