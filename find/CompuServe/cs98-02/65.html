      I would suggest that maybe it's the luck of the draw.  I make it
a point, when the cards come out, of getting some regular boxes out of
the distribution line to check.  Although one was a bit light, in the
other two I checked, I got a complete set of the basic cards, and all
but maybe 6-8 of the chase cards, and one autographed card.  That seems
pretty reasonable to me.

                                                                  jms
