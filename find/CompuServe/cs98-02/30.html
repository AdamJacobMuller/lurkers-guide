<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; JMS, 1) was Mira told in seaon 1 about Delenn's role in the
&gt; Earth-Minbari war? 2) how long is a "cycle"?

      Remember though that the purpose of the teeps is to gather
covert intelligence.  There are two operative words there: covert and
intelligence.

      Intelligence against whom?  Logically, this would involve in
part keeping tabs on worlds not in the Alliance...and some that *are*
in the Alliance.  If you think the Drazi are up to something, and you
have Drazi telepaths on your team...are they going to cooperate against
their own government?  If you leave them out, won't they find out if
they're in the company of the other teeps on a daily basis?  The covert
part also goes out the door.

                                                                  jms
