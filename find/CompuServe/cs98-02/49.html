<pre> Richard M Perry &lt;76461.2737@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Just out of curiosity, when is your next visit to sunny Florida
&gt; going to be?

      Welcome back....

      Yeah, caught the Uncle Sam book, and liked it a lot.  I haven't
had much chance to read comics lately, but when I saw the Alex Ross
stuff, I knew I had to pick it up.  (Currently trying to catch up on
the Astro City arc.)

      Thanks for all that...it's a nifty little season.

      A 4.0 average?

      Listen to my voice...watch more TeeVee...you will watch more
TeeVee... you will forget all about Barnabas....

      Oops, wrong show.

                                                                  jms
