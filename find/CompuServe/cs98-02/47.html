<pre> Philip Hornsey &lt;74053.2101@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; One other thing, whose idea was the accent?
&gt; Didn't some bit player (Centauri Minister of Intelligence) once
&gt; say "the details are everything"? hey Joe...so how long *did* you
&gt; work for the CIA?

      We were open to accents and non-accents on all the roles...Peter
came up with one that worked.

                                                                  jms
