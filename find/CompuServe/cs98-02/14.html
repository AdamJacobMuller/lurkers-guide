<pre> Shane Shellenbarger &lt;104305.3404@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Joe, What are your feelings, now that the final episode of your
&gt; "brainchild" is stored in your computer, and nearing birth?

      I'm so caught between different emotions, I can't even begin to
sort them all out.

                                                                  jms
