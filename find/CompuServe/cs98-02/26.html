      He does tend to play Drazis a lot, primarily the ambassador, for
purposes of continuity, unless he's not available.

      Re: Hamlet...one of the wonderful aspects of Shakespeare's work
is that it lends itself to reinterpretation and reinvention; cynical
lines can be read with hope, and vice versa, and somehow, the darned
thing tracks.  One recent version of Hamlet mounted by Joseph Papp
starred a woman actor in the title role, and it worked beautifully.
