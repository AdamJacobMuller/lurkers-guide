<pre> Robert R. Wiggins &lt;76703.3036@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Does that include the credits?
&gt; Since I know credits are usually fiercely negotiated, was this a
&gt; magnanimous gesture on Peter's part, or did Andreas' agent kill
&gt; Peter's agent?

      No, Bill had a credit from the start; and each year, Andreas and
Peter trade off the last position in credits.

                                                                  jms
