<pre> Dan T. Davis &lt;71121.1254@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; It seems that the warrior caste of the Minbari is mostly male; or
&gt; have I just missed seeing the female members of the warrior
&gt; caste?

      It's more male than female, but they're there.

      (I can see it now...Xenonn, Warrior Princess....)
