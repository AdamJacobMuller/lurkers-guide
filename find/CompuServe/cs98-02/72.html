"Hmmm, wouldn't Draal likely be aware of what was happening so close
anyway? And would it not be possible that he may also be aware of how
strong the force was, how soon the white stars would arrive, etc, and
thus know if he was needed as a last resort?"

      You're not describing Draal, you're describing God, and he ain't
in this show.  For one thing, we couldn't afford him....
