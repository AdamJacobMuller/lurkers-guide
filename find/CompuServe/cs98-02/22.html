<pre> Rebecca Eschliman &lt;76072.2345@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Isn't part of clinical depression a sense of dislocation from
&gt; one's surroundings? Random Moments -- Sheridan's impression of
&gt; Mollari was delightful -- Garibaldi's "never met a fact I didn't
&gt; like" made me remember the "Deconstruction" byplay of "goodfacts"
&gt; -- your introduction of ambiguity in the stupidity of Sheridan's
&gt; decision vis-a-vis the telepaths foretold in "Deconstruction"
&gt; (was his mistake to allow them to live on the station, to allow
&gt; them to be used as info-operatives, or something we have yet to
&gt; see?

      A really very nice analysis of the themes and counterpoints in
the thing.  I hope somebody's collecting these things.

                                                                  jms
