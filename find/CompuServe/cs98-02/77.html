<pre> Darran Williams &lt;101656.2143@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; With this possibility of a UK screening of 'In The Beginning',
&gt; does a film print actually exist of the movie, as it's my
&gt; understanding that although shot on film all the post production
&gt; stuff, editing, fx etc is done on video?

      Not at this time, no, it'd have to be a video projection system,
same as we had for the cast and crew screening.

                                                                  jms
