<pre> Paul McElligott &lt;70007.3154@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; If TNT is showing episodes uncut, does that mean that the above
&gt; scene was deleted from the US broadcast?

      I talked to TNT about this, and apparently a technician plugged
in the wrong timecode for the act out.  Nothing more than that; nothing
else has been snipped, it was a one-time incident.

                                                                  jms
