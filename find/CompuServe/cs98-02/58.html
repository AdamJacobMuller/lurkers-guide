<pre> Rebecca Eschliman &lt;76072.2345@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; The main thing you show us in "View" is a change in perspective,
&gt; which is the inherent possibility of the holographic viewpoint,
&gt; no? Given that "View" was written much earlier, would you ever
&gt; have imagined that your "rumors" Bo &amp; Mack conversation (although
&gt; delightfully reflective of the whole
&gt; casting/cash/Internet-response dynamic)would wind up to be so
&gt; eerily concise a statement about the sate of our "ISN?" Who among
&gt; us would not be a better person for expanding their range of
&gt; acceptible possibilities?

      Thanks...as always, you catch all the nuances, and pick up on a
few things that I wasn't consciously aware of doing (the subconscious
is a sneaky, subversive thing that cannot be trusted).

      One of the things I always do is look for ways to turn the
series format on its head, and show us our characters from other
perspectives, since perspective is so much at the heart of the show. 
Whether that's jumping forward in time, or an ISN documentary, or
seeing everything through the eyes of a third party (or two), it's
always a risk, because it's never what one expects to see, and a lot of
people like to see what they expect to see.

                                                                  jms
