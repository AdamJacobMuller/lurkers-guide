<pre> Frank McCloy &lt;74541.3464@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is there any chance that B5 will be renewed for seasons beyond
&gt; Season 5 or have you written a definitive END to the series?

      B5 was written to end in year 5.

                                                                  jms
