      That might apply in a straight hierarchical organization, but
Garibaldi is not her superior; they are on parallel lines of command,
not vertical, he doesn't answer to her, she doesn't answer to him.  She
has total and complete authority over the station and is answerable
only to Earthdome and, in political matters, to Sheridan.

      You may not think this sort of thing happens, but it does, and
it would. You're talking to the only producer to go out and berate
Angela Lansbury's son who was then directing an episode of Murder, She
Wrote, in front of his whole crew, and still remain employed afterward.

                                                                  jms
