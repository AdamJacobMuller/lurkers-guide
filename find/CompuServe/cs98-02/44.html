<pre>{original post had no questions}

      Since you have now surfaced again....

      1) Photos were taken of myself, cast and crew at your behest for
a full print run, signed by everyone, for sale to benefit charity.  You
said that every person who participated would receive copies of this
photo.  To date, several of those involved, myself included, have not
yet received copies. When do you intend to fulfill your promise?

      2) These photos were to be sold to benefit charity.  Can you
supply me with the number of photos sold, and the amount of money
raised, and to which charity they have gone?  And how many others
remain in your custody?  As one of those who participated, at your
request, I have the right to this information.

      3) You have stated in the past that your books on charitable
donations are open to inspection.  I have now asked, at least half a
dozen times, for you to provide me with copies of that information. 
You said after my last request that it would take several months for
you to assemble that data.  It has now been almost a year.  I have not
yet received the promised accounting on this, or the prior Wolf
convention, where I participated to help you allegedly raise money for
charity.  When will this accounting be forthcoming?

      4) You have been repeatedly instructed not to show, or
facilitate the public showing, of episodes in the UK prior to their
official airing.  I am reminding you of your obligation not to do so,
or to use clips from said unaired episodes at your conventions.  If you
do so, I cannot be held responsible for the consequences.

      5) You stated that pirated merchandise would not be available at
the prior conventions.  Yet in both cases, substantial amounts of
illegal merchandise was being sold openly at your conventions.  Will
you, or will you not, honor your obligation to keep out illegal
merchandise in future conventions?

                                                                  jms
