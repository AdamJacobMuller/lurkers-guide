<pre> Dave Latorre &lt;76172.473@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; How do you keep things straight with so many threads and
&gt; characters over the course of the full arc? Babylon 5 has a
&gt; Cannon, but how does a written document account for
&gt; plot/character shifts over the years? Perhaps you have a vast
&gt; story board of post-it slips and yarn connecting push-pins to
&gt; keep things straight?!?

      This may sound kinda scary, but aside from my original notes, I
keep it all in my head.
