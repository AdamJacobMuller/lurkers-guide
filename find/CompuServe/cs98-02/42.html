<pre> Simon Grierson &lt;100407.2075@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; What do others think?

      Actually, having seen the original material (I was asked
initially if I would work on E:FC in terms of writing/rewriting the
pilot), there wasn't really a worked out arc on that; this is something
you can credit to the other producers currently working on the show.

                                                                  jms
