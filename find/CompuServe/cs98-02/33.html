<pre> Will Caraway &lt;73671.2434@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Which brings me to my question, did the Minbari, the Narn, or the
&gt; Centari also achieve the evolutionary state of the first ones?

      The Minbari eventually make it; the Narn and Centauri do not. 
They don't die out, they just don't hit a state of First One-ishness,
which is darn close to immortality (barring violence).

                                                                  jms
