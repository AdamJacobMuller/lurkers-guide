<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Just out of curiosity, knowing that the Voices of Authority track
&gt; was the only mostly original one on the 2nd CD, did you sort of
&gt; have it picked out as the S5 title 'just in case?'

      Yep.

                                                                  jms
