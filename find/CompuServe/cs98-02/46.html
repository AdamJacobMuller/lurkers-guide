<pre> Paul McElligott &lt;70007.3154@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Anything to this, or is it just a coincidence?

      It's been the luck of the draw, but yeah, Stephen has chanced to
do the lion's share of our off-format shows; I commented on this to him
not long ago.

                                                                  jms
