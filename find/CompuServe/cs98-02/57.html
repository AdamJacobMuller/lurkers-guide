<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; You just love that cavalry at the last minute thing dont you?
&gt; Where were the League ships at?
&gt; Same for Robin?
&gt; Did Bruce and John like the airship photos?

      They LOVED the photos; John in particular ooh'd and ahh'd over
them. They were big hits.

                                                                  jms
