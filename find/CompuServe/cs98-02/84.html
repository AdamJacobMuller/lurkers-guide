<pre> Kevin Mack &lt;75424.2124@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Did you feel that the medium was a bit of a constraint here?
&gt; Was this something you intended?
&gt; Was this the inspiration for Bester's label?
&gt; What other TV shows or films has he appeared in?
&gt; How closely did his voice match up to what you "heard" when you
&gt; created Kosh? How did you go about finding an actor who had the
&gt; vocal qualities you were looking for? 4) Have you had a chance to
&gt; see some of the better sci-fi features in the past couple of
&gt; years, such as "The Arrival" or "Contact", and what did you think
&gt; of them? What's your opinion of this series?

      The Lyta-outsider view was to further reinforce her on the
outside of the group...Ardwight looks just like Kosh only slightly
taller...thought "Contact" was better than "The Arrival," but enjoyed
both.  I actually don't get much chance to see movies at theaters, only
one in the last year, so I have to catch them on satellite.

                                                                  jms
