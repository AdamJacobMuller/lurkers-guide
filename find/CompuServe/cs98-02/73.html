"The "let them attack someone else, just not us" was actually a little
startling to me. If they were going to blow these guys up, I kinda
wished they'd put a little more effort into it rather than just
foisting them off onto the next, perhaps less-fortunate people."

      Given that this is a little-known, distant, entire *race* out
preying on weaker races, of which this was just an expeditionary force,
how (short of planetary genocide) would you have stopped them? 
Moreover, is that really Lochley's (or B5's) mandate, to eliminate
every hostile race out there?
