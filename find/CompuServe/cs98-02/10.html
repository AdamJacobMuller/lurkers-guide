<H2>G'Kar vs. Delenn</H2>
<h3>Date: 02 Feb 1998 23:20:02 -0700</h3>
<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Was it ever revealed why a member of the Kah'Ri was playing a
&gt; "lowly ambassador" on Babylon 5? Or is that something yet to be
&gt; revealed?

      G'Kar's position was widely known; the Kha'ri is a large group
like Parliament, as opposed to a 9 person, secretive ruling body.

                                                                  jms
