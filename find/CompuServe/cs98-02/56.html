<pre> Anthony J. Bryant &lt;71233.3035@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Does she not have any idea what Covert means?

      No, there's nothing secret in Garibaldi being head of covert
intelligence, any more than it's secret who the head of the CIA is. 
There was no reason she couldn't say that in front of them, or anyone
else; it's common knowledge.

                                                                  jms
