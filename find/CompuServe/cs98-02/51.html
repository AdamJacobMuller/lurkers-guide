      Entering rant mode....

      Of course the president screwed around...hell, it's one step
away from being a requisite for the job.  Every president does...what
the heck's the point of BEING president otherwise?  Some get caught,
some don't, that's the only difference.

      If you were to remove every member of the senate and house who
was screwing around, you'd end up with maybe a dozen people, including
Strom Thurmond, who *would* be screwing around except that the
necessary parts withered up and fell off 15 years ago along with what
little remained of his common sense.

      Frankly, I don't care who the president screws as long as it
ain't the country.  And right now, the country is doing better than
it's done in the last 20 years.  That's what will be noted in history. 
The rest is marginalia.

                                                                  jms
