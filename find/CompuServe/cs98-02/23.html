<pre> Tom Knudsen &lt;72347.1626@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Are any teeps the tactical/intelligence geniouses that Garibaldi
&gt; is? Do they have the charismatic leadership abilities of Sheridan
&gt; or Delenn? Can they heal people as well as Franklin?

"I wouldn't be surprised to see Byron realize that the mundanes have
talents that teeps generally do not."
