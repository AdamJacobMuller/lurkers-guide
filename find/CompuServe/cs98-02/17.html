<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;75063.3305@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; You thought we wouldn't notice that you cast G'Kar to play you,
&gt; did you? Are you referring to recorded human history here?
&gt; Wouldn't he really like to know how they feel?

      Byron's feelings about mundanes comes out later in more
detail...I wouldn't call it a hatred.  A resentment, yes, and certainly
there's a sense of having been mistreated...but he's surprisingly not a
violent person, as we'll find.

                                                                  jms
