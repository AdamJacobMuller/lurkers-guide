<pre> T.P.Chai &lt;104674.3064@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; JMS, 1) was Mira told in seaon 1 about Delenn's role in the
&gt; Earth-Minbari war? 2) how long is a "cycle"?

"1) was Mira told in seaon 1 about Delenn's role in the Earth-Minbari
war? coz Delenn looked like she was lying about something when talking
about the war."

      She was told some...but not all, only what was needed for that
scene: that she was holding stuff back.

                                                                  jms
