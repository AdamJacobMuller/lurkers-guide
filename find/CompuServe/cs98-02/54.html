<H2>Provoking Discussion</H2>
<h3>Date: 12 Feb 1998 13:00:00 -0700</h3>
<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Corey: &lt;&lt;If your style of provoking discussion is to say
&gt; outrageous things that you don't really believe yourself, please
&gt; let me know so I can refrain from responding.&gt;&gt; Vadim: &lt;&lt; What
&gt; would be the point of provoking a discussion if noone responds? 
&gt; What would be the point of answering a question with a question? 
&gt; What would be the point of disputing an outrageous opinion that
&gt; not even the poster believes? Bester as a "a nice guy"?
&gt; Goodnik?
&gt; Corey: &gt;&gt;RMES Minister of Cathode Ray Inspection and Appreciation
&gt; &lt;&lt; Vadim: What does it mean?

      Bester is NOT a nice guy...but not everyone sees him in that
light, which is why I did one episode from inside the Psi Corps this
season, to show how others in the PC see him....

      Even Hitler painted roses.
