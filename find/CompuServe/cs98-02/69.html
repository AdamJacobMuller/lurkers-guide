"Well, actually she still wouldn't discuss it in public."

      What public?

      These are two STATION PERSONNEL, who work for her, who are part
of the military command structure, who have the same loyalty oaths as
she has.  They didn't have this conversation in the Zocalo, in front of
civilians, it was in a closed area with two other STATION PERSONNEL,
who are entrusted with a high enough security clearance that they can
work on C&amp;C firing consoles during heavy action, in a situation where
every second counts in getting things ready for the next wing of an
imminent attack.

      This is a non-starter issue, frankly.

                                                                  jms
