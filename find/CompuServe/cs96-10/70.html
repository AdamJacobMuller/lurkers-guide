<pre> Scott Baker &lt;76072.1744@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; 1) Do you *want* to do a sequel?
&gt; 2) Or has your mind changed since the lurker guide posting?
&gt; 3) And more importantly, what is it that *YOU* want?

       I've always kept a separate B5 project in a different
pocket...yes, I'd love to do a B5 sequel if the story could be made
sufficiently worth doing. And the treatment that's been turned in could
well be that.  So we'll see.

                                                                  jms
