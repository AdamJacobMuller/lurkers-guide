<pre> Catherine Becic &lt;73414.2603@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Since you've switched to Melissa and the series will eventually
&gt; be on TNT, do you now go back and edit Melissa into the Season 2
&gt; episode and replace the other actress? Or will we still see the
&gt; switch of actresses when we see it again on TNT or eventually on
&gt; video?

      It's something we're considering; we had her do the entire
message, and shot Bruce in those sequences, so we have that option. 
Sort of a Soviet revisionism approach to television....
