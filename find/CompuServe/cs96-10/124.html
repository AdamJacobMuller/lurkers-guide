<H2>URGENT! HELP! from jms</H2>

      At this point (note to all who've emailed...there were so many
not everyone could possibly get a response), the system itself is up
and running again, having transplanted the DOS directory from my work
computer (an identical system) to the one at home.  I then used unerase
to restore the Windows and windows/system files.

      Alas, the only way to unerase is to give the deleted files a new
first letter or number...and I didn't know what they might be offhand
(there are something like 200-350 of them altogether in the windows and
windows/system directories), so I kinda had to rename them randomly,
just temporarily.  Now I have a list of the proper names of what the
files *should* be, and now I'm going through the long process of
matching them up and renaming them all.

      My virus scanners are all windows based, so once it's up again,
I'll be able to go looking around a bit more.

      Thanks to all who've helped.

                                                                  jms
