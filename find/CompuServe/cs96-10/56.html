<pre> Hart Trevor &lt;100705.1222@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Can you please tell me what is going on?

       I don't know...all I know is that while I'm at Necronomicon in
Tampa, they've got me doing an IRC on Saturday.  I'm not any more
involved than that. Don't know any of the details.

                                                                  jms
