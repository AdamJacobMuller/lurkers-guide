<pre>      It's a funny thing...just to show you how sometimes even jms can
be just a LEEETLE bit slow on the uptake....

      I've known, at some level, for four years that we're a
syndicated show, that we don't have the usual network censors to deal
with.

      Then, this season, it finally hit me..."waitaminnit...we don't
have CENSORS!  As long as it doesn't use the words you absolutely can't
say on TeeVee, as long as it doesn't directly involve nudity or blood
and guts, I can take things *CONCEPTUALLY* as far as I want."

      Heh.

      Heh-heh-heh....

                                                                  jms
