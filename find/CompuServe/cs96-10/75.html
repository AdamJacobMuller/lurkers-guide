<pre> Jonathan Kass &lt;74130.443@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; which leads me to ask - is "The One" literally Ranger One?
&gt; Or more figuratively the "Sole Leader" of the Minbari?
&gt; And then Valen was "The One" who was, Delenn (has now become/is
&gt; becoming) The One who is, and somehow we are to assume Sheridan
&gt; will someday become Ranger One?

       Entil-Zha, whoever that is at the time, is for all intents and
purposes the One for the Rangers.

                                                                  jms
