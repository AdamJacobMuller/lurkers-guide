<H2>Z'ha'dum - sneaky!!</H2>
<h3>Date: 01 Oct 1996 12:55:22 -0700</h3>
<pre> Alan Mulvie &lt;100566.1444@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Shall I sample it and upload it to the forum, incase some
&gt; technician has been mucking about behind your back? Maybe ol'
&gt; glowing eyes is back?

       I've checked it, and I think it was just the actor sliding a
vowel to make it clearer; "if you go to Z'ha'dum (ah) you will die."

                                                                  jms
