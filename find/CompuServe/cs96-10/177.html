<pre> Boris -pH7- Molodyi &lt;70322.624@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Which makes me wonder: why didn't Shadows surface right in the
&gt; middle of refugee ships, and do their job, rather than coming out
&gt; at what seems to be considerable distance, and thus opening
&gt; themselves to attack by the Army of Light?

      Just answered this twice in another thread...would hate to take
up the space repeating it a third time....

                                                                  jms
