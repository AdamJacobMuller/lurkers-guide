<pre> Robin L. Small &lt;76640.2012@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; yes??
&gt; That wouldn't happen to be a piece of a vorlon or being "with
&gt; child" would it???

      No, that replied to his promise to come see Delenn...which in
the flurry of events he forgot until she was already in the chrysalis.

                                                                  jms
