      What might be interesting, next time you pick up the book, is to
fire up a copy of "The Coming of Shadows" and go through it with the
script in hand...it's a good way of seeing how you lay out a show
shot-for-shot.  And since there's stuff there that was cut from the
episode, you can also judge on what was left out, and why, and whether
it hurt or helped.

                                                                  jms
