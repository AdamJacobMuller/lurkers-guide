<pre> Michael Beemer &lt;71551.1670@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; The question is - why are points on net *still* being offered?
&gt; Are there enough rubes who go for it to make it worth a try for
&gt; the studios? Are they largely ignored if the other provisions of
&gt; the contract are sufficient? Is there a "prestige" factor to being
&gt; offered 5% of nothing as opposed to 2% of nothing?

       Yep, they're still offered...and taken...because it's important
to at least keep the *concept* of profit alive, however bastardized the
form.

       Fr'instance...I don't have a gross profit percentage of B5.  I
have a small *net* profit.  Which, as we all know, means I'll never see
a *dime* out of it.  The only part where I have a piece is an (even
smaller) percentage of the gross is in...merchandising, the one area in
which I've dragged my feet from day one.

       My accountant thinks I've got it in for him....

                                                                  jms
