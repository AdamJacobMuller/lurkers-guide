       Valen only knew what Sinclair would've known.  Zathras wasn't
speaking from what Sinclair had told him, but on the basis of things
he'd figured out on his own.

       Re: the new Kosh...yeah, the look is intentional.  I worked
with Optic Nerve to get the new lines right, messed with their sketches
until I had what I wanted.  It's very effective in some lights, less so
in others, but the sense comes across.

                                                                  jms
