<pre> Richard M. Perry &lt;76461.2737@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; So, how did you like you first trip to Fla?

       Florida was fine...except that the on-and-off laryngitis I came
down with while there morphed into an upper respiratory infection which
I'm fighting off as best I can...on top of everything else that's been
going on.

                                                                  jms
