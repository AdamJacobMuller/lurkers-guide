<H2>BABYLON 5 SEASON FINALE</H2>
<h3>Date: 21 Oct 1996 13:43:54 -0700</h3>
<pre>{original post had no questions}

       Here's how to work this out, for the earliest possible start
date for S4 in the UK.  This may not be what actually works out, I'm
not committing C4 to anything here, only indicating the *earliest* it
could theoretically be done.

       We finish shooting May 5th.  It takes about 52 days to finish
post production on a given episode.  Figure 2 months, round it off. 
That's July 5th for delivery on 422.  Maybe add a week or two just to
allow for glitches. So now July 19th.  We have to allow C4 to go
through the episodes for censor purposes, and that takes about another
couple/three weeks, so now we're at the end of July/first week of
August.  That becomes now the earliest you can conceivably air 422.

       So now you just do the math: 22 weeks from the first week of
August would mean that March 10th or 17th would be the absolute
earliest that the show could debut.  If they wanted to build in a
cushion to prevent any possible conflicts, then the ideal date would be
around the first week of April.

       But, again, I don't speak for C4, or their prior scheduling
committments, I'm just backtracking to when it would be feasible from
a production standpoint.
