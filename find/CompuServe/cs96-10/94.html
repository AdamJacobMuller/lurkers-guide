<H2>URGENT! HELP! from jms</H2>
<h3>Date: 17 Oct 1996 03:39:54 -0700</h3>
<pre>HELP!  I got zapped tonight!  Someone sent me what they SAID was a
picture his kid made of a Starfury, said it'd be great if I could say
an encouraging word or two about it.  So I downloaded the file, and it
turned out to be a booby trap.  (No, I can't trace back the user, it's
off the internet, and the address was an anon...didn't write it down.)

Anyway, it DELETED MY DOS DIRECTORY and started to delete my Windows
directory as well before I caught it at the last moment.  (Yes, it was
a com file, and I stupidly didn't look to check before activating it
with the newsreader's program.)  I've managed to restore nearly all the
Windows directory (except for win.exe which is utterly gone).  I used
Norton to do that part...but Norton Unerase only seems to work in a
directory that's still there.  The DOS directory is completely *gone*. 
Is there any way I can restore it?  I can try moving the DOS directory
from my work computer to the home one (they're the same systems, and
arrived within days of one another, so they should be nearly the same),
but I'm obviously leery.

When it runs through my autoexec.bat file, I get the following errors:

Bad or missing C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE

Bad or missing C:\DOS\HIMEM.SYS

(I figure those'll come back after DOS is restored, but I'm less sure
about the other ones following:)

HMA not available; loading DOS low

Bad or missing COMMAND interpreter Bad command or file name Bad
command or file name

(I'm not altogether sure that's from autoexec. or the config.sys file,
by the way...could be either.)

This isn't the sort of thing I've ever had to deal with before, and
will take ANY advice from someone knowledgeable.  I have scripts to
write, and this is a major problem for me right now.
