       There's a time bomb built into B5; instead of the usual 7 year
options, we only took 5, building a hedge against our own greed.  If
this show as it stands now were to go past 5, everyone would be able to
renegotiate...actors, subcontractors, suppliers, everybody.  At which
point it would be too expensive to produce anymore.

                                                                  jms
