<pre> Scott Baker &lt;76072.1744@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I have to ask, what nigtmare did these things come from?
&gt; Also, where did you come up with the strategy, was that your own,
&gt; or did you get some suggestions or did you look into history?

       I dunno...I just thunk it up as efficient and ruthless.  I
guess it comes naturally when you're a producer.

                                                                  jms
