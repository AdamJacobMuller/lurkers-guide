<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Since Sinclair knew that the Warrior caste would refuse to get
&gt; involved in the current war, and have problems with having humans
&gt; in the order, why didn't he leave control of the Rangers to the
&gt; religious caste?

       Because *at the time* the Warrior Caste *was* involved, and it
would've been a slap to them to do so.

                                                                  jms
