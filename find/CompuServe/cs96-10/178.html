<H2>Second B5 CD</H2>
<h3>Date: 28 Oct 1996 19:57:37 -0700</h3>
<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Is the second music CD still scheduled for release at the same
&gt; time as season 4, or has it been pushed back again?

      It's being released in November, but I hear they won't sell it
to you because they say you're too loud.

      Me, I don't get involved in these things.

                                                                  jms
