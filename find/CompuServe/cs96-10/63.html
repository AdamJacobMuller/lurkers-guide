<h3>Date: 09 Oct 1996 22:56:28 -0700</h3>
<pre>      A couple of quick notices:

      1) I'll be in Tampa, Florida this weekend for Necronomicon, held
at the Chamberly Plaza Hotel and thereabouts.  I'll be bringing
bloopers, clips from upcoming shows, and other Cool Stuph.

      2) My "Complete Book of Scriptwriting" is now hitting the
bookstores, in a totally rewritten/updated and expanded version.  It's
$21.99 from Writer's Digest Books.  Some interesting B5 stuff there....

                                                                  jms
