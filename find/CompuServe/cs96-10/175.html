       Actually, no, most refugee ships are NOT jump capable. 
Remember, it takes a LOT of power...you've got the heavy cruisers, and
long range exploratory vessels, and not much else.  That's what makes
the White Star so special, that it can be as small as it is and still
generate a jump point. The Asimov class passenger liners, for instance,
can't jump, and have to rely on gates.  The smaller ships the refugees
would've been using would have had to get to their local gate, and then
line up to go through it in small groups. Which means 85% of them
would've been trapped there, ducks in a shooting gallery.
