      Yeah, Vir has to be *very* careful...he's on the razor's edge
these days.  The higher up you go, the more you know, the higher the
stakes and the greater the risk of choosing badly.

      Re: "funny yet chilling," those are the scenes I love most...the
ones where you're utterly conflicted, it's grotesque or frightening on
the one hand, and comic or absurd on the other.  It leaves you
uncertain which way to jump emotionally, and I love that
feeling...caught betwixt and between.

                                                                  jms
