<pre> Mike Robison/ WA &amp; FL &lt;71361.1440@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; From what you said, I infer that writing is a similar
&gt; "relaxing/unconscious" process for you, when you are *on*...OTOH,
&gt; are there still days when writing seems similar to staring at the
&gt; keyboard until drops of blood appear on your brow?

      It never gets easy...it just gets difficult in different areas.

                                                                  jms
