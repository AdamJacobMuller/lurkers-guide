<pre> Juanma Barranquero &lt;100044.2131@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt;  - Why did you use Jack the Ripper as a character?
&gt; I mean, are you fascinated by the story of JtR (as many of us
&gt; do), or simply you used him for dramatic effect?

       I used Jack because he was perfect for that particular job,
which was what the Vorlons had decided as well.  Simple as that.

                                                                  jms
