<pre> David Schirmer &lt;76774.3310@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Do you know who the Artist will be?
&gt; And do you know how many plates there will be in the series?

       Can't remember the artists offhand, but the plates will feature
each of our major characters in turn; Sheridan is first, then Delenn,
then I think we've got Ivanova, Londo, G'Kar, others.

                                                                  jms
