<h3>Date: 23 Oct 1996 18:20:45 -0700</h3>
<pre> Brian Kornfeld &lt;75703.1340@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Why would G'Kar even attend this meeting, given his hatred of
&gt; Londo and his mistrust of all Centauri? Why would G'Kar trust
&gt; Londo, even for a second?

       I think that if Londo sent word via the Babcom unit that he
wanted a one-to-one with G'Kar, and that thousands of Narn lives were
on the line, he would come.  G'Kar has nothing to fear from Londo as
long as he's on B5...and if anything, I think he'd be amused if Londo
did try anything.

                                                                  jms
