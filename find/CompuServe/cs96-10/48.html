<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Is the Minbari warships strong enough to go one-on-one with the
&gt; Shadow vessels? Since the White Star is a hybrid Minbari-Vorlon
&gt; ship, does that mean that the Vorlons are cooperating with the
&gt; Rangers?

      The Vorlons were cooperating in the recent past, yes, and it
still takes a couple of Minbari cruisers under most circumstances to
take out an immobilized shadow vessel, though one can do it if the
firepower is concentrated and prolonged.

                                                                  jms
