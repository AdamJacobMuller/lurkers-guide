       You mention how ST brought people into the SF fold who
nominally hadn't been there before...I've been noticing much the same
phenomenon at the conventions I've been attending.  Even at the most
recent Necronomicon, the number of people over what the convention
normally gets (there were about 700 over their normal attendence) was
almost exactly equal to the number of people who came there strictly
for the B5 stuff...and the majority of them, from what we could
determine, had never been to a convention before, and for the most part
weren't into other SF shows...many didn't watch much TV at ALL except
for B5 and a couple others.

       You can see the new group sort of sliding itself into the
larger "melting pot" of fandom.

       Interesting to see the pattern repeating.

                                                                  jms
