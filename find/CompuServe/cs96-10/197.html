<pre> Rebecca Eschliman &lt;76072.2345@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I'm going to make an assumption here, but you put a little too
&gt; much (of yourself) out there for your own comfort? As far as
&gt; storytelling, which is why we're here, can you put too much out
&gt; there of pain, joy, fear, yearning, resentment, relief, etc.? 
&gt; Stripped of those elements, doesn't the story become antiseptic
&gt; and liable to lead to indifference in the viewer/reader?

      Yeah, it's primarily a personal comfort issue.  It's kinda like
standing naked in front of ten million of your best friends....
