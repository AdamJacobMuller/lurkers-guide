<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Is this true?

      Correct, Foundation is now doing EFX for Voyager.  I wonder how
some ST fans who put down B5's effects, saying ST's never-go-CGI
approach made them a better show, will react to this.

                                                                  jms
