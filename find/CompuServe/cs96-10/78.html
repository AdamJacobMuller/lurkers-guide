       Yep.  I wanted everybody to fall for that "oh, he's a standard
good guy, hero model type" approach...then yank their blankets, and
deeply intensify the character.

       Glad it worked.

       "I had no idea you meant that literally!"

       And sometimes, I'm being far more straightforward than it would
appear. Because I know everyone overlooks the most obvious stuff.

                                                                  jms
