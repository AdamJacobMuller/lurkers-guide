<H2>URGENT! HELP! from jms</H2>

<pre>{original post had no questions}

       To know how to rename all the hundreds of files in my
windows\system directory, is there any way to save to a file all of the
file names in my directory, so I can bring that one file home with all
their names?  (I know, I should do a print screen, but the printer here
at the office is broken, and I'd have to hook up another one from
another office, which is a pain.)

       Also, how does one uncompile a .com file?  I think I caught the
Trojan Horse before it did anything else, but I kinda want to open it
up and look inside in case it did anything else I should know about. 
Don't want to go through all this and get another surprise in a few
days.

                                                                  jms
