<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; What is it, and will it be available in the UK?
&gt; Also, when you are writing B5, are you, in a sense, reporting
&gt; what you see in your mind (so that B5 continues when you are not
&gt; looking, so to speak!), or are you each of the characters in
&gt; turn?

       "The Complete Book of Scriptwriting" is out, yes, and can be
ordered from the UK via Writer's Digest Books, or www.amazon.com.

       And yes, the characters do somewhat live in my head, and I
check in with where they are at various points, and write it down. 
It's very weird.

                                                                  jms
