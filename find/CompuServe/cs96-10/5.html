<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Is "Walkabout" the first new episode back from the long reruns?
&gt; I saw it on dish but wondered if new shows started the week
&gt; before?

       No, Walkabout is the first of the final 5 held back from year
3.

                                                                  jms
