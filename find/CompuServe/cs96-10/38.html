       Again, I think we're more on the same side of the issue than
not...I'd just point out a very basic truism that does, or should,
matter.

       If producers are more aware of SF novels, and SF writers, they
will likely option more properties for film and TV.  If they're not,
they will option fewer.  That's an absolute loss of income to SF
writers.

       But it's their business, not mine.

                                                                  jms
