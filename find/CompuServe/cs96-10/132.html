<pre> Mark McGehee &lt;75720.2420@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Now that Sheridan is openly searching for Telepaths, will we find
&gt; out in a future episode what happened to the 100 Telepaths who
&gt; were rescued in "Ship of Tears?"

      Yup.  Basically, they're still in cryo as Franklin keeps
working.

                                                                  jms
