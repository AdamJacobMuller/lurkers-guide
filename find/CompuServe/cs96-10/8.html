<H2>&lt;&lt;Z'ha'dum&gt;&gt; - a query</H2>
<h3>Date: 01 Oct 1996 12:55:26 -0700</h3>
<pre> Mark Sloan &lt;100407.3462@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; So, who or what were piloting the Shadow vessels which were seen
&gt; on Mars? More 'servants' (like the one seen - or rather NOT seen -
&gt; in 'LD')? Was anyone guarding the Shadows while they slept?

       Yes, they had some of their servants and allies taking care of
things; whenever a signal was sent, and a ship found, they'd dispatch
one of the standby ships to go and pick it up, slowly regathering their
forces.

                                                                  jms
