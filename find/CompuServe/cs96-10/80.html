<pre> Nina K. Berg &lt;102461.2104@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; When did Delenn first know that Sinclair was Valen?
&gt; Does anyone besides those who were on the White Star know that
&gt; Sinclair was Valen?

       She had suspicions starting from the Battle of the Line; we'll
have more on that later.

       Yes, the Grey Council knows, but the general Minbari population
does not know.

                                                                  jms
