<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; So.......Is Morden toast or what?
&gt; Was Sheridans wounds from the Shadow that he was shooting at or
&gt; from a fight with Morden and Co afterwards?? I thought someone
&gt; else was going to die? Did you mean Anna?
&gt; Did you see " A Close Shave" yet?

      Yes, have seen and enjoyed "A Close Shave."

      No comment for now on the rest.

                                                                  jms
