<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;75063.3305@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Speaking of the new season, what episode is filming currently?
&gt; And which one(s) are you finishing up post work on these days?
&gt; Do you still feel good about all of them?
&gt; Do they still have that "film" quality of which you spoke
&gt; earlier?

       Yeah, feel great about the new eps.  We're currently shooting
#6, and we have scripts in hand through #10.  We've delivered 1 and 2,
and will finish the audio mix on 3 next week.  John and I go in to edit
3 on Wednesday.  The feel of it is quite extraordinary.

                                                                  jms
