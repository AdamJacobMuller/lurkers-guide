<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Why didn't they just jump in right on top of their targets and
&gt; started blasting away?

      See my other note on this.  And, again, it isn't a settlement,
it's a gathering of ships.  The other note explains in more detail.

                                                                  jms
