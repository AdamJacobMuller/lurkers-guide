<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Why didn't they just jump in right on top of their targets and
&gt; started blasting away?

      So they could drive any other ships toward the center, into the
killing zone.  If they come in into the center, everybody splits in
every possible direction, and that makes running 'em all down harder.

                                                                  jms
