<H2>Season 4 Title</H2>
<h3>Date: 28 Oct 1996 18:16:50 -0700</h3>
<pre> Martin Shaw &lt;101642.505@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I was wondering if you have decided on a title for series 4 yet?
&gt; Have you released the details of the opening narration yet?
&gt; Or are you planning on leaving this to the conference next
&gt; weekend? in the UK?

       The main title will reveal itself soon enough; and yes, I have
a title for the season.

                                                                  jms
