<pre> Terrill L. Burlison &lt;73631.275@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Do you mean you downloaded it from a Newsgroup?

      Unfortunately, I didn't write down the information, the poster
said his address was on the jpg, so I didn't bother...and when it
activated, the whole system went kablooey...it's my own stupidity,
that's all.

                                                                  jms
