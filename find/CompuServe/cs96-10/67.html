<pre> Kevin P. Kenney &lt;104102.352@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; BTW - how are the effects coming along?
&gt; Was the transition reasonably smooth?

       The new CGI effects are stellar (as it were).  I defy *anybody*
who doesn't know the difference just from knowing what's gone before to
tell the older shots from the new ones.  (We've always reused some
shots, usually establishers and the like.)  I sure can't tell them
apart.

                                                                  jms
