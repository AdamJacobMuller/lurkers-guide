      There's no perceptible difference between the establishers from
before and after, except that the newer ones are somewhat more
detailed.  This increase has always been there each season, but we've
often used stock from prior seasons in non-critical shots...it blends
seamlessly.

      And yes, I feel *very* fortunate to work with the people here.

                                                                  jms
