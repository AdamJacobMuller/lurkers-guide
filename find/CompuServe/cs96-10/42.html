      What's the HOA?  Don't recognize the acronym...unless you mean
Homeowner's Association....

      Re: "Walkabout," thanks...of the final 5, it's not at the top,
but it ain't bad.  If you happen to be out of the house this coming
Thursday, and miss "Grey 17 is Missing," you miss a little, but not a
lot.  It's okay.  But the ones after that are just *killer*.

                                                                  jms
