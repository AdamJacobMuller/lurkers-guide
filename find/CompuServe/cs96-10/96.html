<H2>URGENT! HELP! from jms</H2>
<h3>Date: 17 Oct 1996 18:11:36 -0700</h3>
<pre>{original post had no questions}

       I'm going to take the command.com file off one of my rescue
disks that I made for this computer (alas, they can't restore the dos)
and my hope is that that'll be clean.

       And now the kicker.

       There's also a text file in that directory that wasn't there
before. It contains 3 words.  STAR TREK RULES!

       Fortunately, I caught it before too much damage was done.

                                                                  jms
