<pre> Marte Brengle &lt;76703.4242@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; No backup?

      Thanks.  Alas, some of my backup was on a Zip drive, but I
couldn't use the Zip without Dos being present, so I was basically
screwed.  At this point I've got the Dos directory restored (using the
files from the twin computer at work), and so far it *seems* to be
okay...but it also screwed up all the files in the windows system
directory, and now I've got to go through, restore and rename all of
them, and since I don't know offhand what they all are, it's going to
be a slow process.

                                                                  jms
