<pre> Michael Beemer &lt;71551.1670@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; One has to wonder, if the Zarg was so doggone dangerous, and such
&gt; a perfect preditor, how did they catch it and transport it to the
&gt; station in the first place?

      There was a line about slipping the egg into the station...don't
remember now if it made it through the edit or not.

                                                                  jms
