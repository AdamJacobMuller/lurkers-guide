<pre> Tom Knudsen &lt;72347.1626@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Are you saying that Susan's psi powers won't really be a factor
&gt; in the story?? Wouldn't that tend to go against the gun over the
&gt; mantle rule??

      Only if one assumes everything applies only to the Shadow war.

                                                                  jms
