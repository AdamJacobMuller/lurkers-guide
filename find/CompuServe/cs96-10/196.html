<pre> Al Lipscomb &lt;75204.2225@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; 5) Why were the Shadows and the Vorlon left behind by the first
&gt; ones? Punishment?
&gt; A desire by the two races to prove a point?
&gt; Something in their nature that made them want to stay?

      Well, most of that is on track....
