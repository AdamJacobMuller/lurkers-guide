<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;75063.3305@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; When you're done, could you let me know (generally, of course
&gt; :-), how you feel it came out?

       They're all coming out nicely...very different feel this
season, which takes some getting used to, but overall, very very nice.

                                                                  jms
