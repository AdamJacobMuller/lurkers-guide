<H2>Rock: Lord Refa?</H2>
<h3>Date: 18 Oct 1996 01:02:24 -0700</h3>
<pre> Colin Glassey &lt;104224.2227@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; 1) Why won't Lord Refa bring his own people?
&gt; Is he over confident?
&gt; Is he actually weak on man power?
&gt; They also are letting the last member of the Ka'Ree escape from
&gt; Narn? But here, these Centauri guards, are going to just walk away
&gt; and let Refa be killed by NARNS?!? The sort of character that
&gt; doesn't show up often (fortunetly) but without great vilians,
&gt; what chance is there for great heroism?

      Bear in mind that all of Refa's people were *back on Centauri
Prime*. He didn't bring them with him; to send word to Centauri Prime
to bring them all the way out here, then on to Narn, would double the
time required to get there, and by then the "rescue" would've been
over.  That was part of Londo's scheme...he wouldn't have much time, he
had to get in and get out.  Refa only brought a few with him, and they
were needed to watch Londo and guard Vir.

      As for the Centauri back home...you proceed from the assumption
that all Centauri act as one.  I'm basing this somewhat on the early
Roman civilization and government, where one side would sell out the
other, arrange for deaths and murders, turn people over to their hated
enemies as long as it advanced their position, or if they were allied
with persons of power on a particular side.  Why did the Roman guards
escorting Tiberius (a much less worthy emperor) kill the heir to the
throne in "I, Claudius" (a much better leader, and well liked among the
military)?  Because they were told to do so.

      SF in TV has the tendency to portray aliens as monolithic...they
put the good of their species as a whole above everything else.  Some
do that; some do not.  Just as with humans.

                                                                  jms
