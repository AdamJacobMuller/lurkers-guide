      Actually, the more I think about it, the more I like the idea of
Zathras as a political speechwriter or candidate.

      "Zathras look at budget deficit, says, not good.  Stop spending.
But no one ever listen to Zathras.  But one day, everybody listen. 
Then, Zathras elected.  Zathras will be great president.  Someday even
have face printed on money.  Then, everybody have Zathras face in
pants.  It is good to be president."

                                                                  jms
