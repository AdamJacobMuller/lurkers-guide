      I cannot give authorization, it's not mine to give, it has to
come from Warner Bros., as part of a license.  And while you are not
getting paid for it, the users *are* paying for access to CIS for the
game, and that is a large part of where you're getting into trouble.

      I understand that your error is one of enthusiasm, nothing else,
and I appreciate the enthusiasm...but understand that when I say WB
will get upset about this, they *will*.  They've done it before, and
shut down at least one other sim group, maybe more.  I'm basically
trying to steer you clear of trouble, and there's no way to do this
without a license.

                                                                  jms
