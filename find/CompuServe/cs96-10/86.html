<H2>Scripts available?</H2>
<h3>Date: 16 Oct 1996 11:57:32 -0700</h3>
<pre> Michael Beemer &lt;71551.1670@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Are you involved in making this decision?
&gt; If not, who are you to say?

       It's a moot point...yes, you can scan in a script, but a) only
if you have access to it, and b) you still have to go through massive
amounts of work making sure it's all properly spaced and laid out.

       As of now, "The Coming of Shadows" script is available in the
new edition of my scriptwriting book, so that's a start.

                                                                  jms
