<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: June 23, 1995 1:28:29 AM</h3>
<pre>     That's good to hear.  Last I'd heard was the possibility 
that Ch4 might air all four remaining year two eps *the same 
night* on July 25th, in kind of a B5 marathon.  Good in 
one sense, though if you miss that night, you miss it all.  
Here, spreading it out as usual, is probably better.
