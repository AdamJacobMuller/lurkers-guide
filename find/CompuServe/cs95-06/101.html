&lt;Congratulations!  All of us in the Star Trek graphics 
department are excited that we'll get to enjoy another year of B5.

Your renewal is good news not only for those of us who are B5 
fans, but also for television science fiction in general.

-Mike Okuda&gt;

      Thanks, Mike.  You (and the whole graphics department there) 
have always been a class act.
