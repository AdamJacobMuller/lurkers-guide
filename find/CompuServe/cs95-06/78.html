<pre>     While I won't presume to speak for DS9, no, in my view,
B5 is not "simply a futuristic version of Gunsmoke."

     The mission in Gunsmoke was simple: protect the town from
those nasty outlaws.  The marshall wasn't off trying to forge
peace treaties between soldiers and native americans, the
story wasn't constantly being affected by political events
in Washington; the town was isolated, out of context.
B5 is in part *about* context.  The premise in "Gunsmoke" is
presented in the first episode, and you never really go
anywhere from there, it is what it is.  Not the case with B5.

     There are few clearly defined good guys and bad guys.
Londo started out comic relief; he's become a tragic figure...
G'Kar started out as the bad guy, has ended up as a heroic,
possibly doomed figure...in "Gunsmoke," Miss Kitty wasn't
revealed halfway through to be a carpetbagger, but we have
no such boundaries.
