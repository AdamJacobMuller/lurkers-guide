<H2> What --Persecuted??!!		</H2>
<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: June 09, 1995 2:37:11 AM</h3>
<pre>     Here's the funny thing...every, oh, six-nine months or so, 
I get phone interviews from major magazines asking, "So, to what 
do you attribute this sudden boom in science fiction?"

     Each time, I tell them the same thing: "There AIN'T no boom, 
nor is there anything to attribute it to.  You've got 35 network 
dramas on; that's business as usual.  You've got 5 SF shows, that's 
a *boom*?  Further, most of the shows fall by the wayside fairly 
quickly, and in a few months you'll be doing articles about "Why 
won't SF work on TV?" and calling me on that one."

     Not one magazine or newspaper has ever printed that part of 
the interview.
