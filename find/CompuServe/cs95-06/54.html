<h3>Section: Star Trek<br>Date: June 10, 1995 7:14:12 PM</h3>
<pre>     Paramount does not actually *have* a creative side; neither do
most studios.  They are business operations that make deals with
creative people who create programs and movies under their unbrella.
Studios are made up of presidents and vice presidents and
directors in charge of media affairs, business affairs, legal affairs,
publicity and promotion, marketing, on and on.

     The creative people at ST aren't a problem, any more than we
are a problem to them.  When either show does a particularly nifty
looking show, for instance, our EFX people call theirs, or theirs call
us, to say so.  I have nothing but undying respect and admiration
for Jeri Taylor and many others over at ST.  Whenever there's a
problem it can usually be tracked down to one of the Suits.
