<pre>     The problem is the medium.  If an artist wants to do art
in the form of paintings, he needs canvas, paint and a subject.
If an artist wants to do art in the form of television, he requires,
oh, about $22 million, give or take.  In the case of ST, closer
to $39 million, figuring $1.5 million per show, which is actually
on the low side.  That's per season.

     When you've got THAT much money riding on it, plus in the
case of ST, literally *billions* of dollars in revenue from
merchandising...well, you begin to understand why things happen
the way they do sometimes.

     We're *trying* to set a better example.  Many producers
putting new SF shows together have come to us, and we've given them
tours of our stage and facilities, explained how we do what we do,
and many of them are now using the "Babylon 5 Model" in putting
their shows together for the networks and studios.  As far as I'm
concerned, the more the merrier.
