<pre>     Argh, unfortunately the disk is in storage, and I don't 
have the number at hand.  You may want to try the Lasercraze 
laserdisk sales service here on CIS; they may have it.

     I've heard something very interesting about the UK 
airing for the final four eps (year three beyond has been 
renewed there).  I hope to have something very positive to say 
shortly.
