<H2> Babylon 5 Theme Music		</H2>

<pre>     Yes, we'll change the theme again.  The theme and narration
changes with the theme and part of the storyline we're entering.
Some don't like the year two theme as much as the 1st because it
doesn't summon up the same feelings; it shouldn't.  It's a
different chapter in the story.  I've already spoken with Chris
Franke about my ideas for the music for year three, and I think
it'll be pretty kick-ass.
