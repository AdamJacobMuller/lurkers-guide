<pre>     It's really sad, but...see, on the one hand, I like filet 
mignon, and occasionally lobster, and all the other hoity-toity 
foods you're supposed to like and eat when you're a TeeVee 
producer, but see...I hate even to admit this in public, but...
I actually kinda *like* McDonald's burgers.  I don't know why, 
but there it is.  I usually end up ducking into one 
when I'm by myself, because the explanations...well, you see my 
problem.
