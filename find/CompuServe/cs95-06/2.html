<pre>     In talking to a number of scientists and physicists 
about sound in space, they came back with the realization 
that the area isn't as black and white as first thought.  
(Did you know that when the Pioneer probe broke the speed 
of sound in space, it registered a shock wave across its 
bow, a sonic boom that was monitored by JPL?  I didn't.)

     As for making the starfield rotate...because of the 
size of the window in C&amp;C, the starfield outside is about 
60 feet by 30 feet.  You cannot rotate something that size.  
If you put a smaller field nearer the window, it's visible 
for what it is.  We've gone over this, believe me.
