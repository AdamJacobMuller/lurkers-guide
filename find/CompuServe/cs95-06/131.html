<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: June 25, 1995 9:10:31 PM</h3>
<pre>     For those interested, Harlan Ellison has a new recording out 
via the Harlan Ellison Record Collection, cost $16.50 &amp; $2 
postage/handling for the general public, $15 &amp; $2 for members of 
HERC (the Harlan Ellison Record Collection, which for a paltry $8 
per year you get a newsletter, updates on what's available, access 
to his books and prior recordings).

     The new CD is his performance/reading of "Paladin of the Lost 
Hour," which many of you may remember from its adaptation into 
an episode of "The Twilight Zone."  It's a *terrific* reading, 
very dynamic, and if you've never heard Harlan read one of his stories, 
you're missing a lot.  (One prior recording was nominated for a 
Grammy.)

     Checks or money orders can be sent to: The Harlan Ellison 
Record Collection, P. O. Box 55548, Sherman Oaks, CA 91413.
