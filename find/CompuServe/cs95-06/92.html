<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: June 16, 1995 6:39:18 PM</h3>
<pre>     Of the four remaining episodes, 1 was delivered about 
a week and a halfor two weeks ago (which would air second 
in the batch).  The episode thatwould air first was delivered 
yesterday.  The episode that airs third willbe delivered today 
or Monday.  The final episode will be delivered in in
about 7-10 days.

     So to recap:

       episode 1 - delivered
       episode 2 - delivered
       episode 3 - Monday
       episode 4 - 7-10 days

     And that's all of it.
