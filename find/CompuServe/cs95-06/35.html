<H2> B5 vs. ST			</H2>
<h3>Section: Star Trek<br>Date: June 10, 1995 12:50:07 AM</h3>
<pre>     "Paramount HAS increased the avenue of approach for more
SF/fantasy by CREATING the market with TNG."

     The only thing wrong with this statement is that it isn't true.

     ST creates a market for more ST, nothing else.  As one who has
had to speak with just about every network and studio major domo
on this subject, the overwhelming concensus has always been, "The
market isn't big enough to sustain more than one SF series, and
that's Star Trek."  From time to time, grudgingly, one or the other
tries it, but almost always half-heartedly.

     I heard that line scores of times in the process of trying to
sell B5, which is one major reason why it took 5 years to sell it.
If what you say were true, then there should have been dozens of SF
space series by now. But there aren't.  There's only us, and we had
to work hard to overcome the ST-Is-The-Only-Marketable-SF problem,
combined with Paramount's little games (making sure we're relatively
invisible to Entertainment Tonight, getting Stephen Furst kicked off
a guest-shot on the old Arsenio show to avoid promoting B5, and other
little tricks I could go into).

     None of which is to say that ST is bad, or that the people who
make ST are bad, this is Paramount stuff.

     But we had to fight hard to overcome the stumbling blocks put in
our way that are part and parcel of ST, so you will forgive it if the
hairs on my neck stand up when someone CREDITS the development of
shows like B5 to ST.  It is absolutely, positively not true.
