<pre>     I've only seen one episode of The Tick, and loved it.
Favorite scene: a Bad Guy has a friend, which is really a
sock puppet over his hand, which he operates with minimal
skill.  At one point, when the Tick doesn't appear, the
sock puppet says, "He's off sulking like Achilles in his
tent."

     (blank stares from all the other bad guys)

     "Achilles."

     (blank stares)

     "Homer.  The Illiad.  The Odyssesy."

     (blank stares)

     "READ A BOOK!!!!"
