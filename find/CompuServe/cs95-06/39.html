<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: June 09, 1995 8:50:10 PM</h3>
<pre>     We lose as often as we win at softball, but invariably we get a
much larger turnout of B5 people to cheer on our team (anywhere
from 40-60, as opposed to, oh, usually 20), and we have a much
better time, I suspect.

     Interestingly, when came time to create our B5 softball
jerseys, we gave them all the same number: 5.  So you've got an
announcer saying, "At shortstop, number 5...first base,
number 5...second base, number 5...."

     There were some initial complaints, but on checking
the rule books, there's nothing that says the numbers have to be
different.  So the 5s stayed.

     We had a previous shipment all with #4, but it vanished
mysteriously.
