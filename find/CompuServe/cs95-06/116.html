<pre>     I think you've confused several things.  We're talking 
about the events in "Parliament of Dreams" in which a ritual 
she goes through with a bunch of other Minbari is referred to as 
a) a rebirth ceremony, which sometimes doubles as a b) marriage 
ceremony.  It was a rebirth ceremony in this case, presaging 
"Chrysalis."
