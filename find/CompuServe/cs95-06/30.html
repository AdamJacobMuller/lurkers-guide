<pre>     You have to step back and look at this from Paramount's 
perspective. For 27 years, they've had a lock on space-based SF.  
A monopoly.  They could point to all the other space-SF series 
which went by the boards quickly, and say, "See, we've lasted, so we 
MUST be better."

     If even ONE other show in this genre not only lasts, but 
*succeeds*, then ST isn't the Only One anymore; it's just one of 
two, or three, or more shows set in this genre.  It isn't 
unique (fiscally) anymore, and thus they are afraid they'll lose 
some of its marketability, the franchise will weaken.  If you wanted 
something from our future, in space, then for 27 years you had only 
one place to go: Trek.

     They're *terrified* of losing or softening their franchise.  
They're aware that support for DS9 is, in general, fairly soft;
 Voyager is still getting its sea legs, and they don't want 
anyone else coming up alongside and blindsiding them.

     For our part, we have never responded in kind.  When we 
formed the B5 softball team, playing other shows, we happily 
told the folks at ST that we'd love to play them sometime.  
Thus far, no response.  Can't imagine why.
