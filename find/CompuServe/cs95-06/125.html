<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: June 22, 1995 3:20:25 PM</h3>
<pre>&lt;The Sysops have posted again the warning about story ideas not 
being brought up in the forum, along with the reasoning.  They 
used as an example a storyline about a person who had been mind-
wiped and then recovered his memory which you were (supposedly) 
developing but tossed after it appeared in this forum.  I was just 
curious: was that a "B" story, or did you have to make changes 
in the arc to accomodate the loss of the story? Please tell us 
what you can.&gt;

     It was always intended as a B-story, mainly a character story 
about the person who was affected, and how that would affect our 
main charactes when they found out about it (it's someone they would 
have known for a bit).
