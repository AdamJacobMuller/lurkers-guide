<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: June 03, 1995 3:24:25 AM</h3>
<pre>     Yeah, I get confused sometimes.  Here's why:

     At any given point, while we're doing the show, 
I'm working on thefollowing episodes *SIMULTANEOUSLY*:

       I'm writing show #1
       I'm getting the director a copy of script #2
       We're prepping script #3 for principal photography
       We're shooting script #4
       The director is editing episode #5
       John Copeland and I are doing the producer's cut of 
       episode #6
       We're doing the music/sound EFX spotting of 
       episode #7
       Visual EFX/composite shots are coming in on 
       episode #8
       We're doing the final audio mix of episode #9
       We're delivering episode #10 to Warner Bros. 
       for closed captioning.

     In the course of any given day, I run from one of 
these to the other,to the other, to the other.  After 
a while, EVERYTHING blurs.
