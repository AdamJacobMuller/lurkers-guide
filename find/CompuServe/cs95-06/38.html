<h3>Section: Star Trek<br>Date: June 10, 1995 12:50:09 AM</h3>
<pre>     What I've said, repeatedly, is that I don't believe for a
second that either of the creators behind DS9 would deliberately borrow
*anything* from anybody.  What I *don't* know is the extent to which
the development people at Paramount, who did have the B5
material, may have influenced that development without them necessarily
knowing the origin of the notes.

     But frankly...it's old news.  There were striking similiarities
between the DS9 pilot and ours; however, since then their show has
gone on into very different areas, and the similarity has diminished
further and further until there's almost no remaining comparison.
So for me, that aspect is really not a major factor anymore.
We move on.
