<H2> B5 vs. ST			</H2>
<h3>Section: Star Trek<br>Date: June 10, 1995 7:14:09 PM</h3>
<pre>     "Before Star Trek, there had NEVER been any attempt to bring
serious science fiction to weekly television."

     Well...not exactly true.  THE TWILIGHT ZONE did much to
bring serious SF to American television, as did many episodes of THE
OUTER LIMITS.  LOST IN SPACE ended UP as campy, but in the
beginning, in the black and white episodes, there was actually
some pretty decent stuff.  Ditto for THE TIME TUNNEL, the
Quantum Leap of its time.

     Just for purposes of clarity.

     Which is not to devalue ST, nor should it be construed
as such.  My sense is that the original ST was kind of like
the Beatles; both were very much products of their time, both
created something of a watershed for the form in which they worked,
both are unique in their respective histories. Every so often,
some new group is held up as the new Beatles; and every so often,
some SF show is held up as the new ST.  Both fail to see the
point, or put the source in its proper context.  The job is not
to be the "next" ANYthing; it's to be its own creation.
