<H2> From JMS: B5 Renewed		</H2>
<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: June 09, 1995 2:16:00 AM</h3>
<pre>     To confirm word already leaking out via John Copeland on 
AOL...yes, we received word that BABYLON 5 has been renewed for 
its third season.  I got the call this evening, and have spent 
the time in-between doing Producer Stuff, and taking care of a 
small bug that hit last night, and has thus taken a bit of the 
edge off the news.

     Nonetheless...we've been renewed.  Shooting on year three 
will begin around July 31st. This season will put us past the 
halfway mark on the series total.  Expect Big Things and 
some major changes not just in characters, but the structure of 
the B5 universe itself.

     And now...to work.  With thanks to all of our friends on the
 nets who have stood beside us through the last two years.
