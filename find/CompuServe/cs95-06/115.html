<pre>&lt;Therefore, wouldn't it make sense for the Vorlons, whatever 
Rangers have gathered, maybe the Narn (whatever's left - it 
would've been better if they attacked before the war started) 
and Delenn's friends in the Mimbari (there's got to be some) t
o pound the heck out of the Shadows now, before they're ready?  
If someone blew up Z'Hadum, it seems that would deal a serious 
blow to the Shadows' plans.&gt;
     The forces you describe are not sufficient to take out the 
shadows, even at this stage.  It's going to take a much larger 
force, which is what Delenn et al are trying to gather.
