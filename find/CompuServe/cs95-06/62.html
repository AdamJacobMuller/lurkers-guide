<pre>     At 66 episodes, we will have enough to syndicate, yes, though just
barely.  About 100 episodes is preferred.  It makes our position both
stronger and more vulnerable: stronger in that we're now a player;
more vulnerable in that, at some point, if somebody gets fed up with
us, they can drop the show and recoup their investment in syndication,
which they couldn't until year three.

                                                                jms
