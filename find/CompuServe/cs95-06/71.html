<h3>Section: Star Trek<br>Date: June 11, 1995 9:38:25 PM</h3>
<pre>     Two corrections: there *is* a planet nearby Babylon 5, 
Epsilon 3, to which they've traveled before, and will again.  
Also, while B5 does not have a wormhole, it does have a 
jumpgate beside it.  Both nominally function in a similar 
capacity, allowing long-range travel.
