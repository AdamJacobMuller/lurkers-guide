<pre>     I quote your message &lt;&lt;From another poster&gt;&gt; *verbatim*, 
word for word:


"I spoke with one of the CMC Organizers today (Harold) and he 
said the reason Walter Koenig hadn't received his check was 
that he changed his address and didn't notify CMC of the change.  
They FedEx'd his check to him and got it back as undeliverable 
because the address was no longer valid.  Since FedEx doesn't 
get address forwarding information like the Post Office does, 
they could only return it to CMC.  CMC now has received Walter's 
new address and the check has gone out (he may even have it now)."

     The only problem with your message is that it isn't true.  
Walter has never changed his address.  What happened (I just 
verified this on the phone with Walter about, oh, 3 minutes 
ago) was that the deadline for his check passed.  He called CMC.  
They said it had gone out.  It didn't arrive.  He called again.  
They said there was some kind of mistake, and they'd send it again.  
Again, no check.  Finally, Walter insisted that if the check did 
not arrive by Wednesday, he would have to withdraw from the 
convention, and to send the check directly to his home.  Now, 
finally, under threat, the check arrived.

     To say that he changed his address is completely untrue.  
To say he didn't notify CMC of a change that didn't happen is a 
shameless and transparent fabrication.  From reports I've heard, 
CMC has a habit of playing "the check's in the mail" with people.  
Lying doesn't help.
