<pre>     On the flip side, virtually *all* of the B5 fans are
also SF fans as well.  That's because, ratings-wise, we're
still hitting mainly the hard core SF audience.  Where ST
gets its ratings is from the mainstream, non-SF fan community.
Should B5 begin to mainstream out, then that would change.
