<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: June 13, 1995 1:13:13 AM</h3>
<pre>     DC is, we think, acting precipitiously.  Current
discussions seem to be moving toward extending the book
another six issues to allow time to find its audience.
More as this is locked down.

     Problem is, DC is cutting back titles left, right
and center, leaving mainly the superhero stuff.  And the
comic biz right now is in a major tailspin overall.
