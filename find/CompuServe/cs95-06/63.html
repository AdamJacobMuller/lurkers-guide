<pre>     Of course they always point that &lt;b5 not in syndicated neilsen
top 20&gt; out.  They also conveniently forget that the majority of those
20 shows are sitcoms, entertainment newsmags, game shows and the like.
I got the latest ratings summary, and as I recall we were the number
4 dramatic series for the week in question, and the number 6 rated
dramatic series for the year.  That ain't bad.

                                                                jms
