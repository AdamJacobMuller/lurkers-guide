<H2> Babylon 5: Hard SF &amp; B5		</H2>
<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: June 26, 1995 10:46:05 PM</h3>
<pre>     Then please explain to me why it was that, when the 
Pioneer space probe passed the speed of sound while in 
space, the monitoring station at JPL registered a shock 
wave -- a sonic boom -- across its bow?

     Also, fuel of any kind that exerts propulsion, 
spewing forth substance to push it forward, puts forth 
a medium behind it capable of carrying sound. When some 
satellites have been launched from the shuttle, 
the crew have heard or felt the engine thrust.

     Further, a ship carries atmosphere within it.  If that 
ship explodes, the sound will be audible within the curtain 
of the expanding atmospheric bubble created by the rupturing 
of the hull.

     The idea of *no* sound at all in space is one of the
great shibboleths of SF.  But in talking to many leading 
space scientists, including some at the High Altitude 
Observatory, and none other than Freeman Dyson, who currently 
occupies Einstein's chair...ain't necessarily true.
