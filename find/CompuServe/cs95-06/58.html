<pre>&lt;Can PTEN make a station which owns a show run it if it doesn't?&gt;
     Not insofar as I know, no.  If the fans in the area want the show,
they have to bug the station to show it, or give the rights to another
station in the area.  This happens frequently, btw, to other shows.
In some cases, a station might acquire a show not because they want
to show it, but because they don't want the OTHER station to have it,
and since syndication is almost all on a barter situation, they don't
have to pay much to get the show, so they lose nothing.
(This happened to us on the syndicated Twilight Zone, in some cases.)
