<H2> Talia Leaving B5?		</H2>
<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: June 04, 1995 7:15:15 PM</h3>
<pre>     Just for purposes of clarity, what I said in my note was in 
response to a message alledging that Warners had influenced us to 
drop the Talia character, at which point I noted that this had never, 
ever happened, and that they were, if anything, only vaguely aware of 
the character in any event.  There have never been any discussions of 
ANY kind about Talia with Warners.
