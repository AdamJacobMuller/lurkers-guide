<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: June 25, 1995 11:10:27 PM</h3>
<pre>&lt;I heard a quotation that made me think of Delenn, and of her experience in
Confessions and Lamentations.  I believe that this was from the Gospel of
Phillip:  "Spritual knowledge springs from an awareness of our own capacity
for evil."  Does it seem to you that this is meaningful?&gt;

     Not bad....
