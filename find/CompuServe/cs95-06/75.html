<H2> What --Persecuted??!!		</H2>
<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: June 12, 1995 10:08:16 PM</h3>
<pre>     The others just sort of mumbled.

     One other person in the focus group started going on
about how he doesn't like women characters who aren't *women,*
which by his lights meant he felt there should be more
passive, motherly figures, that somebody like Ivanova
shouldn't be running a station, didn't like her at all....

     Then there was a THUMP in the room that startled
everyone on both sides of the glass.  Without even realizing
I'd done it, I'd picked up the nearest pencil and thrown
it at the glass.

     Odd that I haven't been invited back since....
