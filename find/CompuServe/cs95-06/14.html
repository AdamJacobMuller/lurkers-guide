<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: June 03, 1995 3:14:16 AM</h3>
<pre>     I'm almost finished with the revisions on the writing book; 
it's been hell because it's a total rewrite from stem to stern,
and I'm adding about 200 pages of new material on top of 
correcting all the info that is now out of date.  It's a big 
honking piece of work on top of doing the show, but it's almost 
done.
