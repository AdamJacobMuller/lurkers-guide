<H2> B5 vs. ST			</H2>
<h3>Section: Star Trek<br>Date: June 12, 1995 1:10:25 AM</h3>
<pre>     Though your sentiment is good, and your heart is in the right 
place, I don't think a treaty will do it, simply because there are always 
new people coming and going, and going and coming ("and always too 
soon", Blazing Saddles).  Also, I'm not sure it's appropriate to 
ask everyone to admit to something that has not yet been 
demonstrated, whatever my own personal feelings about it might be.  Who 
would sign it?  Who would implement it? Would Japanese car sales be 
factored into the equation?

     And, fundamentally, as stated, it's old news.  At this point, 
what matters is not how the series got ON the air, but what they're doing 
now that they're ON the air.  The marketplace of free ideas is the 
only fair and accurate judge of such things.

     I think what has you upset, and sometimes upsets me, is 
when one does have the occasional member of the ST fan community roll 
in and yell about B5 being a ripoff of DS9...when B5 dates back 
to 1987, which can be verified in any number of places, including 
published interviews and books.  So naturally it causes one 
to wish to hit back in equal measure.  And while I will correct a 
mis-statement when someone quotes me inaccurately on this subject, 
I'm not really sure that's the way to go.

     If I had to turn to the Star Trek community, and express 
a concern, it would be only this.  Gene Roddenberry advanced the 
idea of IDIC.  Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combinations.  It is 
another word for open-mindedness. Because Babylon 5 is on the air, 
it does not constitute a threat in any way to Star Trek.  One is 
no more disloyal to ST by checking out B5 than one is disloyal to 
the original Trek by watching a show using the same name but in 
no way created by the creator of Trek (Voyager).

     We are not Trek.  We have no obligation to be Trek.  Nor, 
really, do I think anyone would want us to be Trek, because then we 
*are* irrelevant and redundent.  We are another view of the future.  
It's not the same as the Star Trek future, but another possibility...
which of course gets us into philosophical areas, and some of the 
objections some ST fans have toward B5 are, indeed, philosophical; 
this is how they want the world to be 250 years from now.  
Fair enough, and I don't have a problem in the world with that.

     I have no problem with ANYone who gives B5 a fair shake, and 
then decides it's not for them; anyone who actually *embraces* the 
idea of IDIC and practices it; anyone who gives B5 the kind of fair 
chance that ST fans wish would've been given to the original show 
back in the 60s.  Yet all too often, when someone comes into the B5 
section on a kamikaze run, after they've dropped the bombs, you 
discover that, in fact, they've never seen the series, never seen 
more than some promos, or two minutes of a show; the same people 
who will, by their own statements, stick with a new Star Trek 
series, even though they hate aspects of it, for whole *seasons* 
until they figure out how to get it right.

     There is NO reason for animosity between ST fans and B5 fans, 
for the simple reason that, every day, we gain more fans who 
began as ST fans, and in many cases CONTINUE to enjoy that show.  
Any hostility is as fundamentally silly as fans of Hill Street Blues 
declaring open warfare against anyone who likes NYPD Blue because 
they both have the word Blue in the title, and HSB was there 
first.

     All that anyone wants, I guess, is that the show be given 
a fair chance.  The lack of that chance was what helped drive 
the original Star Trek off the air after two years initially, 
and finally after the third.  I can't see any reasonable 
ST fan, knowing that history, and decrying it, then doing 
it to another.

     Interestingly enough...I saw Roddenberry once, at a 
presentation he gave in either Glendale or Pasadena, around 
1983 or so.  He screened "The Cage," and spoke afterward.  
The one thing he emphasized, over and over, was this: 
Follow your dream.

     STAR TREK was Gene Roddenberry's dream.  His vision.  
He labored long years to bring it to fruition.  
He galvanized the media fan community (sometimes to 
the exasperation of Lost in Space fans).

     BABYLON 5 springs from the same roots.  Since 1987, 
it has been my dream, my vision, to see this story 
produced.  It's not done by committee, it's not done 
by suits or execs.  It's done by me, and the breathtakingly 
talented people who work for me.  It is as pure 
and personal a dream for me as Star Trek was for Roddenberry.

     Mutual regard in that respect, at least, while not 
blinding either side to the genuine flaws or achievements 
of either show, would seem to be the way to go.  IDIC.
