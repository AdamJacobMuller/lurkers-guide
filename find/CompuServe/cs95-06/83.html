<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: June 14, 1995 2:50:18 AM</h3>
<pre>&gt;&gt;Talia Winters is either getting killed off or thrown in jail 
back on earth.  She is the one who tried to kill Kosh at very 
beginning of show.  In real life, the actress who plays her and 
the actor that plays Garabaldi are engaged!!!  The shadows 
attack the Narn home world and do major damage.  Vir is getting 
killed off.I wonder if their sources are reliable.  
We will see..............&lt;&lt;

     I'd say overall that's the most breathtakingly jumbled 
batch of half-rumors and quarter-truths I've seen.  You can 
disregard, oh, 98% of it.
