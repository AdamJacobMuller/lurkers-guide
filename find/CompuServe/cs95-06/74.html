     Well, how about a major change in the very
structure of the B5 universe?

     How major?

     Imagine if, one day, the Enterprise crew discovered
that their ship had actually been constructed by the Romulans,
and that they were morally obligated to go off and serve the
Romulan empire...and that didn't change at the end of the
episode, it *stayed* that way for the rest of the season.

     That scenario bears *no* resemblance to what I have
planned for year three, so there's no point in riffing off
it and looking for clues.  But that is emblematic of the
Major Event waiting about halfway through the third season.

     How's that for a start?
