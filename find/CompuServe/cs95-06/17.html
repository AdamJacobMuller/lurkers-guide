<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: June 03, 1995 9:08:19 PM</h3>
<pre>     My two novels and my anthology are currently out of print; 
have also had short stories in Amazing, Pulphouse, Shadows 6 
and the like.  The book I'm trying to finish is the update to 
my scriptwriting book from Writer's Digest.
