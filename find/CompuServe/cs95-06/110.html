<pre>&lt;A question, unrelated: Did Sinclair ever marry Catherine?
(And who came up with the proposal, you? It was so in-character 
it was absolutely perfect!)&gt;
     No, he pushed back marrying Sakai when he was reassigned.

     And yes, the proposal was mine.  If my name is on the script, 
every word of it was written by me.
