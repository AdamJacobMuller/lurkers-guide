<pre>     A canvas painting of a starfield won't work, because the light 
inside C&amp;C is so bright that a painting wouldn't register through 
the window (it's like trying to look at the stars through the 
window of a brightly lit room). We have a star curtain with *fiber-
optic lights* that create the stars.  You try and rotate something 
with 500-600 delicate fiber-optic lights, and it's going to be 
constantly breaking.  Also, 30 by 50 is fine *horizontally*; the 
second you try and rotate that, you suddenly have something 50 feet 
HIGH, and the ceiling isn't big enough to accommodate that.  (It's 
wider than it is high currently because most of the angles we shoot 
in are left/right, not up/down.)  If you shorten it for the ceiling, 
it won't be wide enough.

     Similarly, a projection onto a screen outside wouldn't show 
through the glass, either.  It would also require a length for proper 
rear-projection that would eliminate space badly needed for our sets.

     Believe me, we've been over this and over this...there have been 
hundreds of suggestions...none of them work.  Except for when we blue-
screen in a starfield, there's 
nothing else to be done.
