<pre>      Thanks.  Yeah, the idea of getting out of this part of 
the Biz and back into novels or plays is very appealing.  
The pace would be FAR less difficult, you write at your own 
pace, there aren't 250 people standing behind you waiting for 
pages.

     I've been writing, first part-time, then full time, 
since I was in high school.  Full-time since about 1979.  
3,000 pages a year.  Writing twelve hours a day, every day, 
except my birthday, my spousal overunit's birthday, christmas a
nd new year's.  By the time B5 is finished, I think I could well 
use a slightly slower pace...maybe sit by a nice, quiet little 
stream for a while, feed the ducks....
