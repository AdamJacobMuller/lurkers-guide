<pre>     I never much went in for Skinner.  When I went into the 
psychology department initially, everything was Carl 
Rogers, non-directive therapy, and RET.  Then somewhere along 
the line Skinner took over, and by the time I transferred to 
SDSU, it was all over for everything else.  Here's how bad it 
was: I took a seminar in "Theories of Psychology."  All that 
was taught that semester was Skinner.  Toward the end of the
term I asked why.  "Well, there are many theories of psychology," 
I was told by the instructor (who was also the department 
chairman), but it seemed better to teach you the *right* one."
