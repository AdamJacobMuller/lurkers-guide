<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: June 07, 1995 10:40:27 PM</h3>
<pre>     That's probably one of the best analyses I've seen on the 
progress and history of the show(s).  As Dupa says, you may want 
to consider posting this over on ST, though I'd maybe re-emphasize 
that this *isn't* a flame (it obviously isn't that in context, but 
it never hurts to reinforce it for those who just skim).  Certainly 
it should lead to some interesting discussions, as long as it 
doesn't turn into a "yeah, well MY show is better and yours 
SUCKS" fest, at which point it's better left to die of its own 
weight.

     Certainly Paramount has gone out of its way to make life for 
us difficult.  Getting Stephen Furst bounced off the Arsenio show 
back when it was still around because they didn't want to promote 
B5; making sure that Entertainment Tonight mentions it as rarely 
as possible; naming their new PI show "Babylon," presumably to
confuse the marketplace even further (suffice to say we encouraged 
them to rename it, and that's been done); word that has come to us 
from stations that program mangers were told that if they wanted 
Voyager they had to drop B5...there are more examples.  But that's 
what Paramount does.

     But we're like Rasputin.  Shoot us, poison, stab us, drown us, 
hang us...we just keep going.
