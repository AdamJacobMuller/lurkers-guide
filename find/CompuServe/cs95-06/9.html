<pre>     I think that if people paid extra for VIP tickets to get 
workshops, and those workshops are now free, certainly should be 
credited for that.  And for anything else that's not delivered.

     Re: your question about cast fees...I spoke with Walter 
Koenig today,who was supposed to receive the lion's share of his 
fee within no less than 30 days of the convention (by contract), 
and still hasn't received it.
