<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: June 09, 1995 8:50:07 PM</h3>
<pre>     If every dedicated B5 viewer got 10 people who haven't
watched/don't watch the show, and got them to just watch the episodes
in October and November, it'd probably have a salutory effect on
 our ratings, and given what's in those eps, we'd have them thereafter.
