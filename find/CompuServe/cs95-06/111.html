<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: June 18, 1995 11:06:07 PM</h3>
<pre>     Last I heard, I'd been scheduled for two big presenations,
&lt;at ComicCon&gt; that Saturday and Sunday.  There will be one separate 
presentation for Michael, possibly two, and a panel or two with 
both of us, plus a panel with me, Michael and Peter David.
