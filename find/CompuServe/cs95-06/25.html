<pre>     Not really.  Because even though we still haven't gotten final 
word yet, you can't wait until that comes to start writing scripts.  
You have to get some in the pipeline ahead of time, or you're screwed 
when it comes time to shoot.  We like to have 6 or so scripts on hand
the day we start rolling film.  So even though I haven't known what 
the final disposition is, I've had to keep writing, which is sometimes 
hard because you don't know what the deal is yet.  But at least I get 
to make my own hours a bit more.
