<pre>     Oops...I wuz wrong.

     On the off-chance that I might commit an error (I know, 
impossible, but there you are), I called around, and the Channel 
4 people are out here on business.  Some digging ended up getting 
the straight skinny on this: yes, there is going to be a break of
a few weeks because the Tour de France is going to be going on 
then, and anything else is going to get completely and totally 
lost and overwhelmed in the ratings.  So they're holding back for 
just a bit.
