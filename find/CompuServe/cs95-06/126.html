<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: June 23, 1995 9:41:15 PM</h3>
<pre>     Remember that the Io mission &lt;in GROPOS&gt; was just a cover, 
a red herring, for the actual mission.  So there really *was* no need.
  As for B5 background, there are some lurker's guides out there 
that have more info than anyone could ever want.
