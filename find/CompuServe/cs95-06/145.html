<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: June 28, 1995 11:54:31 PM</h3>
<pre>&lt;I was wondering if Dr. Franklin's tendency to misuse the "stims" 
when he gets swamped in med-lab indicates that they're addictive 
-- and is this possibly going to be a problem for him when he 
goofs due to diminished capacity under the influence, so to 
speak?&gt;
     
      We'll see....
