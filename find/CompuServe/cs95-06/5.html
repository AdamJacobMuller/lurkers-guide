<pre>     Don't lets be hasty here...they don't have the tapes yet 
because they haven't been sent yet, but should go out in a day 
or two.  There were some additional EFX needed for "Divided 
Loyalties," which we're finishing this week, and is the first 
of the last batch.  "Twilight" is done and "Confessions"&lt;&lt; I
think he meand "Comes The Inquisitor"&gt;&gt; will be done mid-next 
week, with the final EFX coming in on "Fall of Night" by the 
end or so of next week.

     So I wouldn't write it off just yet.
