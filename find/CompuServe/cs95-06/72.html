<pre>     "without the benefit of the depth of the established 
Star Trek universe it's not as good..."

     The Star Trek universe is the end result of 30 years 
of history.  Do you think it's fair to compare something 
that's got 30 years of history against a show that's got 
only two, and use age as the primary criterion of quality?  
If so, then NO show will ever be as good (by your lights), 
and never gives any other show the opportunity.  To use that 
same logic, then with only two seasons under its belt in 
the 1960s, ST could never be any good because at that time 
it didn't have the "depth" that it acquired (or, more 
correctly, was attached to it) over the following 28 years.

     I'd also point out that when Star Trek first hit the 
airwaves back then, many media SF fans and critics panned 
it as nothing more than a cheap attempt at grabbing some of 
Lost in Space's audience (the show was very successful at 
the time).  They said that LiS had depth, there was a family, 
they had strong relations, it was about hanging together...
whereas Star Trek, they said, was just a mindless shoot-em-up 
about salt monsters (they generally gave the show a cursory glance).  
Star Trek fans at the time felt this was *very* unfair, that 
their show was being dismissed by fans of another show without 
giving it a decent opportunity, and certainly they wouldn't 
do this to another show if the situation were reversed.

     But times change, I guess.  Or do they...?

     And speaking of "depth of the established Star Trek 
universe," some questions: who is currently the President 
of Starfleet?  What's happening back home right now?  
Have ethnic fashions survived the ages on Earth?  
How much do you *really* know about what's in the "established
 Star Trek universe" except what happens on the ship/station?
