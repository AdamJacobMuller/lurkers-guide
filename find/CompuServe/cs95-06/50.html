<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: June 10, 1995 7:14:02 PM</h3>
<pre>     We're *slowly* growing to include the mainstream audience.
Mainstream viewers go to ST first because, well, it's ST and a known
commodity.  They don't routinely check out other SF shows.  Slowly,
though, we're starting to draw in that audience.  I'm getting more
letters lately than ever before saying, "I've never watched much SF
before, but now I've started watching B5.'  That will likely
continue.

     The biggest obstacle in the beginning was the negative
reviews that came from reviewers who expected us to do ST,
and we didn't, and thus they perceived us as somehow doing ST
 "wrong."  So now it's all word of mouth.
