<pre>    RE: SF and ST and the like...actually, there is some 
differentiation there to be found.  From the reports, and 
demographics, and research that has passed over my desk 
(most of which I try to ignore), it seems as though there's 
a distinction: about 60% of avid ST viewers are also SF fans, 
however nominally, in that they watch other SF shows (mostly) 
or read SF novels/stories (fewer still).  About 40% or so 
don't read or watch other SF; they're *specifically* ST fans.

     Which is why one should always be careful making the 
automatic assumption that if one likes ST, then one is an SF 
fan, and thus should give B5 a chance.  There is not always a 
corrolation.
