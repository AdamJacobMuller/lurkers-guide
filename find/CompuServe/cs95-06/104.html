<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: June 18, 1995 12:22:31 AM</h3>
<pre> &lt;In the teaser for "The Coming Of Shadows", where G'Kar is 
trying to pursuade Sheridan not to allow the Centari Emperor on 
board B5, there is a display case behind Sheridan's 
desk. One of the items in the display case looks like a duck's 
head on a stand. What is it really?&gt;
     
I think it's a puzzle, but until I can check the tape, I can't be 
100% sure.
