<pre>     Actually (and this is far more information that anyone 
could conceivably want), since it's come up...yes, definitely 
more than a few books.  The total stands at 12 produced plays, 2 
published novels, 1 published anthology, a number of published 
short stories, a dozen or so produced radio dramas, something 
over 120 produced episodes of television (I'm afraid I've 
lost count, could be 130 or so by now), and over 500 published 
articles for places like THE LOS ANGELES TIMES, PENTHOUSE, VIDEO 
REVIEW, LOS ANGELES HERALD EXAMINER, WRITER'S DIGEST, TIME INC. 
and others.
