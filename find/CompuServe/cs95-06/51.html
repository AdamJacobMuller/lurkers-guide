<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: June 10, 1995 7:14:16 PM</h3>
<pre>     I've been to a total of two focus groups for B5.  I didn't
want to go. Didn't want there to BE a focus group.  I think
they're the tools of the devil.  They generally find these
people at the nearest shopping mall; they're people to whom
the $50 to come and do this is important; it's either this,
or sell blood, I sometimes think.

     We're talking here Focus Groups of the Living Dead.

     At one of these...the last I was invited to...one of
the guys on the other side of the two-way mirror said he didn't
like B5 because it wasn't the way science fiction was supposed
to be, it was lots of character stuff, and he didn't like that.
"So what would you consider good science fiction?" he was asked
by the facilitator.

     "Power Rangers," he said.

     I nearly went through the glass at him.
