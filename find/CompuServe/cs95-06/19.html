<pre>     It varies.  Internet alone takes up to 3 hours a day, because 
of the nature of my newsreader, and the sheer volume of messages to 
wade through (I think you get 200-400 per day just there alone).  
CIS is a little faster, thanks to a) Tapcis and b) a smaller volume 
of messages.  Ditto for GEnie. Basically, if you added it all up, 
it would come out to about 2-3 8 hour work days per week.

     I don't actually find the time, I *make* the time, usually 
trying to slog through it all between midnight and 4 a.m. on 
weekdays, afternoons on the weekends, and the like.

                                                                jms
