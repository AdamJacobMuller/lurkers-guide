<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: June 18, 1995 6:14:13 PM</h3>
<pre>     B5 need not bring in huge ratings for some at Paramount to 
view us as a threat; in point of fact they've treated us that way 
from day one.  The ratings overall and support for DS9 are very 
soft.  They can't afford to lose anyone.  But they're aware that
many DS9 fans have tuned out to begin watching B5 because, well, 
things *happen* in this show.
