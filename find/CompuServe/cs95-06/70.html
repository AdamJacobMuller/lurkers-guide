<h3>Section: Star Trek<br>Date: June 11, 1995 9:38:24 PM</h3>
<pre>     Nope.  Still wrong.  Lost in Space preceded Star Trek, 
and until it went campy, was exclusively SF (as much SF as 
ST was at times, which tended to vary wildly), with the 
same characters in the same setting every week.

     Just for purposes of historical accuracy.
