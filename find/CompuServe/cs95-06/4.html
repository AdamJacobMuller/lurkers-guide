<pre>     I thought the Splitting Image folks did a *very* good job; 
some of the makeups were a little "flat," in terms of the usual 
texturing we do to make it look like actual skin, but that's a 
very small quibble.  The makeups and costumes were extremely 
good, and I was quite impressed.  (Stupidly, I didn't recognize 
the last as Deathwalker initially, only because it's been so 
long, and it was entirely my fault.)
