<H2> B5's Military Metaphor		</H2>
<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: June 14, 1995 11:15:15 PM</h3>
<pre>     As I responded in private mail, I'm drawing upon a number
of military influences in the show; some from WW I, in the Great
War and how WW I sort of slid into WW II; some tactical and
strategic elements of WW II military; and some of the political
elements that went into the Vietnam and Korean conflicts.
Actual tactics and battles will vary; there's a major battle
setpiece in a later episode that uses more contemporary and
futuristic elements such as long-distance (thousands of
kilometers) tactics, interceptors and the like.

     Also as I noted in email...I just learned today from someone
high up in military PR in Washington that Babylon 5 is very popular
with many branches of the military.  They call it a "force multiplier"
(morale booster) for naval and air force and ground troops (apparently
the show gets shipped out to bases and to carrier/battleship groups).
It's also very popular with many folks in the Pentagon and the Secret
Service.  (In one case, the Secret Service apparently did an analysis
of one of our episodes as an exercise in character analysis of
military persons under high-stress situations.)  The Flying Tigers
have also been very supportive of the show, even allowing us to use
their symbol in the series.
