<pre>&lt;On a completely different topic, I understand you have carpal 
tunnel syndrome. What was the first thing you notice 
that you now know was a symtom? I have been getting shooting 
pains up the side of my arm on the side of my left 
little finger, I was wondering if this might be a warning sign.&gt;

     Sounds like it.
