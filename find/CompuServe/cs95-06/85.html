<H2> Why B5 on TV?			</H2>
<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: June 14, 1995 11:15:17 PM</h3>
<pre>     Any time I come up with a story, I try to look around
to determine where it would work best.  This one *felt*
like it belonged to TV.

     More than that, though...I went into this looking to
create a saga for TV.  It wasn't so much coming up with the
story, and realizing it was a TV saga, as it was, "Nobody's ever
done a multi-year science fiction saga for television.
As a thought-experiment, can I come up with something that
would work in this medium?"  This led me to the structure that
became Babylon 5.
