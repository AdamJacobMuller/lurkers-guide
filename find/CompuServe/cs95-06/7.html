<pre>     It's nothing to do with quality.  WB Network is a different 
division of WB, and it's extremely competitive with PTEN.  We're 
talking here massive, honking corporate politics.  They wouldn't 
do it.  Further, WBN has *fewer clearances* in terms of TV stations 
than PTEN, and we'd end up losing many folks who don't have WBN 
network stations in their areas.
