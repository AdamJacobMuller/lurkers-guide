<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: June 03, 1995 3:38:24 AM</h3>
<pre>     Assuming we're renewed (we hope to finally hear next week), 
there are plans afoot to unveil an official in-house fan club 
operation here at B5, which would handle some convention liaison 
stuff for other conventions, and would eventually lead to a proper 
B5 convention which we would put together using the very same 
folks who make the show.  Since there's the benefit of PR, we 
wouldn't so much be looking to make a profit as just breaking 
even and, most important, having a good time...so the sense of 
it would be closer to a fan-run convention in tone.

     But be assured, that's at *least* a year down the road.  
Maybe more.
