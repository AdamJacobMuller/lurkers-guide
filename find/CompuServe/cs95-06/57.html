<pre>     "Bill Clinton's involvement in the Whitewater scandal."

     Except, frankly, I've now been waiting THREE YEARS to get one,
just ONE definitive statement of what the scandal IS.  And what,
if anything, they did.  Nobody seems able to find anything, yet
they keep dredging this term up over and over and over.  Watergate was
exposed in gory detail within one year of Woodward and Bernstein
really digging in.  I've finally had to conclude it's just smoke.
