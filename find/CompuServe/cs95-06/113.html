<pre>&lt;While you're passing out tidbits of info on Delenn, can you 
tell us how the obvious romantic relationship she has with 
Sheridan is going to be handled?&gt; 

     How will it be handled?  With discretion and dignity and 
grace of course.  Problem is, this isn't the sort of thing that 
collapses easily into a few-line message.  It'll have to come out 
organically, during the show.
