<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: June 18, 1995 6:29:22 PM</h3>
<pre>     Bear in mind that that "top ten" includes mainly game shows, 
talk shows and the like; only two of them, DS9 and Baywatch, are 
dramatic series.  In ratings you generally isolate the dramatic 
series from the rest, and in that ranking we range between the #4 
and #6 dramatic series in syndication.

     The main problem is lack of public awareness.  Most people 
don't know we exist.  Those who hear the name assume we're a Trek 
show.  Roughly 55% of those who hear about the show and sample it 
once, stay with it thereafter. The usual figure is closer to 30%.  
It's just a matter of getting that word out.  Mostly it's word of 
mouth.  At some point, we'll hit critical mass in the ratings; I 
just don't know when that'll happen.
