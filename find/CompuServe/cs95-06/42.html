<pre>     Yeah, "attempted boom" in the sense that studios try to
figure out what audiences want, and drag out focus groups,
and research, and plug in the "formula" (put in a kid for
the young crowd, maybe a pet as well, make it "campy"
since the networks can't take SF seriously, put in a
young hunk and a babe).  Never works.
