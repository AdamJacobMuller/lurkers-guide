<pre>     The bug is just a touch of the flu that seems to be
making the rounds.

     As for making a media "dynasty"...don't want to.  Assuming
the B5 story runs its full five years, and assuming we don't do
the possible follow-up story, my plan is to retire from TV
and return to writing novels and plays.

                                                                jms
