<pre>     Then again, you've got Thomas Jefferson who said, "Given
the choice between a government and no free press, and a free
press without a government, I would choose the latter."

     The job of the reporter is to get out the facts that an
informed electorate (emphasis on the word informed) needs in
order to determine who to vote for, what bills to support, what
changes to implement.  This is often inconvenient for politicians,
who'd much prefer that they did what they did in the shadows.
Consequently, they paint this picture of the media as a ravening
beast, the "liberal press," when in fact virtuallly every major
newspaper, TV station and radio station in the country is owned
by Big Business, which is invariably conservative in nature.

     Politicians and those citizens who fall for the okeydoke
speak of the "media bias," but the media is made up of may disparate
people, from different backgrounds, political beliefs, income levels
and educational backgrounds as, well, the country itself.  There's no
such thing as a collective "media bias," there are no secret cell
meetings where the new agenda is established every year.  It doesn't
exist except in the minds of politicians who wish to create this
image in order to discredit the messenger when the news is
inconvenient for them.

     And the reality is that the American press today is *tame*
considering what it has been like in the past.  There was
absolutely NO pretense about journalism, newspapers wore their
allegiances like banners.  Editorials and cartoons were vicious
beyond description.

     Without reporters, there would be only one source of information:
the government story.  Period.  Where I come from, that's not only
unAmerican, it's downright Soviet.  They may be unpleasant at times,
they may be rude, they may sometimes fall into the unfortunate
realm of the cult of personality, but the system is self-correcting;
such individuals fall from grace pretty fast in journalistic circles...
they may even be impertinent. But the simple truth is, sometimes the
only way to get pertinent information is to ask impertinent questions.

                                                               jms
