<H2> B5 vs. ST			</H2>
<h3>Section: Star Trek<br>Date: June 10, 1995 2:53:13 AM</h3>
<pre>     Yes, it is difficult selling anything new to television.
But you do not usually hear, "We've got one hospital show on the
air now, that means you can't sell any others because the market's
full."  Yet that has been the case with ST for years.

     What will cause *more* SF shows to come is, well, more SF
shows that succeed.  Up until now, ST has been viewed (using the
industry term) as a "non-repeating phenomenon."  And if you step
back and look at it from a network POV, they're quite correct.
Very, VERY few science fiction series have ever made it past the
second or third year.  But you can point to many mainstream shows
that have gone five, eight, twelve, even fifteen years (in the
case of such an abombination as "Hee, Haw").  "Murder, She Wrote,"
which I was a part of for two years, has been on the air...what?
Eleven years? Twelve?  Not one SF show has ever done that.

     As soon as you have more than one SF show that lasts more
than, say, three or four years, then you might see more.  We are
one of the very, VERY few to make it to its third season.  And,
consequently, some network and studio types are thinking maybe it can
be done, maybe you CAN have more than one around at the same
time.  But they're still edgy, and they still use the line that there's
only room for ST all too often.

     I'm not making this up, Don.  Even once we got the series pickup,
we were told by a WB exec, "I'm not holding out any hope for
this.  It has never been shown that there's any market for SF other
than Star Trek." (That person has subsequently come around.)

     And as an SF fan myself...the more good SF on television,
the more I like it.  The Morgan/Wong pair from X-Files are doing their
new Space series, and I wish it all the best.  The more the merrier;
competition helps the field.  I just wish the folks at Paramount
understood that, and took a healthy competition as something good,
not something to be attacked or destroyed in order to preserve a
franchise.
