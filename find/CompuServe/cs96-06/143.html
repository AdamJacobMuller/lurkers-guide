      No, of course there's free will.  But if I pull a trigger, and
the bullet flies out hitting someone in the head, what happens between
the moment of the trigger, and the impact, has nothing to do with free
will.  Sheridan made the choice -- free will -- to do what was done in
WWE.  There were two probable results, depending on whether he did or
didn't do as asked.  Once he did that, the two probabilities folded
into one actuality (a la Shroedinger's Cat).

      Which doesn't mean to say he won't *try* to change things....

                                                                  jms
