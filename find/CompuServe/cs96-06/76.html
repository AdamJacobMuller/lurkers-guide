      I liked "Unforgiven" quite a bit, but it isn't a film that I
could watch endlessly, or often.  The others are films that catch me up
and take me someplace I enjoy returning to, and if I'm channel surfing
and happen to land on one of them, I generally tend to stay.

                                                                  jms
