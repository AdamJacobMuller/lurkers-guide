      Thanks.  Also, our hard ratings shot up almost a full half a
point this quarter over our last batch of new episodes, from a 3.0, our
usual, to a 3.4, at a time when most syndicated shows were in a
downturn, including DS9, which went down over a full point during the
same period.  Warners is most pleased.

                                                                  jms
