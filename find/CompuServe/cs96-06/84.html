<pre> Vivien Loveday &lt;100705.2440@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Would they have contracted Drafa?

      There would've been a very few on deep space patrols, or on
isolated worlds that would've survived, yes, as was indicated in the
narration at the close of the episode, but you're talking about very,
very small numbers.  The race is still effectively dead.

                                                                  jms
