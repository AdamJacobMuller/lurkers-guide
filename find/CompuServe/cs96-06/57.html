<pre> John L. Creigh &lt;75270.423@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is is okay/legal to use the PTEN copyrighted gifs on a website?

      It's been general policy for WB to look the other way on that as
long as proper copyright notices are appended.

                                                                  jms
