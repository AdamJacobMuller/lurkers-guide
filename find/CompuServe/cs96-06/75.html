<pre> Doug Quinn &lt;76330.350@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; 1) On the destruction of B5 -- can I assume that the vision of B5
&gt; being blown to bits in in SIGNS &amp; PORTENTS is the same possible
&gt; future we saw in BABYLON SQUARED and in WAR WITHOUT END? Or was
&gt; the vision from SIGNS &amp; PORTENTS fortelling a different future
&gt; that's still out there? 2) Since Jeff Sinclair was Roman Catholic,
&gt; and since Jeff Sinclair became Valen, and since Valen became the
&gt; spiritual and political leader of the Minbari, does this mean
&gt; that the Minbari are Roman Catholic?

      Yes, the vision of B5 blowing was the same as the one from
Signs.

                                                                  jms
