<pre> Bruno Melancon &lt;102647.3222@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; BTW, did you start writing any fourth season episodes?

      Yup, I'm writing the first episode now, "The Hour of the Wolf,"
and we should have 6 in hand by the start of filming.

                                                                  jms
