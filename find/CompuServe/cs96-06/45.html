<pre> Vlobb &lt;101523.507@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Just how negative are those feelings?

      I didn't read the thread, but yes, Carl's right when he says
that we have to be careful to avoid storylines and the like.  Don't
worry, apology accepted; forgiven, forgotten, gone.  We learn by doing.

                                                                  jms
