<pre> Brian A. Thomas &lt;75231.1122@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Meanwhile is that book coming from Boxtree called "Making of
&gt; Babylon 5" or "Creating Babylon 5"?

      I think it's Creating B5...but I haven't gotten my copy yet, and
that's from memory.

                                                                  jms
