<H2>B5 at an end in NY?</H2>
<h3>Date: 16-Jun-96 16:29:34</h3>
<pre> Tim Kelly &lt;76735.3255@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; is picking up the show for a fourth season, WOR may be nixing the
&gt; show from their fall schedule? Now, I don't want to start a rumor,
&gt; but is there any truth to this???

      No, NY will continue to air the show next fall.  There's always
somebody saying they've got a "source" at WB saying one apocalyptic
thing or another...and they're always full of it.

                                                                  jms
