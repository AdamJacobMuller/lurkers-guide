<H2>B5 Renewal!!?</H2>
<h3>Date: 31-May-96 16:10:41</h3>
<pre> Vlobb &lt;101523.507@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Do you know yet if B5 is going to be renewed for another 1 or 2
&gt; seasons? If not, how are you going to decide what to do about
&gt; wrapping it up? I know that it's been said that you yourself
&gt; stated that you could finish it in one more season, but how are
&gt; you going to make that decision if you don't know how long you've
&gt; got?

       We'll know soon.  We're cautiously optimistic.

                                                                  jms
