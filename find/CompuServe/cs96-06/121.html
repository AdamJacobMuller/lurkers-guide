<H2>Another Death?</H2>
<h3>Date: 25 Jun 1996 12:56:50 -0700</h3>
<pre> Vlobb &lt;101523.507@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Do the future events depeticted in War Without End have to come
&gt; to pass, or has the future now been changed by the very fact that
&gt; Sheridan knows something of it? If so, do all the characters that
&gt; were alive in the future scenes in War Without End necesserally
&gt; have to be alive in that future now?

       Sheridan, by taking the actions he took to keep history on
track, has now pretty much assured that the events we see *will*
happen.

                                                                  jms
