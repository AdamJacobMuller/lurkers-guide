<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Just how much does WB "own"?
&gt; I notice everything is copyrighted by WB, so you don't own any of
&gt; it? If you want to write a novel or make another show based on the
&gt; B5 universe do you now have to get WB permission? Is this typical?

      Yes, on all TV series, the studio owns the copyright and all
that entails.  That's why ST in all its forms is (c) Paramount, not
Roddenberry.

                                                                  jms
