      Thanks.  Yes, the numbers and support led right to renewal.  I
should mention that the domestic ratings have grown enough that one of
the major station groups has committed its stations to return
double-runs of episodes for the coming year, so Los Angeles and a
number of other markets will be getting two showings per week again.

                                                                  jms
