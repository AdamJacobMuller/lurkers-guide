<pre> John M. Kahane &lt;102664.773@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; What kind of feeling and what kind of reaction do you have about
&gt; this side of the B5 success story?

      Actually, I've no idea...I don't socialize at all -- except for
B5 related gatherings, I haven't been to a party in...oh, about 2
years, maybe a bit more.  So I don't tend to hear from anyone *not*
really involved with the show in terms of other TV writers or
writer/producers.  I imagine I'll hear more when I get done with it.

                                                                  jms
