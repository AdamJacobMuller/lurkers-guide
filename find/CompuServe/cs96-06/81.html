<pre> Mark Sloan &lt;100407.3462@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; A question about "I&amp;E" (Second favourite episode of season 3 so
&gt; far, after Severed Dreams): Did Adira's killer suffer the same
&gt; fate as the guard who appeared in the episode's teaser? Now season
&gt; 4 has been confirmed, are you going to make him put all the
&gt; weight back on?
&gt; ?

      No, Adira's killer is still alive...can be useful, those folks.

                                                                  jms
