<pre> Mary Taylor &lt;75530.2650@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Does by any chance the major station group that has committed to
&gt; a return of double runs of the show include WPWR in Chicago?

      I'm reasonably sure that WPWR Chicago is one of those that have
committed to the new slate of double runs, but I'm not 100% sure; will
get a list as soon as available.

                                                                  jms
