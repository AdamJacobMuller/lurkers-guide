<H2>What of Earth?</H2>
<h3>Date: 23 Jun 1996 22:14:04 -0700</h3>
<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Second, has there been much shown in the economics of the
&gt; universe you've created? I've seen postings concerning the
&gt; relative military and technological strength of the major races
&gt; -- has there been any similar comparisons of economic influence? 
&gt; Is it something you consider part of the backstory when writing
&gt; episodes or is the amazingly complex factors you already juggle
&gt; quite enough?

      There's been some on economics, not nearly enough, though.

                                                                  jms
