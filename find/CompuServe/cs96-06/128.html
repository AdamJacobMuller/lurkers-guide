      Thanks.  It's primarily an effort to integrate the real world
into the series.  So much of SF on television tends to take place in a
vacuum.  The leader of the Federation is always the leader of the
Federation, we rarely hear about squabbling, elections, economic
problems, dissident groups breaking away...and when we do it's usually
a misunderstanding or basically good people with a different agenda
that can be quickly resolved.

      I think that integrating all of those elements lends an
atmosphere of verisimilitude to the story, making it all the more
*real*.

                                                                  jms
