<pre> TIMOTHY R. GREEN &lt;73023.143@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Do you think we have a purpose in the universe, or a purpose to
&gt; make the best of our lives as we find them?

      The purpose we have is the purpose we find, and that we *choose*
to find.  Acting on that purpose is another topic altogether....

                                                                  jms
