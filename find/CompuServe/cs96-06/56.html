<pre> Roseann M. Caputo &lt;103510.1542@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Was it updated as well?
&gt; Oh, will Peter David be writing any other episodes?
&gt; ?

      Thanks.  It's a great show, and fun to work on.

      To the question of the writing book...the version being
published this October is *completely* rewritten, stem to stern, with
new chapters and other goodies.

                                                                  jms
