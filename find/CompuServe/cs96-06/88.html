      Thanks.  The Television Thing to do would've been to have that
moment of victory, Sheridan saying the crisis is over, then fade to
black...but it was absolutely *vital* to go to the lower sections and
see the human cost of that victory.  War is never a bloodless game.

                                                                  jms
