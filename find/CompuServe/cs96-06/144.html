<pre>{original post had no questions}

      Okay, the error here was mine.  I was having dinner with a
friend a few weeks ago, and catching up on stuff (this friend also
works in the TV biz) and names were flying around...he mentioned that
Michael Piller was no longer involved in ST, and Tracy's name came
up...and this is entirely my own fault, I got the two juxtaposed in my
head.  So I misspoke myself.

                                                                  jms
