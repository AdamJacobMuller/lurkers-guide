<pre> Brian A. Thomas &lt;75231.1122@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Are they refuring to the next regular card set like the one we
&gt; saw before or is it a trading card game (none of the other stuff
&gt; listed on the page is anything but trading card game)? While we
&gt; are talking about Babylon 5 games, what is the current word on
&gt; the Babylon 5 RPG? Who is making it?
&gt; Any other stuff coming out for our computers soon?

      Fleer's coming out with a brand new card set, but not a card
game set.

      The RPG will be out from Chameleon later this year.

                                                                  jms
