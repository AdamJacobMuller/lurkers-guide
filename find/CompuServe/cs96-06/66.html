<pre> S J NICHOLSON &lt;76574.1663@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Do you (or anyone out there) know what your schedule would be
&gt; this weekend? Is it going to be Friday, Saturday and Sunday?

       I believe my main panels are in the afternoons on Saturday and
Sunday.

                                                                  jms
