      It was supposed to have been arranged by some of the folks at
Comic Con in Chicago.  When I got there, I asked if this had been taken
care of (they said they knew the right people, and I'd reimburse for
the cost involved). They said it was all going to go off as planned. 
If it didn't...then I'm hugely annoyed.

                                                                  jms
