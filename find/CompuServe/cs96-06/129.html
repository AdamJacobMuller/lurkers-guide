      "Neverwhere" will probably show up either on PBS or Bravo, since
it comes off the BBC.

      I've seen the "Dark Skies" pilot...it's kind of a hodge podge of
stuff. Parts are very effective, some aspects stretch credulity...but a
pilot can be a poor indicator of the series, so I'll definitely give it
a shot when the regular show begins.

                                                                  jms
