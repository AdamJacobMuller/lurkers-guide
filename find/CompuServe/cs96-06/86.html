<H2>&lt;More of Zathras?&gt;</H2>
<h3>Date: 16-Jun-96 11:08:28</h3>
<pre> Bernard F. Dowdy, J &lt;76550.347@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Will we see Zathras again in a future episode or was his trip
&gt; 1000 years into the past his exit from the series?

      I'd love to see Zathras again somehow....

                                                                  jms
