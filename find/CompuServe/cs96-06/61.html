<pre> Brian A. Thomas &lt;75231.1122@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Since I believe you said you were not going to pull another
&gt; season 3 and write all the scripts yourself, who can we expect to
&gt; see pen some eps this upcoming season? Niel Gaiman or Halan
&gt; Ellison? Also, who do we need to be writing to, outside of our
&gt; local stations, to insure that WB gives a speedy greenlight to
&gt; season 5 ASAP...after all, what is one last season to a big
&gt; studio like them?

      Nothing much to be done now for year 5, that will depend as does
every season on the ratings for the year preceding.

                                                                  jms
