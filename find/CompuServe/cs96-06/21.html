<pre> Rebecca Eschliman &lt;76072.2345@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Are there any more novels contracted after #6 (love the
&gt; Delenn/tea ceremony bit in #6)?

      They're waiting until we get formally renewed to contract for
more novels.  That should be soon.

                                                                  jms
