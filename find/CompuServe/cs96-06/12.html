<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;70530.2521@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; When Delenn has her time-flash, does she just see what happens in
&gt; the future, or is she actually there, like John's trip?

      No, she more just saw it as a passive recipient, whereas he was
actively There.

                                                                  jms
