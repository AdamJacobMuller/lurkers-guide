<pre> Tom O'Hay &lt;71264.106@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Years ago, after reading a story, I asked the children "How would
&gt; you like to go there?" Do you remember S Spielberg's "Amazing
&gt; Stories"?

      Thank you, I appreciate that.  That's really all I've ever
wanted, to tell a good story.

                                                                  jms
