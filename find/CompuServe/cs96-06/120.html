<pre> Vlobb &lt;101523.507@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Defining 10 as 'kills because (s)he enjoys doing it, and revels
&gt; in the deaths/pain of others' and 1 as 'kills because it is
&gt; necessery to do so for survival/etc', where would the Shadows
&gt; rate? How was the Chicago Comicon, BTW?

       On the 1-10 scale you suggest, and using those specific
criteria to make a decision, I'd rate the shadows right around E or F.

                                                                  jms
