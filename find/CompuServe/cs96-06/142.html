      No, what I said was that *time* works about the same way in
hyperspace, not distance, nor that there was necessarily a proportional
1-1 corrolation between realspace and hyperspace.  There's still some
distance involved in hyperspace, yes, though again there isn't always a
1-1 corrolation.  It takes 3 days to get to Earth.  It takes 4 days to
get to Centauri Prime, even though CP is almost twice the distance from
B5.  It's *extremely* confusing to navigate hyperspace, which is why
you need the beacons and transfer points, or it's extremely easy to get
permanently lost.

                                                                  jms
