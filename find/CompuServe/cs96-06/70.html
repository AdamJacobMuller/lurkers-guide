<pre> John M. Kahane &lt;102664.773@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; That places "Messages From Earth" about a week after
&gt; "Exogenesis," right? You start to see the dilemma?
&gt; Which means that "Severed Dreams" takes place about the 12th of
&gt; April? How's that so far?
&gt; But what does this do with the dates for "Sic Transit Vir" and
&gt; "Ceremonies of Light and Dark"? So any chance of you helping out
&gt; with the dates for all this, and a clearing up of some of the
&gt; timeline here for me?

      The only thing I can clear up is that Sic Transit was *not*
filmed prior to Ceremonies, the filming order was Severed, Ceremonies,
Avalon and Vir. Other than that, you're on your own.

                                                                  jms
