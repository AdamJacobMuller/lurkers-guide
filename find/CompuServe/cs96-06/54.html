<pre> Rebecca Eschliman &lt;76072.2345@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; In your "Hours of the Wolf," (with the uncertainties you must
&gt; deal with as a creator/executive producer of a syndicated show
&gt; you must have a continuing series of "Hours of the Wolf), do you
&gt; ever get story ideas about the B5 characters that occur well
&gt; outside of the the megastory you've committed yourself to tell? 
&gt; Would it be helpful or detrimental to start agitating at either
&gt; the local or WB-macro level for a guarantee (or as close as is
&gt; possible in the fluid dynamics of syndicated series) of a season
&gt; 5? Since you've indicated the possibility that you might be
&gt; required to compress seasons 4 and 5, is there any value to all
&gt; of the dedicated viewers stating up front that a compressed
&gt; season is not an acceptable option?

      Thanks.  Yes, I sometimes do get notions for stories with our
characters outside the B5 arc.  Earlier stuff, later stuff...you just
sorta file it away. I'll probably never get to telling any of it, but
it helps add truth to the writing because I know what they're doing
elsewhere and elsewhen.  Those tales will probably never be told.

                                                                  jms
