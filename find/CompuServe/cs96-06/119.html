      Since you mention the UK ratings, the newest volume of the B5
videotape, #11, just came out in the UK...and it's #1 on the charts,
topping the X-Files you cite.

      As for the other UK ratings you mention, Channel 4 is always
generally rated lower than BBC1 and BBC2; within the course of what C4
airs, B5 does *extremely* well for them, and just recently came in at
#16 in their list of programming.

                                                                  jms
