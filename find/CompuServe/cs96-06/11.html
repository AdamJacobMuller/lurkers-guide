<pre> Michael R. Marks &lt;104504.455@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I wish to know if videos will ever be released and why does
&gt; Warner seem to treat the show with indifference?

      Thanks; and we hope to have the videos out eventually.

                                                                  jms
