<H2>Another Death?</H2>

<pre> Deonaha M. Conlin &lt;102531.2627@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; But will the events we saw unfold as we saw them, or will they be
&gt; changed? Or did Sheridan exist in two time continuums at the same
&gt; time? Would his very knowledge of the future shade events
&gt; somewhat?

      Events will unfold as we saw them.  Sheridan might try to use
his knowledge to change things...but who knows, that may just bring
them about.

                                                                  jms
