       Y'know, every time a character gets introduced on this show,
there's always somebody who yells about killing him off.  I've been
told by folks on the nets, variously, to kill Londo ("Who's the jerk in
the Bozo hair?  He's a joke, he's ruining the show, space him!"), Vir
("Flounder in space?  Give me a break, he's nothing, throw him out an
airlock!"), Lennier and others, including Sheridan ("He smiles too
much, what's the deal, Smilin' Jack," which was a setup for his fall). 
Many people screamed to kill Sinclair during the first season...and
then were the first ones wanting him back a year later.

       And in each case, they went on to become some of our most
popular characters.

       Patience is a virtue.  We get to know people over time.  See
their strengths and weaknesses over time.  There's a lot more to Marcus
than meets the eye...and many people *do* like Marcus' character quite
a lot.

       The sad thing to me is to see folks who, if they don't
instantly spark to someone, say "Kill him!!!"  Which seems to me rather
cruel and intolerant for just not sparking to someone.  I wonder if
they have friends, or if they meet someone and instantly don't take to
them, do they wait in an alley and blow their brains out...or give them
time to grow...or at least take a wait-and-see attitude.  I sometimes
wonder about a society that breeds the notion that if you don't like a
character, let's *kill* them. Not, "let's not feature him," not "write
him out," but KILL him.  There's something rather disturbing in that.

       But...if Marcus doesn't work for you, he doesn't work for you. 
He does work for others.  And he works for me.

       I think you're outnumbered.

                                                                  jms
