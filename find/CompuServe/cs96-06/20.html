      I don't think they quite knew *how* this show was to be sold to
the audience; the arc wasn't heavily played initially, no.  Later,
moreso.

      I hear all the time though from new viewers who just started
watching, and are right up to speed.

      Re: changing the episodic structure...no, can't really do that,
because you have to think in larger terms, both down the road and how
the show airs overseas, minus those breaks.

                                                                  jms
