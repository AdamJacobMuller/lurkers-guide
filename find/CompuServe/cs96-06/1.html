<H2>Spoiler Vorlon Question</H2>
<h3>Date: 31-May-96 16:10:35</h3>
<pre> Vlobb &lt;101523.507@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I do, however, have one question (also about the Vorlon), that
&gt; you might be able to answer : Will whatever Kosh was doing to
&gt; Lyta in Passing Through Gethsemane have anything to do with the
&gt; overall (arc) plot at some time in the series?

       Yes, primarily because what Kosh was doing with Lyta (that
sounds vaguely suggestive) wasn't a one-time event.  There was a
transference going on, and that aspect will be heard from again.

                                                                  jms
