<pre> Rebecca Eschliman &lt;76072.2345@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is whatever it is they tried to make her tell them something that
&gt; concerns B5 in 2260-2262?

      No, what they were after from Delenn was info relevant to that
time, some of it related to their son.

                                                                  jms
