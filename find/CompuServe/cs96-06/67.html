<pre> Mark Pruett &lt;74133.3406@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Seconds...Seconds....was that the truly dark film with Rock
&gt; Hudson? Or am I remembering wrong?
&gt; You included The Shootist but not Robin and Marian?

      Yes, that was the Rock Hudson film...and the letterbox Forbidden
Planet has been out for some time on disk.

                                                                  jms
