<pre> Steve Brightman &lt;73420.3057@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Excuse for asking but just how old is Delenn ?
&gt; So I guess she must be at least 900 years old ?

      No, Delenn never said she held Valen when he died, she said she
held Dukhat, the last of the Grey Council leaders, at his death.

                                                                  jms
