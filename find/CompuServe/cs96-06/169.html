<pre> Simon Grierson &lt;100407.2075@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Can I just make a little point of observation here?
&gt; Micheal Statzynski into the same "Great Minds of Science Fiction"
&gt; category that I think they deserve to be in?

      I can't think of any higher compliment than to be included in
the same sentence as the Star Wars trilogy.

                                                                  jms
