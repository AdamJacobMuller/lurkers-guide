<pre> Vivien Loveday &lt;100705.2440@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; what is it, and what happened to it?

      Clarke has inside info that ISN would be going public soon with
info on what was *really* going on on Mars, his planned attack on B5,
and other stuff he wanted quiet.

                                                                  jms
