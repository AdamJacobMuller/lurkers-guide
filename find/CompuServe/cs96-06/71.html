<H2>B5 Publicity??</H2>
<h3>Date: 14-Jun-96 21:34:14</h3>
<pre> Chad Underkoffler &lt;102512.1310@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; The UK was pleasant, I trust?
&gt; Who handles B5 publicity?
&gt; Is it WB or in-house Babylonian Productions?
&gt; Does that include talk show bookings, SNL guest hosting, and all
&gt; that jazz? but how do *you* feel personally as regards SNL's
&gt; tendency to parody the week's guest host's roles? I know you
&gt; dislike (or just don't want to see) fanfic B5 parodies, what
&gt; about parodies done by the Not Ready for Prime Time Players? have
&gt; you seen the RPG playtest rules and background? Is it true to your
&gt; vision?

      WB has generally handled B5's publicity, though we've lately
hired our own publicists to help gain additional exposure.

      Parodies don't bother me.

      Newsletters have begun going out; posters and fan club packets
have had to wait until we got everything worked out.  Remember, please,
everybody, that the FC is a new creation, was not a going concern;
those who got in at the very beginning will have a short wait that
those joining thereafter won't have.  As with everything else we do, we
try and do it *right*.  If that takes a bit longer, so be it.  (I sent
back the new poster design twice for small changes and improvements,
which alone put things back.)

                                                                  jms
