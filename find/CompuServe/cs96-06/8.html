      This is probably the most commonly asked question, and the
answer remains...I dunno.  Right now, the sheer task of getting this
show made now, for TV, is sufficiently daunting, that the idea of
telling it again in print is enough to make me tip over.  Also, this
show was *designed* for TV; if I'd wanted to write a nove, I'd've
written a novel.

      So for now, the answer remains "I dunno."

                                                                  jms
