<h3>Date: 03-Jun-96 00:57:32</h3>
<pre>      Can't recall if I mentioned this earlier, but...in addition to
being at the Wolf 359 convention in Blackpool this coming weekend, I'll
be doing an autograph session at Forbidden Planet Bookstore in London
this Thursday at 4 p.m. along with David Bassom, author of "Creating
Babylon 5" and "The A-Z of Babylon 5."

                                                                  jms
