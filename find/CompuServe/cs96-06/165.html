      I don't generally watch any of the ST shows.  I like X-Files
quite a bit, haven't seen virtually anything of Sliders...though I can
tell you now that the next big, nifty show to come along in the
fantasy/sf genre is going to be "Neverwhere" by Neil Gaiman.  I've seen
a couple of episodes of it, and it's neat.  Look for it later in the
year or spring.  (It's from the BBC.)

                                                                  jms
