<pre> Simon Grierson &lt;100407.2075@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; It seems clear that there is demand for B5 Merchandise of this
&gt; type - so can I ask (if I may be so bold) why there is no such
&gt; merchandise, other than the Micromachines and Stamp sets,
&gt; availalbe? Have you any information?
&gt; Oh - before I go, is there any information on B5 Club membership
&gt; in the UK?

      We're going after the pirates.  On the model front...basically,
all that has to happen is for a model company to come to us and make a
deal to produce the models.  (A decent sized company.)  So far, none of
them have, on the theory that only ST models sell from TV shows.  Maybe
if they heard from consumers interested in B5 models, they'd come to us
and make a deal.

                                                                  jms
