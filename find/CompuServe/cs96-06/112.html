<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Any ETA when the page will be on-line?

       As soon as WB stops dithering about and gives us authorization
to put it out there.  All licensed stuff has to go through their
auspices, and they're taking their time.  We're pressing them as much
as we can; we've had a beta site on line now since May.

                                                                  jms
