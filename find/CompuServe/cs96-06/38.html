<H2>Joining B-5 Fan Club?</H2>

<pre> Marte Brengle &lt;76703.4242@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Anyone actually got the fan club stuff yet?

      The first issue of the newsletter -- Universe Today -- should be
going out this week, if it hasn't already started going out.  There
were a few glitches in the cards from the printer that had to be
corrected, and I wanted to make some final changes to the poster, which
now looks better.  It's all in place now, however.

                                                                  jms
