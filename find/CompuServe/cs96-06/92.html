<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;70530.2521@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Was it?

      Certainly, one theme of the show is how we each deal with the
traumas that beset us, and the choices we make.  The difference is in
how we handle them.  In "Shadow" and "Interludes" both Londo and
Sheridan have to confront somewhat similar losses: the death of a loved
one.  But Sheridan, at the last, was willing to suck in the pain and do
what was right, however much it grieved him, and forego
revenge...Londo, on the other hand, has embraced revenge.

                                                                  jms
