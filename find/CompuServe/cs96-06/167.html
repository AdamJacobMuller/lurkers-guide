<pre> Michael N. Rubinste &lt;74012.147@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; If Londo believes that Adira was killed by Refa, and wants
&gt; revenge, then why doesn't he just have Refa killed, like he
&gt; threatened to do?

      Refa is a powerful guy now, with powerful allies; he needs
money, in large amounts, and more influence, so when and if Refa would
get it, there wouldn't be the kinds of repercussions that might
otherwise come, as with a mafia hit, for instance.

                                                                  jms
