<h3>Date: 27 Jun 1996 13:53:12 -0700</h3>
<pre> Richard Wakefield &lt;100534.504@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; How many Hyperspace hours away are the various races from Earth ?
&gt; do all ships travel the same speed in Hyperspace, or can some go
&gt; faster...meaning shorter travel times, etc ? And, finally :), we
&gt; know the tech order of the races, does this also equate to their
&gt; ships speeds ? Is this fast, or slow compared to EA ships ?

       Hyperspace isn't like warp speed, you don't generally run into
the same problems with time dilation.  It's largely the same in both
places.

                                                                  jms
