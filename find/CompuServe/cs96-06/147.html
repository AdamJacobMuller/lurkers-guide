<pre> Michael Studte &lt;100245.2335@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Now, when do we start the campaign to get the series renewed for
&gt; its fifth year? And is there any light on the horizon for a
&gt; laserdisk release of the series?

      Thanks.  There's nothing much happening currently on videos or
disks; in the fullness of time, I suppose....

                                                                  jms
