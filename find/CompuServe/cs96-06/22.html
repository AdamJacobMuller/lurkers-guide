      The character-oriented wav and avi files weren't done because
there are still pending matters to be worked out with the various
unions -- SAG, WGA and DGA -- about how those are to be used.  It's
still a new medium, and how you reuse footage shot contractually for
purpose A, turned to use B, and what residual structure you follow, is
still being worked out.

                                                                  jms
