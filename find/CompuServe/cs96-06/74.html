<pre> Anita Karve &lt;73653.3253@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Any chance of covering those areas in B5 movies after the 5th
&gt; season is over? If not commercial features, what about
&gt; made-for-television ones?

      We'll kinda have to see what happens when it comes round to make
that decision; right now just telling this one story now takes up 110%
of my time.

                                                                  jms
