<H2>Sidebars 2: Cabaret</H2>
<h3>Date: 12-Jun-96 13:41:53</h3>
<pre>      I wouldn't say Cabaret was my favorite movie of all time, but
it's certainly one of my tops, and that one scene, "Tomorrow Belongs to
Me" still scares the hell out of me.

      If I had to delineate my favorite films overall, they'd be
Seconds, They Might Be Giants, Forbidden Planet, The Stuntman, A
Christmas Story, The Empire Strikes Back, Cabaret, Failsafe, Seven Days
in May, Aliens, All That Jazz, The Day the Earth Stood Still, Glory,
The Haunting of Hill House, Road Warrior, Terminator 1 and 2, The
Natural, Network, Something Wicked This Way Comes, The Rocky Horror
Picture Show, Phantom of the Paradise, When Worlds Collide, The Seven
Faces of Dr. Lao, The Shootist, War of the Worlds, Stalag 17, and The 
Time Machine.

      Those are films I can watch again and again and never get bored
with them.  Lao is a particular favorite, it's just a beautiful film. 
I tend to love films that break your heart or make it soar, or both at
the same time, like Glory, or Giants.

                                                                  jms
