<pre> Art W. Sullivan &lt;104630.1315@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Did you start with the place B5 and write forward, letting the
&gt; story evolve, or backwards from a conclusion? Are you a character
&gt; or plot driven writer?

       I started with the place, but basically saw the story in one
full blown moment of clarity...dunno where that sort of thing comes
from.

                                                                  jms
