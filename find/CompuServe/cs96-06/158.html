<pre> Richard Wakefield &lt;100534.504@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Does this mean Ships travel at different speeds in Hyperspace ?
&gt; And maybe the Vorlons and Shadows are so advanced they can go
&gt; faster, hence the WStar + Battlecruisers ??

      Actually, the White Star doesn't go to Earth in "Severed," it
goes in "Messages from Earth," and it's stated in dialogue that it
takes 3 days in that episode as well.

                                                                  jms
