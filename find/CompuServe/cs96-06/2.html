<pre> Vlobb &lt;101523.507@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Just a thought, people are probbably going to hate me for asking
&gt; this, but where exactly does the storyline to War Without End
&gt; Begin?

       The storyline began millions of years ago.

       We're coming in in the middle of the story.

       But then, that can be said of all of us.

                                                                  jms
