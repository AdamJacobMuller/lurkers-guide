<pre> Chris Shepard &lt;102076.276@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; BTW, what made you get in touch with Ron Thorton?

      Thanks.  John, Doug and I had originally worked with Ron on
Captain Power, so that's where that connection comes from.

                                                                  jms
