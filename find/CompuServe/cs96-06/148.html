      Yeah, five seasons would be 110 episodes.

      Thanks re: the producer part.  This is probably the one area I
get asked about the least, and the hardest part of the job.  You have
to make sure each and every element intersects correctly with every
other element, and that takes some juggling.

                                                                  jms
