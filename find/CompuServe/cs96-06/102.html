      That's good to hear from the ABA booths.  Thanks.

      Re: the fan/pro relationship (which can be difficult at
times)...yes, I do tend to think that because many SF pros come from
the ranks of fans, it makes them more receptive to and sympathetic to
that side of things.  It makes me *very* annoyed to see people who've
stood in line for 1, 2 or 3 hours for an autograph being turned aside. 
If I have any control over this, I won't have it.  (The only time I
haven't been in control of this was at Wolf, where a number of folks
were turned aside, and that's something the organizers and I have to
discuss for next time.  I also found out, after the fact, that some 
folks were turned away from the Forbidden Planet signing because they
brought stuff instead of buying, and that was NEVER a condition that
I'd agreed to or even knew about, and I'm quite unhappy about that.)

      Generally speaking, I don't care how long I have to sit there
and sign, ain't *nobody* walking away empty handed if I can help it. 
Because I've been in that position myself.

                                                                  jms
