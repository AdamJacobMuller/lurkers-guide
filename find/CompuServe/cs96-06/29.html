<H2>New Upcomings or Reruns?</H2>
<h3>Date: 02-Jun-96 15:56:47</h3>
<pre> Jack P &lt;102474.2071@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Does the producers intend to show any new continuing episodes for
&gt; the summer or we'll all have to wait until the fall implying in
&gt; the meantime we'll just watch the past season reruns? Also I don't
&gt; know why in the world would the LA station airing the B5 show as
&gt; they always have, show the week's encore of other shows(less
&gt; desirable) and not B5 for those that couldn't be around the first
&gt; time?

      The produers of B5 -- viz, me -- have no control or influence
over the scheduling of episodes or reruns.  Just FYI.

                                                                  jms
