<pre> Shane S. Shellenbarger &lt;104305.3404@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Joe, Putting aside your total lack of time, are you interested in
&gt; directing?

      I go back and forth on this.  Basically, no, I'm not interested
in directing.  On the other hand, my gut (and my agent) tells me that I
should do it at least once, just so I understand the process (a good
idea), and to add that aspect to my resume.  I dunno...we'll see.

                                                                  jms
