<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: July 24, 1995 2:39:13 PM</h3>
<pre>&lt;I read on Usenet that you're introducing a new character 
named Marcus.  Can you tell us anything about him, the actor 
portraying him, etc?

I was also wondering if you could upload a new gif or two of 
the station.&gt;

      I think that uploading can be done.

      As for Marcus...he's a Ranger, who'll be seen a lot 
in the coming season.

                                                        jms
