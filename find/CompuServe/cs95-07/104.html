<H2> Season 3 Starts Shooting		</H2>
<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: July 31, 1995 11:40:14 PM</h3>
<pre>     We did indeed shoot our first day on year three today, and it went 
very well.  We wrapped about a half hour early, about seven-ish, the cast
is happy to be back, everyone's fallen right into step...it's a wonder 
to behold.

                                                                jms
