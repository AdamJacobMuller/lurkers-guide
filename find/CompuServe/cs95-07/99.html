<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: July 31, 1995 12:45:19 PM</h3>
<pre>     The only thing I'd suggest is adding either And the Sky Full of 
Stars and/or The Parliament of Dreams.

     Photos or other residue can always be sent along to us, at the 
address: 14431 Ventura Boulevard, Sherman Oaks, CA 91423.  Be sure to 
include C/O Babylon 5 in the address.

                                                                 jms
