<H2> B5 Convention			</H2>
<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: July 05, 1995 10:07:09 PM</h3>
<pre>     I can't technically endorse *anything* until there's a 
business plan and things get real.  Y'unnderstand, I get asked 
CONSTANTLY to endorse one convention or another in the 
nascent stages, "We haven't done this before, but if you'll 
endorse us, we know we can do it," and I'm the one who gets the 
rap if things don't work out.  So I really can't comment in 
any kind of official capacity until this would get real-er.
