<pre>     You can't move the NASA zero-g trainer; it's where it is, in 
Florida. We're in California.  Also, they don't really have a zero-g 
trainer in the sense you mean; they have a water-tank that simulates 
zero-g using carefully balanced counterweights and lifts.  Again, that 
won't transport to CA.  We can't use the Vomit Comet airplane in a series 
like this, which only lets you shoot for 30 seconds at a time, at hideous 
cost.

     We have, however, vastly improved the interior of the station, which 
you'll see in more detail than ever before in one of the final four 
episodes.  I think it's a *substantial* improvement.

                                                                jms
