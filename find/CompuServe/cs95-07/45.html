<pre>&lt;A question: I noticed for the first time while watching 'Hunter, Prey' 
tonight that the oxygen mask that Sheridan wore while visiting Kosh in his 
quarters is lit from the inside. I'm wondering, is it to better light the 
actor's facial expressions inside so the camera can get a 
better view or does it serve some other function? Maybe it prevents glare or 
unwanted reflections on the outside of the faceplate? Thanks.&gt;

     Er, it does both.  Yeah, that's it, that's my theory, and I'm 
sticking to it.

     Though mainly it does make the actor's face clearer.

                                                                    jms
