<pre>     Yeah, well, you only need to watch Dole hold a pencil to 
figure out why he came out for the disabilities act; if it's in 
his personal interest, then he's for it; if it serves the rest 
of the commonweal (except the big money boys, which thus also 
constitutes a personal interest), he's a'gin it.
