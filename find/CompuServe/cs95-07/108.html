<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: July 30, 1995 8:42:09 PM</h3>
<pre>     One thing you have to remember is that while Talia is in the opening 
credits, to Psi Corps she's just one more of many programmed individuals in
various places.  The character in "Spider" was a highly valued infiltration
unit, with very expensive "parts."  Of the two, Talia would've been far more
expendable.  And I don't recall that Control actually issued any death order;
it was the Psi Corps/B13 in any event.

                                                                 jms
