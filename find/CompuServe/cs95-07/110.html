<pre>&lt;I wonder if you would settle an argument that has been raging about 
the shooting at Lyta in Divided Loyalties.
Is the hand with the gun  Left or Right?&gt;

     I don't remember offhand; I'll have to check the tape.  (I have a 
vague memory that it was a right hand originally, flopped to shoot in the 
other direction.)
