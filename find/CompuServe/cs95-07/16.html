<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: July 06, 1995 9:24:25 PM</h3>
<pre>     There are some deliberate connotations to be derived from 
choosing Agamemnon, yes. Particularly as re: Cassandra, given 
that G'Kar is our nominal Cassandra figure in the 
story...someone gifted with the power of prophecy (though not 
literally in G'Kar's case) who was cursed in that no one would 
never believe her until it was too late.
