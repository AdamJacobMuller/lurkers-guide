<pre>     Re: things you don't expect to happen...that's kind of one 
aspect I was after here.  By way of comparison....

     There's one great thing about The Shining, despite some other 
flaws in the film: they set up Scatman Cruthers (sp?) as the one guy 
who understands what's going on...he gets the Shining, he's a potentially 
heroic character, and when all hell breaks loose, he's the one to 
get into the snow plow, cross terrible weather, we're all sure he's going 
to get there and fight the menace...he overcomes weather and nonsense 
to get there...he blows through the front door, ready for action....
and gets an axe in the middle of his chest and dies.

     I *loved* that, and always kinda wanted to something of that nature, 
where you set someone up to be that kind of character, the future, 
whatever, then you yank it back and let the audience say, Oh, hell, 
NOW what?
