<H2> B5 at Shore Leave		</H2>
<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: July 15, 1995 12:56:09 AM</h3>
<pre>&lt;Just wanted  to share with you and the rest of the online world 
the wonderful time we had at Shore Leave talking to  MOJO.   [...]

P.S.  Any signs of a B5 Convention, esp. on the east coast?&gt;

     That's good to hear.  Glad it went well.  The only other East Coast
 con I know of for a bit is Magnum Opus Con in Florida shortly.

                                                                   jms
