<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: July 30, 1995 9:00:08 PM</h3>
<pre>&lt;Joe:

I inadvertantly purchased an unlicensed bumpersticker from Starbase Columbus 
thru the mail.  The sticker says "Beyond the Final Frontier lies Babylon 5" 
with the B5 logo (trademark not acknowledged).  The sticker was produced by 
Pegasus Publishing and shows their copywrite.&lt;sic&gt;  It also has a lousy 
production quality -- that will teach me to order thru the mail.

Would you like this sticker and the address &amp; phone for Starbase Columbus?&gt;

     Yeah, I'd appreciate the info on that.  And if you've got one, all the 
better.

     Bad enough it's pirate, but to have crummy artwork...sheesh....
