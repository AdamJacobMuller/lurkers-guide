<H2> Big Bang Latest			</H2>
<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: July 18, 1995 1:47:29 AM</h3>
<pre>&lt;I have just returned from NASFiC in Atlanta, which I have to say, 
compared to what I heard there of Big Bang, it was the second worst Con 
this month...

	From an Exhibitor who attended BB; John Delancie was left at 
the airport for 3 hours!
	When he finally arrived at the Con, he was told that his 
presentation was cancelled because he was late. He stood up to them, 
reportedly, saying that the presentation would go on because it was 
thru their fault, not his, that he was late.
	When attempting to go on with the presentation, the BB people 
shut off his lights and microphone. DeLancie then told those who were 
interested could meet him outside and he would talk to them.
	The auditorium where the autograph line was had been 
sandblasted the day before. For four hours, while the Big Bang 
Security Geeks let their *friends* ahead of everyone else, the fans 
were breathing concrete dust!
	Everyone was told there would be a limit to 2 autographs - to 
which Mr. DeLancie responded by signing everything he could get his 
hands on! BRAVO!
	My source for this info (as he related to me) knew there was
problems when he got in the taxi and the driver never even heard of the 
place!
	Gee, we at NASFiC had it made in the shade compared to that!&gt;

     Yup...and that's just the beginning of the nightmare....
