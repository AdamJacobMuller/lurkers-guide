<pre>     Hmmm...if your info is correct (not saying it isn't, only 
that I haven't heard this new bit), the "new season" that begins 
for Voyager in August probably consists of the last 4 episodes 
they held back from their first season.  Assuming they play through, 
then the next month would have new season two episodes.  They 
only started filming their season recently, so they're really going 
to have to rush post-production to get material out there in time to 
meet airdates.

     Doesn't affect us at all (except perhaps the Mountain is hoping 
to get a leg up a bit), but I hope it doesn't cause compromises in 
quality to do it that fast.

     (The Mountain is LAspeak for Paramount; Warner Bros. is the 
Shield.)
