<pre>     Thanks.  He's a fascinating character to explore, and 
the most careful balancing act of the bunch; part of the 
character's appeal is that on a very fundamental level, 
you *like* him, and you don't want to see him on this 
terrible slide downward.  So every so often, you have 
to pull him back, go in a different direction, remind us of 
his basic humanity and potential for heroism.  He is, really, 
any of us caught in a web of events spinning more and more 
out of control every day.
