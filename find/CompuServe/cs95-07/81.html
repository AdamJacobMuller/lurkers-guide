<pre>     The differences between screenwriting and a novel...would take 
a book to communicate.  Suffice for now to say just that the strengths 
of a novel are all internal (internal monologue, POV, narrative 
descriptions), and the strength of a screenplay is all external 
(dialogue and visuals).

     Which is why the best novels often make the worst movies.
