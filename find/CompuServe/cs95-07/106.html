<pre>     I'd say the next 3 are equal or more on a wow scale, 
in some ways.

     One other thought on Talia...one of the motifes we've played 
with from the start was always showing Talia in mirrors...in Race, 
in Z'ha'dum and others...always showing the reflection, her opposite, 
just to set stuff up on an emotional/symbological level.

                                                               jms
