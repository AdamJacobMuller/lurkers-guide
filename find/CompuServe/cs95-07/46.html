<pre>&lt;Ever read this strange book by Julian Jaynes, "The Origin of 
Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind" ?

He posits that we, as humans, until recently, were raving 
schitzophrenics.  He claims that the Iliad and the people of 
it were unconscious, schitzo, and only recently the corpus 
callosum fully integrated to form a conscious mind.&gt;

     Yeah, I've read Jaynes' book, and was fascinated by it.  
But then I've always found the whole issue of the function of 
the corpus callosum to be of interest, particularly the 
split-brain experiments of the 1970s. Fascinating stuff.
