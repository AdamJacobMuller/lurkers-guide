<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: July 12, 1995 2:54:31 AM</h3>
<pre>     Larry's greatest skill is as a world-builder, and a 
script doctor in working with other writers.  The former 
comes from his background as a gamer, the latter from his 
years in TV.

     Problem with B5 is that this world is already built 
pretty completely, from one end to the other.  Also, the job 
of a story editor is mainly to sit and listen to pitches from 
outside writers, and to rewrite their scripts when they come 
in.  But in the case of B5, virtually all the scripts were 
based on presmises I'd assigned to writers; we took maybe two 
pitches in two years.  I wrote 12 scripts in year one, 15 in 
year two, and personally did just nearly all the rewrites on 
freelance scripts in year two.  Bottom line, there wasn't 
much for Larry to *do*, and there was a growing sense of 
frustration, in that he wasn't in a position to do what he's 
good at doing. So finally we parted ways.  Not much more to 
it than that.
