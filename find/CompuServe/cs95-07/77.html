<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: July 25, 1995 1:57:02 PM</h3>
<pre>     Warners is legitimately concerned about people offering to 
make mass numbers of copies of episodes and send them out to 
others, whether for profit or not.  Particularly when 
they haven't been seen in this country, such that it violates a 
lot of laws both domestic and international.  If someone is 
engaging in mass copying, be assured that Warners will have 
men with badges knocking on their doors in very short order.
