<pre>     Not to pick nits...X-FILES got nominated for Best Series, only 
the second time this has happened (I think the first was TNG, which 
I believe got a nomination in its final year).  So that's very 
encouraging.

     And we've gotten 3 nominations so far, and as for EFX, the 
ballots are still being counted in this and several other areas in 
which we think we have a good shot.

     Three nominations ain't bad...Kung Fu got zero, Baywatch zero, 
DS9 got only two, Pointman got zero, Hercules got zero....

                                                               jms
