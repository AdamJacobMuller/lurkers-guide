<H2> Big Bang Latest			</H2>
<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: July 19, 1995 12:39:29 AM</h3>
<pre>&lt;Joe - For your information, and the information of those in this 
Forum, a user came into both SFMEDIA and our companion Forum, SFLIT, 
advertising a "professionally edited" tape of highlights of the 
convention.

Due to the nature of the events of this convention -- something I 
consider to be fraud -- these messages have been pulled from public 
view and said person will NOT be allowed to advertise Big Bang 
materials on this Forum.

Just our small way of helping get rid of this kind of stuff in 
the future.&gt;

     Certainly inquiries should also be made as to whether or not 
the actors gave permission for their performances to be edited and 
sold in a profit- making capacity.  A copy of the contract should be 
provided if so, to help avoid any liability for CIS.

                                                                jms
