<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: July 17, 1995 1:00:22 AM</h3>
<pre>      There has always been a certain element of Jungian archetypes in the 
show, both in the shadows and elsewhere.  (Comes from having a degree in 
clinical psych, I suppose.)  There's a *lot* of thematic/symbolic stuff 
going on in the show, actually....

                                                                   jms
