<pre>     There is no pre-determined male/female ratio on the show; it's 
pretty much the luck of the draw or the script.  One thing that might 
help, though, is that we've changed casting directors.  We kinda kept 
nudging the one before for a greater diversity in guest roles (looking 
for different ethnic groups, looking for men and women equally in parts 
that can go either way), and our new one is definitely more inclined 
in that direction, so this will doubtless improve.
