<H2> B5 Emmy Nominations		</H2>
<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: July 20, 1995 3:45:18 PM</h3>
<pre>      As an aside...there are other areas in which we hope to receive 
recognition, among them directing, special effects, music and sound 
editing. Those ballots are still being counted, however, and won't be 
announced for another week or two.

     That aside, it's *very* hard to get actors recognized for their 
work in SF.  Ditto writing.  But we continue to improve.  The pilot B5 
movie got one nomination; the first season got two; the second season has 
gotten three so far, and possibly one or two more yet to come.

     If we keep going at this rate, it's going to be impossible for them 
to ignore us for long.  As is the case with X-Files.  They've begun 
receiving nominations in areas normally reserved for mainstream shows (and 
I'm absolutely thrilled spitless that they got the nom for Best Series; that's 
just terrific), so that bodes well for gradual change in the industry, and 
for B5 to start getting recognition in those same areas.
