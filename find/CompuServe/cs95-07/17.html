<H2> Emmy Nom. for B5?		</H2>

<pre>     I certainly hope so.  We've done all we can to help the 
process along. We've put many of our actors up for it via the 
application process, which is time-consuming and expensive, 
we made videocassettes up for academy members of two of our 
best episodes ("Coming --" and "Geometry of Shadows"), also 
very expensive...so we can only hope they get the 
recognition they deserve.

     I think we'll have a strong shot at some of the technical 
areas, like EFX, costuming, makeup, sound editing, music, that 
sort of thing, IF enough academy members actually *look* at the 
episodes, but the non-tech stuff, acting/writing/directing, are 
always long-shots in the SF genre, sadly.
