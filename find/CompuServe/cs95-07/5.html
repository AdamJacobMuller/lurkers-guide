<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: July 04, 1995 4:42:29 PM</h3>
<pre>     Have recently grown a beard.  The two most consistent 
comments I get:

     1) "Good heavens, it's so GREY!"

     2) "Oh, my (son/husband/brother) just grew a beard...
he's going through a mid-life crisis too."

     My kingdom for a nerf-bat.
