<pre>&lt;there's an odd gadget set on the bulkhead by sheridan's 
contact inH,P before she takes out the "whoop" anti-bug 
shield. it seems pointedat sheridan. later, when he gives her 
the data crystal, sheridan seemsto be holding it. neither 
mentions it, so i don't suppose you'd like to give
us a hint as to what it is......?&gt;

      It's a flashlight, and he's also holding one.  You caught 
a very small glitch.  Originally, he came out, flashed twice with 
his flashlight, giving the code; then she did the same, and 
THEN stepped out of the shadows, putting her flashlight down on 
the ledge beside her.  It took too long, though, interminably, 
so when we edited it, we cut out that sequence...and 
hoped nobody'd notice the flashlight sitting there.
