<pre>&lt;Thanks for creating B5.  We've had our first X Files 
convention in Sacto, how about B5 stopping by?&gt;

     Thanks.  We're definitely growing, it seems.  And the prospect of a true 
B5 convention is indeed a possibilitiy, though down the line a bit.

                                                               jms
