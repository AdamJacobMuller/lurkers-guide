&lt;After reading Issue #8, and looking back at previous eps, I think the 
encounter Talia had with Kosh and the ViCaR in season one make it appear 
more interesting.  (In "Deathwalker")&gt;

     You may very well see an echo of that scene, and learn why it was 
there in the first place, in that episode.

<pre>&lt;But don't the lights in the masks also make it hard for the people 
to see?&gt;

     Actually, our actors never seem to have a hard time getting 
around in them, so I'd guess no.
