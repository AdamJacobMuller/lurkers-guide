<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: July 23, 1995 5:53:23 PM</h3>
<pre>&lt;By the way, you have completely destroyed my calm, unruffled 
lifestyle.  After 23 years of happy TV-free existence, B5 caught 
us in less than 6 weeks after a loaner Tube landed in 
our living room.  This morning we wired up our new Surround sound 
system.  It's ALL YOUR FAULT.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  
(And an extra thanks to Mira Furlan.  Delenn is the one who hooked 
me!)&gt;

     I'm simply here to serve the commonweal.

     And the Dolby Surround Sound corporation.

     Thankyew.

                                                         jms
