<H2> Morden and his place		</H2>
<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: July 12, 1995 3:50:14 PM</h3>
<pre>&lt;In Signs and Portents (as I remember) Morden was confronted by 
Kosh in a corridor. Kosh said "They are not for you. Leave now."

We know Morden is never alone and that the Shadows with him 
engaged in combat with Kosh (they knocked out the lights and 
damaged his suit). What I want to know is who Kosh was talking 
to when he said what he did? Was it Morden or the Shadows with 
him?&gt;

     His comment would have been addressed to the shadows and 
their current emissary.
