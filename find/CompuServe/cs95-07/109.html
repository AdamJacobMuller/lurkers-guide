<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: July 31, 1995 11:29:29 PM</h3>
<pre>     The problem in trying to keep something mysterious and 
vague is thatsometimes you can outsmart yourself, and get 
confusing.  The *theory* isthat there was the Bureau as Control 
overall back on Earth; and a minor Control figure on B5.  And 
Controls are always referred to as "he"regardless of the facts 
to avoid giving any means of identification to anoutsider based 
on gender.

     So it would be

                            BUREAU CONTROL
            ----------------------|---------------------
            |                     |                    |
      Earthdome Control      B5 Control         Minipax Control


     (That's a breakdown using artificial and not necessarily
correctelements, just for illustration.)

     It is, however, a confusing bit of terminology, so it's been 
amended subsequently.
