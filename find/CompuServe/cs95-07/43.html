<H2> Big Bang Latest			</H2>
<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: July 16, 1995 5:18:08 PM</h3>
<pre>     Bad enough that Big Bang stiffed Michael O'Hare for the 
remaining $5,000 on his fee to attend the convention, bad 
enough the check to Mark Hammil to reimburse his travel 
expenses bounced, but I was just told today that the check for the 
remainder of his fee, $10,000, ALSO bounced.  There are vague 
mumblings about how they hope to replace the 
check in, oh, three months or so, but nobody's holding out any hopes.

     And, of course, there was the check to Walter Koenig that bounced 
and had to be replaced (fortunately this happened just *before* the 
convention, so he was able to make it clear he wouldn't attend if 
it wasn't replaced immediately), the many people who still haven't 
gotten refunds....

     There were a few people here offering apologia and explanations 
for the behavior of Big Bang/CMC earlier.  I note we haven't heard much 
from them here of late.

     This behavior is unconscionable and unforgiveable.

                                                                jms
