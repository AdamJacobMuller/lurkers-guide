<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: July 26, 1995 10:07:17 PM</h3>
<pre>&lt;Would a letter to WB about how not showing these episodes in the 
US, but allowing them to be shown in England, has spoiled the 
surprises you had planned for many of the biggest and most 
supportive (but weak willed and looking for a B5 fix) fans of the 
show do more harm than good?&gt;

     It wouldn't do a bit of good.
