<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: July 15, 1995 7:29:08 PM</h3>
<pre>     It'll be pretty much the same, minus the MSTB5 stuff, 
which was done by local fans.  I definitely encourage folks 
to be there for the 11am-1pm presentation I'm doing if you're 
*anywhere* in the San Diego area, because the presentation 
I'm giving won't be given again until after the new season 
begins in November.

     No confirmed cast members at this point, since they 
only gave us the one time slot, except Bill Mumy, who 
generally goes to SDCC every year, same as me.

                                                         jms
