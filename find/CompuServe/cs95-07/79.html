<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: July 25, 1995 1:57:06 PM</h3>
<pre>     Everyone always tells you it won't happen, you're wasting 
your time, it's pointless...because that's how they want to think, 
because someone achieving something makes someone who may not have 
done so feel self- conscoius, because they KNOW you and as it says 
in the New Testament "A prophet is without honor only in his own 
land and among his own people," and because overall the system is 
designed to keep you IN.  A writer by nature removes him- or herself 
from the system of 9-5 office type work.  Over time you make your 
own hours, your own schedule, you select who you work for... you're 
outside the normal space/time continuum, and between you and that 
goal is one hell of a lot of surface tension.

     Every writer has been told, at some point, "You'll never make 
it, why waste your time?"  Ninety percent of the time, they're right.  
Ten percent of the time they're not.  But you won't know which camp 
you fall in until you try.
