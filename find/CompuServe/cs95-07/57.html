<H2> Emmy Rip-Off			</H2>
<h3>Section: Babylon 5<br>Date: July 20, 1995 9:57:19 PM</h3>
<pre>     Actually, I only included Hercules because it's genre.

     In going over the list, you realize how kinda special this is; out 
of all the shows on television, network and syndicated, only 62 series, 
movies, comedies or specials were nominated; out of that, only ELEVEN are 
dramatic series.  And that eleven includes DS9, ST:V, X-Files and B5.  
So four out of those eleven dramatic series are genre series, about 
45%.  That ain't bad.

     And this time at bat, B5 got as many nominations as The John 
Larroquette Show, the Kennedy Center Honors, the Liz Taylor story, 
Murder She Wrote, Murphy Brown, the Simpsons and the Tonight Show.  And 
*more* nominations than Lois and Clark, Love &amp; War, Politically Incorrect 
and DS9, among others.

     So apart from the actors situation, I don't feel in the least 
slighted.

                                                                jms
