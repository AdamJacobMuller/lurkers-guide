<pre>     Re: advice on getting your foot in the door.

     Have a persistent foot.

     Write constantly.  For anyone and everyone.

     Patience, determination, direction and strength.

     And never follow somebody else's path; it doesn't work 
the same way twice for anyone...the path follows you and rolls 
up behind you as you walk, forcing the next person to find their 
own way.

                                                       jms
