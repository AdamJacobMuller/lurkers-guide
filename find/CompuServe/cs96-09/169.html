<H2>ZHD - Cut?</H2>
<h3>Date: 22 Sep 1996 13:45:32 -0700</h3>
<pre> Draco &lt;101603.2062@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Can anyone confirm if C4 have cut Z'Ha'Dum ??
&gt; Maybe we've missed something (I've still to watch the ep again),
&gt; but what went on after he shot at that Shadow?
&gt;  - did he kill it, did he shoot at Morden while he was there?
&gt; (I'm pretty sure I'd have done) And how did he get away?

      No, C4 didn't cut anything there.

                                                                  jms
