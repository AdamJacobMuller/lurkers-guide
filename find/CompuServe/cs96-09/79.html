<h3>Date: 11 Sep 1996 17:49:49 -0700</h3>
<pre> Tom General &lt;102233.2410@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Could you let us know when the major mailings are over, or when
&gt; to contact him? So, what do I do?
&gt; How long should I wait?
&gt; Come on, how much longer?

       I walked down the hall to Jim's office, and asked.  Your stuff
went out this morning, several hours ago.

                                                                  jms
