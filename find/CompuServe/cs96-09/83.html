"So, I suppose I meant "commemorate" in the way the post office does
 -- recognizing those who have died."

      Specific persons, no.  I don't do that.  Never have.  I think,
in the case of someone I know who's passed away, it would be rude.  I
don't think I could handle it.  Over the years I've lost way too many
friends, and some wounds never entirely heal.  Best to leave them
alone, and remember those friends as they were, not as they were bent
into fictionalizations.

                                                                  jms
