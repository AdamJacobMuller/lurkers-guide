      If they cut 7 seconds, it's likely the 7 seconds of the actual
stabbing itself, which is implicit in what happens afterward, so it
shouldn't have a major effect on being able to follow the story.  It's
a reasonable edit, and about what I'd expect given the general
attitudes on TV violence among the UK TV networks.

                                                                  jms
