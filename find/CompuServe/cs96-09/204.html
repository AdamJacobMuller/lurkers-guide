<pre> Michael Beemer &lt;71551.1670@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I *love* those little moments of synchronicity where I'm feeling
&gt; *exactly* the same thing as the characters - the three Shadow
&gt; vessels fade out ("bug out?" Now, a question - is the success of
&gt; this operation what caused the Shadows to put Anna into play? Did
&gt; this prove that Sheridan had to be dealt with *now*?

       It's certainly gotten their attention...but it's the events in
"Shadow Dancing" that tipped them into moving directly.

                                                                  jms
