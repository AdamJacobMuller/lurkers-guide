<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Do you think it would be bad etiquete to ask Bruce if he could
&gt; pass them along?

      Yeah, they're great; a UK company is doing a B5 calendar for
1997, which should be out shortly.

      Generally one does not give cast member A a parcel for cast
member B; mainly because it's never just one person who wants to do
this, and you can end up with 15-50 items to bring back with you.

                                                                  jms
