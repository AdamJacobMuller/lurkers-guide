<H2>B5 FAN CLUB INFO!</H2>
<h3>Date: 11 Sep 1996 11:51:18 -0700</h3>
<pre> Tom General &lt;102233.2410@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Can you come up with a way of getting to him in person?
&gt; Are the major mailings over now?
&gt; What about the rest of us?

       No, the major mailings aren't over, they're still going out.
Everyone who signed on will get/is getting their stuff.  He's had a lot
of email to contend with, but I do know that a lot of folks are a)
getting their stuff, and b) getting email replies.  He's getting to it.

                                                                  jms
