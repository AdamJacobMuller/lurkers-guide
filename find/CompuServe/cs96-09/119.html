      Thanks.  With "Shadow" my hope is really to erase most (though
obviously not all) suspicions or predictions on how the last one will
go.  If we already had our big EFX battle, it won't be that...Anna's
here, so it can't be that...it can't ever be a return to tabula rasa,
an empty slate, but by doing what's normally done in the season closer
one episode prior to that, it may help ease the way for a different
tonality to come in.

      And thanks again...you definitely won't be disappointed.

                                                                  jms
