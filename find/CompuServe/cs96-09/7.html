<pre> Spencer Collyer [UK] &lt;100137.230@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Does Neroon's revelation at the end of this episode mean that the
&gt; Warrior caste will now be more willing to fight alongside the
&gt; Religious caste, or is the blood between them a sign that they
&gt; are now irrevocably split?

      I think he's closer to an understanding, but we'll see if the
others all feel the same way.

                                                                  jms
