<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Why do the Vorlon ships come out of the jumpgates backwards?
&gt; Less painful?
&gt; Is this "Piece" the vorlons are looking for, his living spirit?
&gt; In all that confusion I cant remember if Garibaldi fired six
&gt; shots or only five?

      Vorlon ships come out backwards when possible to help
decelerate.

      Pat has interesting eyes...they're slightly larger than is the
norm, and they take some getting used to.  Those eyes are one of the
things that beckoned to me to cast her...they're the eyes of a
telepath, who sees more than should be seen.  They're terrific eyes.

                                                                  jms
