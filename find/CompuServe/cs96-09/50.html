       Except, of course, that going on at length about the death of
Refa would require revealing what he was doing there...and I doubt very
much that the Royal Court would like even the suspicion that one of its
own was making deals with the Narns to become public knowledge...so
it's extremely unlikely that there would be any retribution.  This is
one the Centauri would prefer to sweep under the rug, I think.

                                                                  jms
