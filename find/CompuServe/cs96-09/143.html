<H2>Z and the Q</H2>
<h3>Date: 18 Sep 1996 16:09:25 -0700</h3>
<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;75063.3305@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Question: Does the "explanation" in "Z'Ha'Dum" explain it all, or
&gt; will there still be unanswered questions about the Shadows and
&gt; Vorlons into next year?

       Well, it sorta answers all the questions...it's hard to explain
until you've seen the episode and the ones that follow.

                                                                  jms
