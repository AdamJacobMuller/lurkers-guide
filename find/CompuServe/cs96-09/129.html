<pre> Laurence Moroney &lt;100546.50@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Seems that this is going on in your story, or do you have a few
&gt; more aces up your sleeve?

       Thanks.  The portrayal of their motives is somewhat more
elaborate, but the sense is there, and as you yourself note, there's a
certain cold logic there which can be agreed with at some level.

                                                                  jms
