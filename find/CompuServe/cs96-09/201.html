       Two different things...the allies of the shadows can know about
us, can have used influence to start infiltrating the Psi Corps, long
before we found out about them.  And bear in mind that Earth is not
monolithic; the FBI may not know what the CIA is doing.  That some in
the Psi Corps may have had something going on there doesn't mean anyone
from IPX knew about it.

                                                                  jms
