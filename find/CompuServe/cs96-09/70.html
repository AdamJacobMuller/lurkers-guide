<pre> Ron Chusid &lt;74756.3150@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Did you intentionally name your General Hague's ship the
&gt; Alexander thinking of former Nixon White House Chief of Staff and
&gt; Reagan Secretary of State Alexander (I'm in Control Here) Haig?

      I liked the sound of the name...and I was thinking more of the
Hague as a place, not Haig the military guy.

                                                                  jms
