<pre> David Belt &lt;72142.1365@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Are there other novels (besides Demon Night and Othersyde) that I
&gt; should know about?

      Those are my only two novels (at present); there's a TWILIGHT
ZONE anthology I wrote, but that's damned near impossible to find.

                                                                  jms
