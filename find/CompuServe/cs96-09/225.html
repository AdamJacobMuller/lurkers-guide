<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;75063.3305@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Am I correct?
&gt; Is that a Serling line you've honored us with?
&gt; Am I just nuts?

       No, it's not from anything I'm aware of, though it's a concept
that seems very natural.

                                                                  jms
