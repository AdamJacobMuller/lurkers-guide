<H2>WWE: Vorlons in the Past</H2>
<h3>Date: 02 Sep 1996 19:51:47 -0700</h3>
<pre> Bruce Probst &lt;71154.3171@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Except - where did the Vorlons come from?
&gt; In which case, the question is - why are they there?
&gt; What can they possibly know about B4 since, by their reckoning,
&gt; it's the first time it's ever made an appearance? How did they
&gt; know when and where it would turn up? If they can do it, what's
&gt; stopping the Shadows from doing it? Where does it all end?

      Well, the other obvious solution, since the Vorlons were then
out and running around and actively involved in the war of that time
period, he just sent out a signal, and they got there first.

                                                                  jms
