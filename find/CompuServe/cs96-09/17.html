       Re: the debate...the one thing I'd wanted to mention in my
closing remarks, but didn't get around to, was that religion, science,
atheism, are all just tools, neither better nor worse than the people
who use them.  They are part of our attempt to understand the universe
and our role in it.  They can be used for good or ill, depending on
who's involved and what they're after.

                                                                  jms
