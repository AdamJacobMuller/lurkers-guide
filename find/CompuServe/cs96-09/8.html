<pre> Simon Pallett &lt;101523.507@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; How much truth is there to the Minbari's beliefs, beyond the
&gt; spiritual truth which the religious caste believe, of course?

      It has some bearing, in a way, but more in a thematic than
literal sense.

                                                                  jms
