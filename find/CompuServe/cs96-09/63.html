<pre> Alan Mulvie &lt;100566.1444@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Could the alligator your gonna pull on us be the fact that
&gt; Babylon 5 is gonna get blown away at the end of season 3 or early
&gt; season 4? Perhaps this is Z day?
&gt; Will happen before the end of the 5 years?
&gt; Will it happen soon?

       We'll have to see...obviously I won't just say what's what
ahead of time.

                                                                  jms
