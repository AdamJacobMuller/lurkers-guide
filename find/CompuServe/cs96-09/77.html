<pre> Darran Williams &lt;101656.2143@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is the October release date still on schedule as I expect Chris
&gt; must also be busy preparing to score season 4?

       I think they're going to go closer to November, to capitalize
on the PR for the sweeps.

                                                                  jms
