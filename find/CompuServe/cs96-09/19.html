<pre> Rebecca Eschliman &lt;76072.2345@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is this length of post longer because of CGI?
&gt; In other words, how does this compare with a series such as
&gt; "Murder She Wrote?"

      No, that's pretty much uniform whether it's a big CGI episode or
not. You need time to edit it, do all the sound work, whatever EFX are
needed, do your final color-correction, mixes...on and on.

                                                                  jms
