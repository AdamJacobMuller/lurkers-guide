       Yeah, the channel 4 reference was a nod to the UK.  Wondered if
it'd get noticed....

       Good point, when you do a battle like that...what do you do
next that won't seem anticlimatic?  Usually you save something like
that for your last episode of the season, not your next-to-last, or
you've blown your big EFX show 1 show early.  It makes for a real
challenge...what do you do to follow THAT up?

       I think we figured it out....

                                                                  jms
