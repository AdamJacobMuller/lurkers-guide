<pre> James &amp; Deb's &lt;101355.3704@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Joe, Just a quick question after watching your most amazing
&gt; episode ever.What happened to all the ships that were ment to be
&gt; guarding Babylon 5.All i could see used was the star furieries?

       Most would've been getting repaired from their recent
engagement. And the shadows phased in too close to B5 for either ship
to ship combat, or anything from Epsilon 3.  Any attack on them
would've also destroyed B5.

                                                                  jms
