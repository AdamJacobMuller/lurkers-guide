<pre> Alan Mulvie &lt;100566.1444@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; " Who said they were speaking English?

       Yes, if you have a translater in the room...but if you have two
Narns speaking in a room, they're not going to need a translator in
there with them.

                                                                  jms
