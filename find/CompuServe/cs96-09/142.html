<H2>Early Word on Year 5?</H2>
<h3>Date: 18 Sep 1996 16:09:23 -0700</h3>
<pre> Kevin P. Kenney &lt;104102.352@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Assuming the ratings only go up in November, and considering WB's
&gt; apparant pride in the Hugo, do you think there's any chance about
&gt; getting the nod for year 5 any earlier than the last minute this
&gt; year? Say, after the Broadcasters' next shindig in Vegas (early
&gt; '97)? And have you handed out any scripting chores yet, or it this
&gt; also waiting on Nov.? Which episode number, if so?

       It's way too early to judge the impact of any of that stuff.

                                                                  jms
