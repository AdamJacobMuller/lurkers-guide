<pre> Tony Cherrington &lt;100770.3121@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I have just watched Shadow Dancing, and I felt I had to finaly
&gt; take the plunge and say publicly *thanks*, Have you any idea of
&gt; what the next seven days are going to be like ?

       Thanks.  If we come even close to someday being classified as
literature, that would be a good thing; a chance to show you can tell
a quality SF story for television.  But the day they put out a Cliff's
Notes version of the series, I'm leaving for the Arctic Circle.

                                                                  jms
