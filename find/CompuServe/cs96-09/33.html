"The truth is you don't like it when I take the show to task, but
instead of getting a calm arguement, I get nasty comments."

      Nope,  Not the truth.  Because the truth is that your opinion(s)
about the show generally take up, oh, maybe 10% of your message(s). 
The rest of your messages are all about you...about the validity of
your opinion, the need for other people to listen to your opinion, your
reactions to other people's reactions, your position relative to other
people...you have no interest in discussing the show, good or bad.  The
interest of Peter Stathis is in talking about Peter Stathis, and his
centrality to the known universe. If what you say were the truth, you
would not have titled the message that you were here to "kick butt,"
given that the only butts around here are of the users of this system. 
Check your own first message again...the "opinion" part runs about 2 
sentences out of 25.  The rest is all about you.  Then you complain
when the discussion becomes about you when *you* set the parameters of
the discussion.

      Egotism?  Peter, your ego could be wrapped around the sun three
times and still leave room for a knot.

      You came in confrontational, with no interest in the discussion
itself, only in creating a discussion *about* the discussion...a
discussion in which Peter Stathis would stand crucified on a cross of
his own making, for his own edification.

      You're worse than sad and pathetic...you're a cliche, and a
boring one at that.  We've seen your act before, Peter, and we don't
fall for it anymore. Go bug somebody who cares.

                                                                  jms
