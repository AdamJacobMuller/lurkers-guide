<pre> Hart Trevor &lt;100705.1222@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Please can you tell me if this is case?

      No, this is still the first issue.  (Jim and his aide took a
polaroid of the big pallet of boxes going out the other day.) 
Basically, everyone's membership date is moved to when we got around to
it, so nobody loses anything.

                                                                  jms
