      Thanks.  An emotional rollercoaster is a good image for that
episode; it takes you in every direction and then just drops you.

      Re: the Revelations scene...we actually shot that entire
sequence, with the notion of possibly re-editing "Revelations" and
inserting the Melissa piece instead...sort of TV by way of soviet
revisionism...and of course it was *always* that way...what other
version was there?

                                                                  jms
