<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; With the Foundation situation does it mean that we won't get to
&gt; see these after all ?

       Actually, no, the equipment now in hand is equal to or better
than the previous stuff, so that's still a very viable option.  I just
gotta find the story to go with it.

                                                                  jms
