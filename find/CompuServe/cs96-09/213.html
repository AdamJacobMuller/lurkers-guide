      Who said they were speaking English?  In a WW II movie, when you
go to the Germans, you can understand what they're saying on the
premise that yes, it's German, but we're hearing it as English.  On the
other hand, if Garibaldi programmed them, then they may have been in
English...there's no way to tell exactly.

                                                                  jms
