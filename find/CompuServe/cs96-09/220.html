      Thanks.  Generally, I'm here for both kinds of comments...there
are brickbats, and occasional roses, and you have to learn to take them
both with a fair amount of equanimity.  Unless they're just simply
being unfair and malicious, at which point you simply take their heads
off and move on.

      But in general, I've found the criticisms here to be
even-handed, fair and often I agree with them.  The roses sustain one
between brickbat festivals.

                                                                  jms
