<pre> Richard M. Perry &lt;76461.2737@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is there anything special you plan on bringing with you?

       I tend to bring music videos and bloopers, some trailers/clips,
but no finished episodes, as WB doesn't allow screenings in front of
large audiences.

                                                                  jms
