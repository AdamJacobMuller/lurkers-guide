<pre> Dan T. Davis &lt;71121.1254@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Do you have many folks who have played multiple roles?

       Yeah, we've floated characters between human and alien from
time to time; we've used Wayne Alexander as a Narn, the actor who
played the Ombuds came back as the Markab doctor...we've basically got
a kind of alien rep company goig here.

                                                                  jms
