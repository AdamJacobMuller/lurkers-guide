<pre> Robin L. Small &lt;76640.2012@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I was wondering if/when we'll be seeing: The Walkers (Zog dudes)
&gt; from Sigma957 (what is their race/name, btw?) The Technomages
&gt; from "Geometry of Shadows"??

       She didn't know what was coming, and that worried her.  She is
most secure when she has a definite plan of action, and variables
aren't something the Minbari are good at in any event, they're very
rigid and structured.

       And we'll be seeing the Sigma walkers again in the not too
distant future.  And some of their pals.

                                                                  jms
