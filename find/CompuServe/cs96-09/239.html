<pre> Chris Croughton (UK) &lt;100014.3217@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Weird or what?

      There's always been more of a sell-through market in the UK on
tapes, so that helps.  But the bottom-line problem is that WB Video
mainly only handles guaranteed big sale stuff like their movies.  You
very rarely see ANY tv show sold on cassette from WB Home Video.  I
rather suspect they think TeeVee is beneath their notice.  We may call
in Jimmy Carter to see if he can work out a release of the hostages.

                                                                  jms
