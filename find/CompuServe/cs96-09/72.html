       What remarkable timing...John Copeland and I just got finished
with the main title for year 4, which is, again, different from last
year's. This time I wanted a whole new approach, on just about every
level, and designed the thing myself, working with John and the editors
to get the best shots and pull it all together.  It's *majorly* cool. 
We showed it to some members of the crew, and they're all jazzed by it,
they think it's our best main title ever.

                                                                  jms
