<pre> Laurence Moroney &lt;100546.50@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Couple of questions: (1) Have we seen where Delenn dropped the
&gt; snow globe before somewhere? I don't recall this image in AAITN,
&gt; was it there or elsewhere?

      Yes, the snow globe was shown as a flash-forward in "WWE-2," and
we did see that image of Sheridan in Psi Cop uniform in "All Alone."

      And thanks, it's a great ep.

                                                                  jms
