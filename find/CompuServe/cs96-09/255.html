<H2>B5 T-Shirts</H2>

<pre>      As well as going on about unlicensed B5 products, a number of
folks have been asking for info on what IS authorized.  Hence, this
note....

      One of the most popular items here at the B5 stage are the
t-shirts made by All-U.  They're color, on black, but done so in a way
that the ink and coloration isn't thick, but feels very natural with
the fabric.  They look great and wear well over time.  (They are also
the only ones making *long-sleeve* B5 t-shirts.)  We order about 3-4
cases at the start of each season, and by Christmas they're all gone. 
The crew loves 'em, and many of the cast also wear them.

      Anyway, if you'd like more info, you can order the shirts from
All-U at 1-800-424-ALLU.

                                                                  jms
