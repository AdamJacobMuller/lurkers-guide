<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Did you create that idea or was it taken from some other religion
&gt; or philosophy?

      As far as I *know*, at least, that bit about seeing your true
face revealed as you sleep is something I came up with on my own. 
There's just something I like about it, and if you've ever watched
someone's face while they're sleeping, you understand.

      Though one person did comment, "So a man's true face is all
mushed up against the pillow and drooling?"

      We don't talk anymore.

                                                                  jms
