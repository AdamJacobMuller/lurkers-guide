<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; I look (or 'lurk'?) at the Lurkers Guide on the Web so I know
&gt; that a forthcoming ep in S4 is called 'Whatever happened to Mr
&gt; Garibaldi?' but I gotta know now - is he dead?
&gt; is he having a Sinclair experience?
&gt; what?
&gt; Will we see Sheridan again?
&gt;  - on this side of the Rim at least?
&gt; Are you sure you are an atheist?

      Thank you.  (And I'm far from the last reasonable atheist on the
planet; we're just a quiet bunch, that's all.)

      As for Garibaldi and Sheridan, well, we'll have to see, won't
we?

                                                                  jms
