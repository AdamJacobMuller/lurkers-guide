<pre> Bancroft Gracey &lt;100532.1747@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; BTW, were the 'creatures' we saw - the one Sheridan shot at &amp; the
&gt; pair behind Anna in the tunnel - the actual Shadows, or more of
&gt; their (biomechanical?) servants?

      No, those were definitely shadows.

                                                                  jms
