<pre> Fiona McKenzie &lt;100705.2062@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; A question:are the 6 B5 books currently out consistant with
&gt; plot-lines to come? What's the chance of you producing some large
&gt; posters of Mira Furlan (don't know if I've spelt that correctly?)
&gt; for my friend Marco Biagi who is currently infatuated with her?

       Thanks; the books are consistent in the broad strokes, though
some of the details veer away.  That happens when you have diverse
hands working on a project.

                                                                  jms
