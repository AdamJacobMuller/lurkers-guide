<pre> Imran Naqvi &lt;100533.273@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I don't know, but the combination of seeing Delenn and John Kiss
&gt; in front af that Armada seemed a little...odd?

       I guess it's really a matter of perspective.  It depends on
what the fleet is *there* for, as well.

                                                                  jms
