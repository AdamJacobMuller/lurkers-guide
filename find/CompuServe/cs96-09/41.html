      Thanks, yeah, the countdown aspect does add a lot to this, gives
it a forward momentum and a kind of subliminal ominousness.  And as for
the Refa situation presented in counterpoint...I love how that came
out.  It's almost subversive in a way...just gives me the quiet chills.

                                                                  jms
