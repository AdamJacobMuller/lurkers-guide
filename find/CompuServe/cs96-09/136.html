       Re: my "everybody" comment...y'gotta understand, my posts here
get reposted/forwarded to at least 2-3 mailing lists, the Internet and
elsewhere, so whenever I do something that's actually stupid, or
perceived as stupid, not only do I get whomped on here, but as it
ripples out, I get to relive the experience and re-argue the arguments,
for *days*.  I'm not complaining, I knew the job was dangerous when I
took it, just point out one facet of the situation and thus my comment.

                                                                  jms
