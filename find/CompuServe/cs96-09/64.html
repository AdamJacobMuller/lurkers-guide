<pre> Alan Mulvie &lt;100566.1444@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; 1) I wonder how much of the main arc is Religion based?
&gt; Will the "enemy" be one of these or a 7th?
&gt; 3) Are the three ages of man kind based on a religious premise,
&gt; such as the three ages of History according to Joachim?

       No, the arc isn't religion based, though it does have
mythological underpinnings.  No 7's planned, and no, the ages of man
aren't based on a religious premise either.

                                                                  jms
