<pre> Arwel Parry &lt;100336.623@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; A cute kid appears on B5 and it _survives_?!?
&gt; or was the kid getting spaced in the 7 seconds that C4 cut?

      Yeah, the Minbari greeting is a hoot...there's a lot in that
episode I just like a lot.

                                                                  jms
