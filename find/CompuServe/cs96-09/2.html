<pre> Antony Jackson &lt;100025.2004@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Have you been told if B5 will be on this new station?

      No one's told me about it, and it would probably conflict with
their standing license with C4, which has first rights to the show.

                                                                  jms
