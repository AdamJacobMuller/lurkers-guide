       Whenever we step out on our own courage and dare to change our
lives to make it more in line with what we want it to be, 9 times out
of 10 it works out infinitely better than we (and others) expect.  Of
course, there's always that 10th time...but the lesson obtains.  You
can live a better life if you decide to do so and take action.
