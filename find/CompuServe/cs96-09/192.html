<pre> Martin Shaw &lt;101642.505@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is this due to some technical hitch, or is it intended to be
&gt; someone else? Did Morden get a Fatal Sun tan?
&gt; but what do they get out of it?
&gt; Now the Shadows have had a rather large setback, will the Vorlons
&gt; be prepared to intervene?

       Actually, no, that was Kosh's voice, treated the same as
always.

                                                                  jms
