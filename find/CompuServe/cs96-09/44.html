<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Is that a 'real' song, or are you also a songwriter/composer??

      No, as a rule, Harlan doesn't suggest titles; "Rock" came from
the quote from the Bible, which was later made into a gospel song, used
in the show.  So it's a real song, though I did write 2 for
"Walkabout."

      PS, please be careful as your message isn't spoiler protected,
and would give away stuff.  When possible, just remember to note the
brackets around message headers.  And thanks for the rest.
