<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; 1) Why do the Shadows and Vorlons interfere ,what do the get out
&gt; of it that they are willing to invest aeons of time and risk
&gt; their lives ? 2) The Shadows and Vorlons were supposed to be equal
&gt; in their approaches, was this a mutual accord between the two, or
&gt; did it involve other first ones ? 3) What's greener about the
&gt; greener pastures the other first ones have gone to ?

       All those get answered in the first part of season four, so I'd
rather leave it to that.

                                                                  jms
