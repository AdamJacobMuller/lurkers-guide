<pre> Neil Plucknett &lt;101371.1144@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; (1) Given that the white star was about to hit dead centre with 2
&gt; planet busters on-board, why did an echo of Kosh's voice tell
&gt; Sheridan to jump down a dirty great hole? (2) Why did the shadow
&gt; cruiser hijack Garibaldi c/w Starfury and take it back to the
&gt; homeworld ?

       Well, it was either jump or get vaporized....

       In that sense, as someone else once pointed out, Sheridan is a
hero in the Heinleinian tradition.  He does the logical thing, whatever
that is, to survive.  "Okay, I'm about to get vaporized...but if that
hole is several miles deep, it might shield me and keep me alive for
another 10 seconds. Yes, there's the *splat* at the end problem, but
I'll have 10 seconds in which to figure out that problem...."

                                                                  jms
