<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;75063.3305@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is it?
&gt; And, if it is, why is it?
&gt; Was it shot for each episode?
&gt; Since each was supposed to be of the exact same event, why risk
&gt; getting them different each time?

      Sometimes there are practical considerations in the overall
staging; when we shot the flash-forward, Melissa wasn't there, so when
she was, there was some interest in restaging things.

                                                                  jms
