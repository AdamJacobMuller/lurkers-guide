       Thanks.  Yours is the first detailed feedback I've gotten back
on the poster.  I designed it myself, with Jim Lockett then doing the
actual work of putting the darned thing together from the various bits
and pieces.  The feeling I wanted was of these old scrolls, found long,
long after the fact, and when you unroll them, looking up at the stars,
there are the faces of our characters, and the scroll tells their
stories....

                                                                  jms
