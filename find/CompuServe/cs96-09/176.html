<pre> Kevin Wood &lt;100337.272@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Do you realise it took half the evening before I was able to get
&gt; onto the B5 web page, only to find out absolutely nothing? How can
&gt; you do this to us?

      Thanks.  For me, waiting to hear reactions to the shows is
almost as hard as it must be to wait for them...and very pleasing when
they come.

                                                                  jms
