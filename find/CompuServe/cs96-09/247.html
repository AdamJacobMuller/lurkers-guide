<pre> Arwel Parry &lt;100336.623@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; It was only on my 6th viewing of "Z'ha'dum" today (the S4C
&gt; transmission) that I noticed that when Kosh appears in the mirror
&gt; behind Sheridan, he says "If you go to Z'ha'dum, will you die?" 
&gt; Were you telling us that even the Vorlons don't know everything,
&gt; or setting us up for eight months of uncertainty and doubt?

      No, he says "you will die."  Very odd...check it again.  We used
the same audio track from before.

                                                                  jms
