<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;75063.3305@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Or did you and just run out of time to fit it in?
&gt; I'm curious, did you plan to show more there and just couldn't
&gt; fit it in, given the enormous nature of the episode?

       Basically...we've got 44 or so minutes...we could've shown the
whole battle as shown, or shown Sheridan trying to sleep.  One would
have to go to make room to include the other.

                                                                  jms
