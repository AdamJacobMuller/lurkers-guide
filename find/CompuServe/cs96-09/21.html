<pre> Frank J. Furfaro &lt;74031.1005@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Have you assigned scripts to any other writers for this season?
&gt; If so, can you tell us who they are?
&gt; Also, do the Minbari have any legends foretelling that Valen will
&gt; return when he is needed, that sort of thing?

      Yeah, there are some legends about Valen returning someday, but
so far they've been only legends, nothing more.

                                                                  jms
