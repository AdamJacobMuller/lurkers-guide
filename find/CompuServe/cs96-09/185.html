<pre> Imran Naqvi &lt;100533.273@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; What is it with you?
&gt; What are you going to do to Ivanova next year?
&gt; And Garibaldi?
&gt; How on earth do I avoid eight months of spoilers?

      Thank you, and what you say is quite true: whatever else one may
say about Warner Bros., however much we may feel frustrated about the
videotape issue, or the PR, or other elements, the stone cold fact is
that they let us make this show the way we want to make it.  They don't
interfere, they don't give notes, they leave us alone.  They trust us. 
I'd rather have that trust and do the story I want, than have all 3
seasons on tape and not have it be the series I wanted to do.  If
that's the trade-off, then I take it gladly.

                                                                  jms
