<H2>Late "Avalon" question</H2>
<h3>Date: 17 Sep 1996 11:57:49 -0700</h3>
<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; My brother was wondering into my ear about whatever happened to
&gt; the sword that Michael York's character gave to Delenn in "A Late
&gt; Delivery from Avalon" -- what *did* she do with it? Does she still
&gt; have it -- use it as a back scratcher or vermin control like
&gt; Londo's kutare or what?????

       It went back to our prop department....

                                                                  jms
