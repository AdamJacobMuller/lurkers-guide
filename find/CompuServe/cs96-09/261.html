<H2>Framing a shot</H2>

<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; I was wondering when your shooting do you frame the shot for the
&gt; best possible 16:9 widescreen ratio image and then get the best
&gt; pan and scan from that, or do you always go for the best 4:3
&gt; image and just make sure that there are no unwanted booms etc in
&gt; the expanded 16:9 frame ? Is it the same process for the CGI
&gt; sequences ?

       We slide it back and forth.  Some shots are composed for
narrow, some for the wider aspect ratio.  Sometimes a character's face
is somewhat off center or out of frame for that reason.  It's whatever
looks best per shot.

                                                                  jms
