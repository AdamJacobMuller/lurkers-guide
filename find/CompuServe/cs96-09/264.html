       "What can they do, sue me?"

       Yup.  They've shut down several others doing this that way.

       "C'mon, like they're gonna sue a 17 year old."

       Nope, they'll just sue your parents.

       And bear in mind, you don't have to sue someone to get a
restraining order against them...which is what WB did to a couple of
other unlicensed SIMMS.  You (or your parents) just end up spending a
lot of time in court.

       Don't mess with the Shield.  Trust me on this.

                                                                  jms
