<pre> Bruce Probst &lt;71154.3171@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; so the Vorlons walk on, take one look at Valen, and decide that
&gt; he gets "the stamp of approval"?

       Well, Bruce, given that there's a massive war on, they just had
their major starbase destroyed, they were left without a platform from
which to stage the last part of the war...and here comes someone
offering a 6 mile long, perfectly empty and eminently useable base for
the last phase of the war, no charge...hell, I'd take him up on it too.

                                                                  jms
