      Actually, no, two episodes of TNG also got Hugos.

      But what *is* significant here is that in 43 years, only 7 Hugos
have gone to dramatic TV series; 3 to the original Twilight Zone, 4 to
Star Trek (old and new).  This is the first Hugo in 43 years to go to a
science fiction TV series other than TZ or ST.

                                                                  jms
