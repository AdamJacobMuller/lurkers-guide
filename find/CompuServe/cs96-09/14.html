<pre> SysOp Dupa T Parrot &lt;70040.104@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; How many nominations did FoN receive?

       I don't know offhand; my guess is that it was #5 in the overall
nominations list, because (I understand) they had to jump past #6 (The
Long, Twilight Struggle) to get to #7 (the DS9 episode) to find a
non-B5 candidate for the nominations list.  So we had 3 out of the top
6, and apparently two more B5 episodes were high up on the list, I
think in the top 10.

                                                                  jms
