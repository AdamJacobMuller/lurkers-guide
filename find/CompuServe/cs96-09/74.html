<pre> Neville White &lt;100335.2721@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Just wondering, but is symmetry a favourite concept of yours?
&gt; So back to the first question - a favourite concept or just a
&gt; convenient word at the time :-) ? (except that it is then what, 9
&gt; months before we see more over here?

       Thanks.  Yeah, I like symmetry...both as a word, and as a
concept. It plays into the show a lot, showing the balance that the
universe tends to impose whether we like it or not.  What goes around,
comes around.

                                                                  jms
