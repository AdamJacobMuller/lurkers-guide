<pre> PETER WADSWORTH &lt;106013.1551@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; How long ago did you get the idea though?
&gt; Will she be coming back in the future or what?
&gt; How many more seasons do you see B5 going on for?

       Thank you.  The basic storyline for B5 was conceived by me back
around 1986, the pilot movie was written in 1987, and it took us 5
years to sell the show.

                                                                  jms
