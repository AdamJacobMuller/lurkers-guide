<pre> Scott Baker &lt;76072.1744@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; If I may ask, what do you mean when you reference writting
&gt; "tools" you've developed, and how do you know when there working?

      Tools are tools...learning how to use narrative in a scene, and
narration over a scene, as different things...using visual
counterpoint to a scene...different kinds of exposition, and ways to
present exposition so that it doesn't *feel* like exposition...it's all
intuitive.

                                                                  jms
