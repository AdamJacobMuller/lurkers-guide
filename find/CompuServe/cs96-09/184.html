<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Sheriden : given that the White Star has Vorlon technology, that
&gt; Vorlon ships have some sentience and that there was a white light
&gt; flash before the nuclear explosion, can I assume (stupid
&gt; question, I know) that the sentient part of the White Star was
&gt; saving itself and Sheriden by leaving the White Star early enough
&gt; to catch the captain and dive deep enough to use the protection
&gt; of the planet's mass? Any chance of you casting some light?
&gt; With best wishes for next season - do I really have to wait until
&gt; July??

      No, the White Star didn't have any substantial consciousness to
eject before impact.  It's gone.

      And thanks, on it all...G'Kar's final litany is very moving, and
the music throughout works so well...as you say, it's going to be hard
to beat.

      But that's what we do around here.  Because if we ain't pushing
it every day to get better, what's the point of living?

      Having now seen the first two finished S4 episodes...I think
people are going to be pleased.  What strikes me about the new season
is that it seems suddenly very mature, more filmic...everyone's very
excited about it here.

                                                                  jms
