      Well, you combine the release of 2,000 prisoners, many of whom
were likely resistance fighters, and the payback to one who
orchestrated the bombing of Narn, and that adds up to a pretty good
incentive to get Refa even WITHOUT Londo's presence in the deal.

                                                                  jms
