<H2>Publicity?</H2>
<h3>Date: 22 Sep 1996 21:48:54 -0700</h3>
<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Do you know if WB is going to do any kind of publicity here in
&gt; the US for the last couple of season 3 shows because of the
&gt; Melissa Gilbert/Bruce Boxleitner connections? Will we be seeing
&gt; them on Entertainment Tonight promoting the show?

      I think the publicity will only come in for 322, for Melissa's
appearance there, not in anything before that.  They only promote
shows that fall within sweeps periods.

                                                                  jms
