<pre> Simon Pallett &lt;101523.507@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; In other words, will he, in the light of the events in this
&gt; episode, ever take action to stop Londo's campaign? I'm not
&gt; inferring that it might be major action, such as leaving Londo's
&gt; side, or turning against him openly, but might he now consider
&gt; 'dropping Londo in it', to coin a phrase? (Oh, and I take it that
&gt; the Minbari language is more logical than our own, in terms of
&gt; word definitions?

      I don't know if Vir really has anywhere else to go....

      And thanks.

                                                                  jms
