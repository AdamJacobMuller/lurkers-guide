<H2>NEW SIMM GROUP FOR B5</H2>
<h3>Date: 30 Sep 1996 17:59:04 -0700</h3>
<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; How will the forth coming B5 role playing game, supposedly being
&gt; created be Chameleon Eclectic Games, be effected by copyrights? 
&gt; Will everyone who runs a campaign need to be licensed and
&gt; authorized by WB &lt;which seems a bit rediculous, but seems to be
&gt; in effect what you are saying here&gt; or is it covered by the game
&gt; company's authorization? Furthermore what would happen if someone
&gt; were to run an online game (say in GO RPGAMES) using these rules?

       The use of the Chameleon game is fully covered by their
license.  If one is having online games using that, for which users are
paying access time, that's something I don't know.  I'll have to find
out.

                                                                  jms
