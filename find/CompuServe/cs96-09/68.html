<pre> Rebecca Eschliman &lt;76072.2345@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Do you ever deliberately set out to commemorate people you've
&gt; known when you write a story? Do you find that, once you've
&gt; written the story, you have inadvertently commemorated people
&gt; you've known?

      I don't know if commemorate is the right word for what you're
asking... you wanna take another stab at that and clarify?  This can
cover everything from Tuckerizing to homage to using friends or
whatever.

                                                                  jms
