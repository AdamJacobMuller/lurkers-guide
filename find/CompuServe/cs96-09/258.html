<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Could I please prod you to post the song lyrics from Walkabout
&gt; sometime soon? Pretty please, and a virtual slice of Rosie's
&gt; chocolate raspberry cake???

       Yeah, eventually I'll upload the lyrics, it's something I've
meant to do for a while, I've just been distracted lately.

                                                                  jms
