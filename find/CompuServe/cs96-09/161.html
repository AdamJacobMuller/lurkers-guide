<pre> Daniel F. Evan &lt;104377.1433@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Isn't there a way to resolve this issue?
&gt; I know you know because" you've always been here" so what is
&gt; causing all these problems?

      I've also gotten conflicting stories over what's happening
there; all I know for sure is that WB is working to rectify it.

                                                                  jms
