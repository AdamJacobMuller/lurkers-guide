<H2>BABYLON 5 SEASON FINALE</H2>
<h3>Date: 23 Sep 1996 00:37:16 -0700</h3>
<pre>{original post had no questions}

      The reason for the difference in air dates in the UK and US is
this:

      Here we have reruns.

      We get the broadcast schedule from WB, which makes all final
decisions on this matter.  Then the show starts airing.  We still have
post production to do, and the breaks for reruns give us time to finish
the episodes.

      C4 doesn't do reruns.  They run straight through.  So if they
began the season there the same time as the US, they'd run out of
finished episodes to air right around (thinking...) episode 10 or so. 
Then they'd have to wait.

      What C4 needs to do is figure out when the earliest is that the
final cuts can be delivered, then backtrack that to when they can
start.

                                                                  jms
