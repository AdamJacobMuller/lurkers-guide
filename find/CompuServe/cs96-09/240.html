<pre> Eric Baker &lt;76600.2605@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Not SFWA surely?

      Organizationally, no, SFWA doesn't make a big deal about who
sold what copies, but it *is* a point of status within SFWA -- selling
authors tend to get more attention than non-selling authors, that's
understandable -- and within the greater SF establishment.

      And yes, Norman could win a Nebula...I only used the word
"theoretically" to indicate that his work does fall within the correct
parameters (prose, SF, book form) to be nominated, but that the odds
of such a book winning would be slim at best unless the books made a
HUGE change in direction.

                                                                  jms
