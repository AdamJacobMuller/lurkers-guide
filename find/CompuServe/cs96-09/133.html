<pre> Rebecca Eschliman &lt;76072.2345@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I doubt you'll be willing to answer this until after the final
&gt; season, but why would a Minbari/Human heraldic image be central
&gt; to the Council of the League of Non-Aligned Worlds?

      Basically, it's the symbol that went up when the various sides
began to join under Sheridan and Delenn against the shadows.

                                                                  jms
