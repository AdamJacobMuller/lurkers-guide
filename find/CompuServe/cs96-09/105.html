<pre> Simon Pallett &lt;101523.507@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Are they now lying low due to the loss of Kosh, or is there some
&gt; other reason for their apparent lack of interest in the affairs
&gt; of the other races? And if there is another reason, will it be
&gt; addressed soon?

       There are other reasons, which yes, will be addressed soon....

                                                                  jms
