<H2>B5 FAN CLUB INFO!</H2>
<h3>Date: 06 Sep 1996 12:42:38 -0700</h3>
<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Can you suggest my next course of action?
&gt; And, could you let me know--if I am to send a cc of the check--to
&gt; whom and what address???

       Drop a line to Jim Lockett at jplb5@aol.com and let him know. 
Again, there were some initial problems with the post office, and we
have no way of knowing who didn't receive one of the mailed items until
we hear from them.

                                                                  jms
