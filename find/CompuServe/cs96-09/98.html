<pre> Alan Mulvie &lt;100566.1444@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I ask you if the perspective was that of Anne Sheriden?
&gt; If it was, then why did the extra's behave as if they'd seen a
&gt; ghost? Is she gonna re-appear next week?
&gt; Or was she credited purely to allow a credit before Anne?
&gt; ie was the character important or was it artistic licence?

      The script said the extras shouldn't make a big deal about
seeing her. The director did that on the set.  That's not what I had in
mind, but it isn't that big a deal...I figure she's a striking looking
woman, maybe that's a good justification.

      The ordering of credits was done to de-emphasize and hide (as
much as possible) the appearance of Melissa.

                                                                  jms
