<pre> Simon Pallett &lt;101523.507@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Well, what can I say that has not already been said?

      Thanks...the final fate of the first White Star is very moving,
like some great silver bird plunging on fire out of the sky, bringing
retribution and striking one last time.  That kind of image is a very
powerful one to me, and it works very well here.

      As for what Morden and Justin told Sheridan...I'd say it was
pretty much the truth.

                                                                  jms
