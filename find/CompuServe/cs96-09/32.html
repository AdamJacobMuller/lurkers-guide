<H2>kick butt Pt. II</H2>

<pre> Richard M. Perry &lt;76461.2737@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Ya don't say?
&gt; Well I'm just shocked, you mean there's aliens on B5?
&gt; Secondary stories?!?
&gt; Just how big is this skyscraper anyway?
&gt; A skyscraper in flatland, who'd have thought it possible?
&gt; Care to be reconsidered, oh great one?

       By the way, you'll note that since coming on this last strafing
run, Stathis hasn't logged on to read any of the replies.  And
consequently hasn't responded.  Because it doesn't really matter to
him.  He just likes to swoop in here and get people upset, then swoop
out, amusing himself with the notion of everybody scrambling
around...then he waits a bit, then he does it again.

       A truly demented and sad individual.

                                                                  jms
