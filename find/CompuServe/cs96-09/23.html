<pre> Simon Pallett &lt;101523.507@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Oh yeah, I was wondering: do you have any special provisions for
&gt; feline viewers of B5?

       I'm not suprised...the cat's probably keeping an eye out for
shadows. Cats are well-known shadow-detectors, you know.  Whenever you
see one looking up into a corner of the room, and you don't see
anything there, now you know what they're *really* seeing....

                                                                  jms
