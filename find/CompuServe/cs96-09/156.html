       That's terrific, congratulations, and thanks for staying with
the effort.  They do pay off.

       What's been interesting is that lately, the reruns of B5 are
pulling in numbers very close to the *original broadcast*.  Everyone at
WB has noticed this, and given the number of stations that have
recently moved B5 back into prime time, or given us back a second run,
I think they're noticing as well.

                                                                  jms
