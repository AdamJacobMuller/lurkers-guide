<pre> Chas T Freund &lt;75036.160@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Or is it something else?
&gt; If they aren't loyal to G'Kar, why not?

      Narn is somewhat factionalized itself, as is every world; there
are different followers of different denominations of sometimes similar
basic beliefs.  Catholics and Protestants are both members of the same
faith, but a Protestant doesn't recognize the power of the Pope;
neither does a Mormon, or a Lutheran.  Similarly, not everyone invests
G'Quon with the same amount of reverence or credibility.  And G'Kar can
call upon those who believe similarly to send out an expedition, but
may not have the clout in the rest of the goverment to do much more
afterward.

      And yes, initially the shadows had no interest in the Narns,
until such time as the Narns, led by G'Quon, began to engage in
sabotage and direct attacks to drive them off their homeworld.  Then
the killing started.

                                                                  jms
