<pre> Marina Waring &lt;106312.3516@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I was also wondering where you get the ideas from?

       Coming up with ideas is easy, as long as you know who your
characters are and what they want and what the world is like around
them.  It's like knowing what a good friend will say when they bump
their shin into the coffee table in the dark; you create any given
situation, which is itself a logical extension of the world they're in,
then drop those characters into that situation...and the story takes
care of itself.

                                                                  jms
