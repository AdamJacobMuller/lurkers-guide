<pre> Michael W. Mahoney &lt;103007.1253@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; He's just dull enough to convince himself that he's witty: "See
&gt; all the replies I got!?!"

       Thanks.  Me, I don't much care for flames or insults...it's
something I try and avoid where I can.  It's just not worth the hassle
or the bile or the angst.  You've gotta *really* provoke me to push
that particular button. I've gotten decent at it out of survival, and
simply because I'm a writer; you've gotta be out of your *mind* to go
up against any fairly decent writer in a written medium.  You won't
win.

       But for folks like the one you describe, they're not out to
win, only to validate their existence by generating a response, proving
they exist by the echo produced by their voices.  So in that, I agree
wholeheartedly with your analysis.

                                                                  jms
