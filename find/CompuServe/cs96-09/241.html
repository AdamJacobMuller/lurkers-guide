<pre> David Kuhn &lt;73532.741@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; How could Sheridan pick up enough terminal velosity to reach that
&gt; hole before the White Star blew and released 1 - 1.2 gigatons of
&gt; nuclear devistation? Now I have to wait till the October 28th
&gt; Satelite feed for a new epsiode??!!

      Well, if you hadn't spoiled yourself, you could enjoy new
episodes NOW with the rest of the country, starting this week, but
noooooo, you had to go and jump the gun, well you've made your bed,
young man, now you have to sleep in it.

      And there are shadows underneath it.

      Sleep tight.
