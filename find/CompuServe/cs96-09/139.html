<H2>Late "Avalon" question</H2>
<h3>Date: 18 Sep 1996 12:27:31 -0700</h3>
<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; No -- I meant what did *Delenn* (the character in the story) do
&gt; with the sword?

       No, you were being clear, I was just being puckish.

       Well, in theory.

       I actually haven't worked out what she did with the sword, or
who has it now.  I have several options on this, all of them
interesting, and never made the final decision.  Maybe they used it to
make the new emblem.  Lemme dwell on this.

                                                                  jms
