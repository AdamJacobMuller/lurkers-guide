       Thanks.  When I thought of that one, I just sat there and
grinned. It's so perverse, but yet so appropriate, all at the same
time.  Just to further add a bit of creepiness to it, in the sound mix
I had the editors verb up the music toward the fade out, so it had a
slightly distorted edge to it.  The details are everything in a scene
like that.

                                                                  jms
