<H2>B5ers on SF Vortex</H2>
<h3>Date: 26 Sep 1996 20:53:29 -0700</h3>
<pre>      As a general advisory: tomorrow on the Sci Fi Channel's new
show, SF Vortex, you will find Jerry Doyle, Bruce Boxleitner and B5
producer John Copeland (on his return visit, the second of three, he's
becoming so popular there that we're now nominating him for resident
Media Sex God).  Look for them toward the latter half of the program.

                                                                  jms
