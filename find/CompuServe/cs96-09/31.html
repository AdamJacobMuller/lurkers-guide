<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Would you do one thing?
&gt; You could offer it through the fan club, as our first special???
&gt; Thinking a little further, maybe only the principle cast, the
&gt; series regulars and Turhan Bey?? Pretty please and a whole virtual
&gt; slice of chocolate decadence???

       It'd be difficult to get those parties all together at once,
but if it can be done, we'll try.

                                                                  jms
