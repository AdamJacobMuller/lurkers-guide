<pre> Neville White &lt;100335.2721@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; what?
&gt; I now have to wait 6+months to see what happens next in the UK???

       Thanks.  One of the things I like about the episode is the
emotional content, as it builds toward the end of the ep.  I've watched
it (in finished form) a half dozen times or more...but certain
sequences never stop being interesting.

                                                                  jms
