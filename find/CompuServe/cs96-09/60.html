<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; I presume John is in love but is it clouding his judgement ?
&gt; After spending all that time in the war room
&gt; worrying/fretting/planning I was expecting a more extreme
&gt; reaction when the 'White Stars' were revealed - maybe something
&gt; along the lines of 'Why the hell did'nt you tell me about this
&gt; before ?'

       Well, as she indicates, she didn't *have* them before.

                                                                  jms
