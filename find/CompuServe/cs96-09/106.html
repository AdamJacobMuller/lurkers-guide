<pre> Rebecca Eschliman &lt;76072.2345@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; In what other series does what seems to be arrogance in one
&gt; episode turns out to be prophecy when viewed from an episode
&gt; further down the line?

       Yeah...we're slippery that way....

                                                                  jms
