<pre> David Belt &lt;72142.1365@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; If I were to send them to you, could I impose upon you to sign
&gt; them and send them back?

       If you sent it with a self-addressed, stamped envelope or
mailer, yes, otherwise it'll sit here and I'll forget to get around to
sending it back.

                                                                  jms
