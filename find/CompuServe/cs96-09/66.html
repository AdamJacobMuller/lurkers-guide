<pre> Paul Owen &lt;100331.2357@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; In "The Rock " Wayne Alexander was a Narn G'Dan, which one was he
&gt; ? the Narn who first met G'Kar on Narn?

       He was the Narn who first met G'Kar on their homeworld; the
only one with any lines.

       Wayne has a considerably larger role in year 4 as an alien
named Lorien.

                                                                  jms
