<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;75063.3305@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Now, the obvious question: Why did everyone seem so convinced
&gt; that it was a major character who would die? Did the fans just
&gt; confuse the death of Kosh with the death of Refa and you let it
&gt; brew until we all had it dead wrong? Or is there still a death to
&gt; come?

      Well, given that Refa has been around for two years, and Keffer
was only in a few in one season, I'd hardly put them in the same
league.  Part of all this is how you define "major."  Usually, I've
refrained from using that term...I would say someone you've seen since
the first year, for instance, or an important character.

      Certainly I was primarily referring to Kosh in my original note
about all this...but a lot of folks took that and extended it past that
point, which I just let go rather than correct, because the show should
do any correcting.

                                                                  jms
