<pre> Gayle S. Stever &lt;103202.3163@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Were the people living on Grey 17 prisoners there or were they
&gt; staying there by choice?

      Depends on your definition, but basically, they were there as
part of this cult...but any good cult leader knows you should make it
just a *bit* hard for them to get out.

                                                                  jms
