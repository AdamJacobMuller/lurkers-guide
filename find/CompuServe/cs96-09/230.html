<pre> Robin L. Small &lt;76640.2012@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Now that I'm a member of the b5fc, how do I get the extra perks
&gt; on 'the station'??? is there someone I can e-mail to ask about
&gt; it???

       Well, you can email John Copeland about it at pigdog13@aol.com,
but basically, we're still waiting on approval from WB before putting
the new areas on-line, including a dedicated chat server and the Gold
Channel area, which will be for FC members *only*, whether they choose
to take up residence on the station or not, which has behind the scenes
photos I've taken, and my personal journal from the filming of most of
a season.

                                                                  jms
