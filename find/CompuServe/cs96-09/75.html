<pre> Darran Williams &lt;101656.2143@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is it a case that this scene was created long before the effects
&gt; for Severed Dreams and subsequently not included or is it still
&gt; to come ?

       No, I think the intent of my message was that it was a
foreshadowing of the big fight around B5 in "Severed," not that that
particular shot was going to be used.

                                                                  jms
