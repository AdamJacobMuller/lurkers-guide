<pre> Spencer Collyer [UK] &lt;100137.230@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Are we going to learn more of this 'big city visit' in time, or
&gt; am I just barking up the wrong tree?

         No, you're right that it was a big deal to them, but it
doesn't really center in the story much, so I don't know if it'll ever
be explored. It's just background detail at this point.

                                                                  jms
