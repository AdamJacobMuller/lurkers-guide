<H2> WoW - Z'Ha'dum </H2>
<h3>Date: 22 Sep 1996 21:48:55 -0700</h3>
<pre> George Wilson &lt;100331.723@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; "Have the Vorlons and Shadows foreseen the consequences of
&gt; Sheridan's 'Leap of Faith' at the end of Z'Ha'dum?"

      I think the two sides have been too caught up in their own
agendas to realize what was happening right under their noses until it
was too late... except for Kosh, whose last traces did what they
did...for a number of reasons.

                                                                  jms
