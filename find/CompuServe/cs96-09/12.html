      The CD rom has permission for all the cast photos used in the
screen saver, and there are literally dozens of them there.  But under
SAG rules, there are strong limitations on secondary use of full-motion
clips of the actors speaking or acting in scenes from the show.  If
they were put on this CD rom, the cost of licensing the clips from SAG
would make it too expensive to buy or produce.

                                                                  jms
