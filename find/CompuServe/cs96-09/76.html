<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; PMFJI - will there be more CDs of B5 music?
&gt; Are there going to be other writers in next season's eps?

       Chris is looking to have the new 2nd volume of B5 music out in
time to coincide with the November sweeps; I've heard the first 15
minutes, and it's great.

                                                                  jms
