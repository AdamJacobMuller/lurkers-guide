<pre> Christopher Harrison &lt;101712.2401@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Did anyone else notice that those stone like doors on Z'ha'dum
&gt; sound rather like the doors in the game Quake?

       It's just a sound of stone grinding on stone.  With a slight
animal like sound, as though entering someone's maw.  Which is what I
wanted.

                                                                  jms
