<pre> Dan T. Davis &lt;71121.1254@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; So, I take it that Refa (or at least the actor playing Refa) was
&gt; the one who said "Why me?" in your note about two deaths at the
&gt; end of the third season? If so, could you now say a little more on
&gt; this topic as to how the conversations went?

       Yes, it was with the actor who plays Refa that I had that
conversation. He was initially bummed out, figured I was doing what I
was doing in "Rock" because I wasn't happy with his performance or
something. So I pulled him aside and explained the situation, and
indicated that we'd likely use him again as an alien character, under
prosthetics.  If he hadn't done such a good job, this wouldn't have
happened, because no one would've cared about the character.

                                                                  jms
