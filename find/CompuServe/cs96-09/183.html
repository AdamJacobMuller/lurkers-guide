<pre> Simon Grierson &lt;100407.2075@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; So, can I ask if I am correct and John S is still alive?
&gt; Does this have any connection to the Season 4 episode "WHatever
&gt; happened to Mr Garibaldi"? Thridly, Julain - the "Old Guy" on
&gt; Za'Ha'Dum is the Man in the Middle? Or is he Sheridons Equal and
&gt; Opposite on the other side? Or is that Mr Morden?
&gt; So what do I think of the Shadows motives?
&gt; Has Chrstopher Franken got a bigger orchestra to work with now?
&gt; When is Channel 4 palnning to bring B5 back next year?

      Thanks....

      Obviously the questions are better answered in the series, but I
think you'll find the answers interesting.

      As for the music, no, it's the same orchestra Chris has always
used. I've seen times when people assumed he was using synth and
wasn't.  He uses the Berlin Film Symphonic Orchestra for a goodly
amount of the work for the show.

                                                                  jms
