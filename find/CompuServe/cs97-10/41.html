      The first thing out the gate is going to be the B5 guide CDrom,
which will be out next month or so.  It was done in-house by us, and
Sierra is distributing it.  It's the authoritative guide to the races,
weapons, ships, and the world of B5 itself, the locations, other
stuff...with a LOT of video from the show, and your choice of three
different guides.

                                                                  jms
