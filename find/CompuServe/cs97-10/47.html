<pre> Susan &lt;100537.1517@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Wanna know why?
&gt; You don't want to believe JMS?
&gt; But you DO believe Claudia?

      Oh, please, send this to (Hero Games) Sue...at last, a witness
that can verify what I've been saying from day one...thank you, thank
you, thankyew... I owe you my firstborn child....

      Can I repost this?  Finally, I have someone, SOMEone, outside
the company who can confirm what I've been saying, someone who doesn't
have a vested interest in the situation....

      Thank you....

                                                                  jms
