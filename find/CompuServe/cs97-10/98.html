<pre> Will Caraway &lt;73671.2434@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; If you had known that a fifth season was coming would you have
&gt; done Delenn's speech differently, and if so how?

      I don't know if I would've done hre speech differently or not,
to be honest...knowing it now, I'm not sure how I'd improve it.

                                                                  jms
