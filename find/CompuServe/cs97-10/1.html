<pre> PAUL SHEWARD &lt;100256.1563@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Just wondered if Peter was stealing it for a new hair piece for
&gt; Londo ?? How's season 5 going ?
&gt; Have you let Stephen direct any more episodes and if so has he
&gt; developed a 'mean streak' yet ?

      Stephen has directed 501, and I think is on tap for at least one
more at this point.  Overall filming is going great, and I think this
may be one of our best, certainly one of our most interesting seasons
to date.

                                                                  jms
