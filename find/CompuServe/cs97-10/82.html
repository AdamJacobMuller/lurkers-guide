<pre> Pam Jernigan &lt;75540.2554@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Was that filmed for this spot, or recycled?
&gt;  Worlds, or LAW... &lt;g&gt;

      No, that's a new shot (Claudia at the window).  She was shot for
that episode for that voice-over...we just changed one line.  The basic
thrust was that she was going to take some time to *decide* whether to
take on B5, or to take on a Warlock class destroyer.  So we just went
with the decision.

                                                                  jms
