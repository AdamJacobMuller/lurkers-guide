<pre> Susan &lt;100537.1517@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; do you read the files in here?
&gt; Will this never end?
&gt; So what would be the point of bringing Claudia back?
&gt; If Claudia really wanted to stay, why did she demand more money
&gt; for less work then, while everyone else accepted a cutback due to
&gt; the reduced budget (caused by the shift to TNT)? Losing Sinclair
&gt; didn't take away from the show, did it? Don't you think that he
&gt; can create more interesting characters? That the new character
&gt; played by Tracy Scoggins will probably turn out to be equally
&gt; interesting - didn't Sheridan turn out to be a good character? 
&gt; I guess you are a "Babylon 5" fan, aren't you? Or rather a Claudia
&gt; Christian fan?

"If Claudia really wanted to stay, why did she demand more money for
less work then, while everyone else accepted a cutback due to the
reduced budget (caused by the shift to TNT)?"

      One of the annoying tragedies of this whole thing is that the
above misinformation has gotten coin.  Nobody was asked to, or
accepted, a cutback in salary.  Every cast member got their salary
bumps this year.  The ONLY change in that respect is that series
produced for cable operate on a different residuals structure than
network (big residuals) or syndication (medium residuals)...in cable,
the amount an actor receives over double-scale is applied as an advance
against royalties.  Once that advance is burned through, which in the
case of some actors on B5 happens in just a few runs of the show, the
residuals kick in again.

      Thanks again for standing up for the facts.

                                                                  jms
