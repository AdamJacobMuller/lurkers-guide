<pre> Shawn D. Ratner &lt;73753.175@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Has the situation now changed?
&gt; Is it now a done deal for us seeing the new spinoff series in the
&gt; upcoming future?

      With luck, we hope to have this puppy finally negotiated and a
Real Deal within the next few weeks.

                                                                  jms
