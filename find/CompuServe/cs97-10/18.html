<pre> Hero Games (Sue) &lt;75162.372@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I've never known her to lie, have you?

"She also says she was never told she could do 18 shows at 18 episodes
of pay. (whether it was her agent that didn't tell her or someone else,
I don't know)"

      Actually, if you read her statement, she does NOT say that.  She
says only that she was told that the contract would read she would have
to do 22 (if she were being paid for 22).  The 18-payment issue was
never addressed by her in any of her messages one way or another. 
You're reading something in that was never actually stated.

      Meanwhile...let me put this to you concisely.  Her manager was
told about the 18/22 situation in no uncertain terms by John Copeland. 
Now, I have an agent, same as Claudia has an agent.  When I'm in
negotiations with someone, as we're currently in negotiations with WB
for the sequel series, the agent takes detailed notes and relays
everything back to the client on terms and conditions.  Everything.  An
agent doesn't just say, "Oh, I think I'll tell my client about A, B and
C but not D, because s/he doesn't need to know that."  It simply
doesn't happen.  And at no time has Claudia EVER said, "My agent didn't
tell me this." She's simply never mentioned this aspect in any of her
posts.

"I've never known her to lie, have you?"

      Not to say otherwise, but...how long have you known her that you
can say this?  Have you known her...or have you known the character? 
I'm not saying she did here...because an omission is not a lie...I just
find it a curious thing for you to say.

                                                                  jms
