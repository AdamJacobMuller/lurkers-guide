<H2>&gt;&gt;Compliment : Endgame&lt;&lt;</H2>

<pre> David DeRubeis &lt;75221.2351@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Does a possible resolution have the ring of truth, or is it a
&gt; contrivance or cop-out? If Marcus were to use the machine, but
&gt; survive, what would be the consequence of his decision?

      Exactly.  As for Marcus, that's precisely the point.  If we do
what we do to Ivanova, then let her get bailed out, then do the same
for Marcus, it becomes a double-cheat, and that's not fair to do to the
audience.  If you bail her out but only at great cost to someone else,
it's not a cheat on either level.

      And yeah, generally, if you follow the threads, you can pick up
on where things are going.  It's something I learned on Murder, She
Wrote, where at the end, when the killer's been revealed, you should be
able to back up the tape, watch it again, and this time see all the
little bits that point to his (or her) identity.  It's basically about
playing fair with the audience.

                                                                  jms
