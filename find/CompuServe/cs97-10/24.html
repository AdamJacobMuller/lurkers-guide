"Change happens.  Sometimes it's good, sometimes not.  We (the fans)
still don't know how this change will affect the show."

      Lemme tell you a true thing.

      And I'll bank my rep on this one.

      The Lochley character has added so much to season 5, I can't
even begin to describe it.  Everyone who's seen her, has responded very
well, and likes the character enormously.  Where Ivanova's character
was sometimes a hammer to the head, Lochley is a stiletto blade between
the eyes.

                                                                  jms
