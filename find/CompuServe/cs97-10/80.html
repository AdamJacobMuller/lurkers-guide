<pre> Martin Toggweiler &lt;74041.2400@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; It seemed strange that those coming to arrest Clarke did not have
&gt; to fight through any guards, or were these his once most loyal
&gt; troops who turned on him in the end? Are there many if any scenes
&gt; from season 4 that never made it to TV, but could be edited in
&gt; for release on video? Is this Greenwich Mean Time?
&gt; Geneva Time?

      Yes, EST = GMT.

      And this episode wasn't rushed; it's what you do when you're
bringing any story to its climax.  It's like watching Aliens, going
away before the last 20 minutes, coming back and saying, "Well, it
moved awfully fast."  It has to, you're in the big moment.  No, there
isn't time for everything, there is NEVER time for everything, there's
always stuff we might want to see...but what's in Endgame is what was
always going to be in Endgame.  If I'd known there would be a 5th
season at the time, I still would've written it exactly the way it was
written.

      The collapsing was done for the most part *long* before we ever
got to this part of the season.

      It's just fast because that's what you need to do at this point.

                                                                  jms
