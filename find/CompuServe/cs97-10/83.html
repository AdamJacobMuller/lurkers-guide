"That's where I'm hopeful...that we can let the studios know our hopes
to see her in any future movies or Crusade.  Encourage other fans to
write, but to pair enthusiasm with courtesy...&lt;G&gt;."

      Two things:

      1) It wasn't the studio's choice in the first place, it's not
like they wanted her gone...she left, so there's not much point in
writing them.

      2) It's not their call in many ways on future projects in ANY
event; they basically let me write whatever I want, so it's my call.

      What the fans need to know...is that by constantly bugging me
about this and haranging me and hassling me about it...they are not
leaving me well disposed toward that prospect.  I have a tendency, when
pushed and generally honked off, to go in the exact opposite direction
of where I'm being pushed.

      Yeah, it's probably stupid and immature, and I should deal with
such hassling better...but I'm human, rumors to the contrary...and in
that respect, writers are like violins...finely tuned and highly
strung.  Don't mess with the strings.

                                                                  jms
