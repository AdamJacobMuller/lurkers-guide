<H2>Petition for Ivonava</H2>

      And to whom would you send the petition?  And when?  It wasn't
WB's decision that she leave, it was hers.  She was offered the same
deal as the rest of the cast, at the same salary bumps as everyone
else...she wanted more than could be given without a renegoatiation
that would violate our favored nations contracts with everyone
else...so here are your choices, there are no others:

1) You give her the increase (18 episodes for 22 eps pay, in the
contract), and violate the contracts of all your other actors, and
anger them and destroy the sense of fairness you've worked hard to
create over 5 years.

2) You choose to be fair and renegotiate *everyone's* contracts, and
end up without enough money to make the show anymore.

3) You offer the same deal as all the other cast members have, with
the same salary increases guaranteed in their contracts for each
season, and leave it to her to decide whether or not to come back.

We did #3.  She chose to walk away.  So if you're going to send a
petition, you may as well send it to her because it was *her* decision,
not WB, not TNT's, and not mine.

Finally, I'm finishing script #12 right now, we're more than halfway
through the writing season.  Frankly, it's too late for petitions, and
they wouldn't have any effect in any event, because it was never our
choice.  It was hers.

                                                                  jms
