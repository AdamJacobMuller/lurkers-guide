<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Are they susceptible to telepaths like the shadow vessels were?
&gt; I forget, will there be a Aggy model?
&gt; Do John Copeland and Bruce B have an interest in airship history?

"These new EA ships with Shadow tech...Are they susceptible to
telepaths like the shadow vessels were?"

      Negative...they don't have living beings as CPUs, they're still
working at adapting the basic tech, the other stuff is still a bit
advanced.

"By the way, the EA adaptation to the shadow tech is accurately done.
Keep the basic Omega design and modify where needed."

      Got it in one.

"Do John Copeland and Bruce B have an interest in airship history?"

      Please...these guys are the biggest airplane buffs I've ever
met.
