<pre> Ron Chusid &lt;74756.3150@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Was he good guy or a bad guy?

      Exactly.  Lefcourt does not think that his job is to set policy
or overthrow presidents.  The military executes orders that emanate
from the head of the government, through the chain of command.  Once
that chain of command was changed, the orders were no longer valid.

                                                                  jms
