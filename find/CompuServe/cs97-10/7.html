<pre> Scott Miller &lt;70562.3656@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; My question is, was an entire 22 episode package sold to each
&gt; station--in which case KMSS is choosing not to air four episodes
&gt; which they've presumably paid to air--or were the final four sold
&gt; as a seperate package to the stations?

      I don't know the situation on a station-by-station basis,
unfortunately.

                                                                  jms
