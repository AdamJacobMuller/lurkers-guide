<pre> Terry C &lt;70313.1103@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Then what's the title that's on the shelves today?
&gt; It says "Limited to 100,000 units" (that's limited?

      That's not a strategy game...it's primarily a screen saver with
a small game element as an added feature.

                                                                  jms
