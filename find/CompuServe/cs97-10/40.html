&gt; Very glad thats changed, now do we get any publicity?

"Very glad thats changed, now do we get any publicity? :)  And di d
this go through quickly cause CIS and AOL are now one big happy
family?"

      1) We can but hope, 2) actually, it's complicated things...but I
hope it'll all work out fine in the long run.
