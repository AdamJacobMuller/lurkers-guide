<pre> Carl Cantarella &lt;105030.3700@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I thought, "Huh?"
&gt; Which brings me back to the beginning sort of: what prompted me
&gt; to call Galoob about the B5 Micro Machines?

      The problem, as I heard it, was that the stores simply wouldn't
put them out.  They'd sit in the back room because the owner didn't
know what B5 was, and didn't want to take up the shelf space.  The nets
are full of tales of people who were told there were no B5 micros, then
after having the back room checked, found 'em...bought 'em...but the
rest never hit the shelves, just sat back there until they could be
sent back.

      Meanwhile, Galoob was being deluged with phone orders for the
things. They ran out fast, then as the store sets started to come back,
were able to fill orders of stuff that had been out of stock before.

      On the other hand...these are the sorts of stories you tell
years later at conventions...like when Mark Hammil sat for 3 hours at a
comics convention and nobody talked to him because no one had yet heard
anything about this "Star Wars" movie....

                                                                  jms
