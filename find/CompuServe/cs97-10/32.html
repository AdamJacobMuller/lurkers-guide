<pre> Rebecca Eschliman &lt;76072.2345@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Will you, in S5, be giving us any more of the sense of history
&gt; for the Drazi, Gaim or Pak'Mara that you have given us for the
&gt; Narn, Minbari and Centauri?

      Interesting timing on that question...one thing I'm getting into
this season, which I didn't have time to do before, is the other races
we've seen but haven't delved into much...the Hyach, the pak'ma'ra, a
bit more on Minbari culture, others...they've tended toward being
window dressing, and I'd like to fix that just a tad.

                                                                  jms
