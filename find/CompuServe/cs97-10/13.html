<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Does that mean that you will be finish filming season 5 before
&gt; the serie starts on TNT? Can we expect a new B5 episode once a
&gt; day?

      No, we'll be shooting through March, and the new eps go on in
January.

      You definitely won't be seeing *new* B5 eps once per day; you'll
get the first 4 seasons daily, and a new S5 episode once per week for
22 weeks.

                                                                  jms
