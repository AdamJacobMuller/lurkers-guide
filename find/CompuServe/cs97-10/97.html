<H2>421: Structure</H2>
<h3>Date: 28 Oct 1997 22:42:01 -0700</h3>
<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;75063.3305@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Would it be at all possible for you to help clarify the structure
&gt; of the new Alliance for us? Or is this something that will be made
&gt; clear in the series?

      The Rangers are independent in authority, answering only to
Delenn and Sheridan and the members of the Alliance council and
advisory board.  (In roughly descending order.)  But their jurisdiction
is exclusively in interplanetary situations between various member
races.  Each member race has the sovereign authority to govern its
people in its own way.

      The closest comparison is that overall, the states are free to
enact their own laws, but the US Government has sole claim over
international matters.  Except here the states would have far more
autonomy than is currently the rule; more like pre-Civil War America.

                                                                  jms
