<pre> Brent Barrett &lt;75063.3305@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; It's so trivial in the overall scheme of things, but who the heck
&gt; cares? Is there any chance at all of us seeing, in season five, my
&gt; absolute favorite guest character, Ta'Lon? What the heck has
&gt; happened to the guy?

      I'm considering a way to slip him back in again for a bit....

                                                                  jms
