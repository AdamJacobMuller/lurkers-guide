"...as I am a visual artist, I tend to notice lighting and
structure,etc., especially on the second (or 3rd) viewing, and the
thorny crown was striking to  my eyes, as was the sad,
dark-circles-under-the-eyes, immensely tired look on his face, which
lent to the illusion."

      It's interesting when that happens.  There's a halo around
Sheridan's head at one point when he's yelling at Delenn in the big
room in "Z'ha'dum," and, just as a pointer to something you won't see
for another year....

      When I was directing "Sleeping in Light," there's a scene with
Sheridan and a mirror.  (That's all I'll say about it, so there's no
spoiler info there.)  As John Flinn lit the shot, and angled the
mirror...I froze at what I was seeing on the monitor.  I called John
over, and pointed to it.  "Do you see what I see?"  It took him a
moment, but then his eyes went wide, and by his own reckoning, "the
skin on my arms crawled."  He turned to the guys dressing the set and
said, in a very loud, clear voice, "NOBODY TOUCHES THAT MIRROR!  YOU
HEAR ME!?  NOBODY!"

      It's not a big...but it's a pretty cool unintended illusion
(though once we saw it, we kept it).

                                                                  jms
