<pre> Rebecca Eschliman &lt;76072.2345@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Should you get the go-ahead (under acceptable terms to you) to do
&gt; a B5 feature film, would you be able to do it at the current
&gt; Babylonian facilities, or would the scope of such a project force
&gt; you to relocate? And, as a corollary, would you be able to apply
&gt; the "Babylonian model" of efficient production to a feature film,
&gt; or does it best serve the interlocking demands of a TV series?

"Should you get the go-ahead (under acceptable terms to you) to do a
B5 feature film, would you be able to do it at the current Babylonian
facilities, or would the scope of such a project force you to
relocate?"

      We'd do a lot of the indoors stuff here, to take advantage of
standing sets for some of it, but for other parts we'd have to go on
location and other stuff.

"And, as a corollary, would you be able to apply the "Babylonian
model" of efficient production to a feature film, or does it best serve
the interlocking demands of a TV series?"

      Yes, but in different ways.  For instance, the CGI is not
rendered at a level greater than can be handled by TV screens
(including HDTV) because it's a waste, you'll never see the
difference...but for a feature you'd have to render at a higher
resolution.  So there's a lot that would apply, and some that wouldn't.

                                                                  jms
