"HQ people have never heard of B5, and since they overloaded on Star
Trek merchandise which didn't sell, they figured it was more of the
same."

      This kills me...and I've heard it before...because when we went
on the air, some places didn't want to carry our stuff (like the
micromachines) because it wasn't (or wasn't like) like Star Trek and
only Star Trek sells...and now they are reluctant to carry us because
they think we're like Star Trek and Star Trek DOESN'T sell anymore....

      Some days you just can't win.
