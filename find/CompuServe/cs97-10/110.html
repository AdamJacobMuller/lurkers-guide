<pre> Steven K. Andeweg &lt;72143.674@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; When you started the computer program that ran the CGI for that
&gt; episode, just exactly how many homeowners in southern California
&gt; lost power? I mean, the Agamemnon coming through that flaming
&gt; explosion?

      Thanks...a hideous amount of rendering power and time went into
that episode, and the result is all there on-screen.  The only bigger
CGI feast is in the prequel, which is approximately 21% EFX, most of it
pure CGI and composites.

                                                                  jms
