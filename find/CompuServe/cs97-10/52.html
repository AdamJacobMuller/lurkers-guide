"...the symmetry and symbolism in how you structured that final
battle.  The story of Babylon 5 basically started with the Minbari
fleet coming to Earth to destroy it at the Battle of the Line.   To
have the Minbari fleet return to Earth, not to destroy humanity, but to
save it, especially along side Earth fighters and capital ships was
stunning."

      Noticed that little touch, did you....?

      What goes around, comes around.
