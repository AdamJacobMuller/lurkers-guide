<pre> Gardner L. Harris &lt;76657.3333@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is the SF R/T there still running and are you still as active as
&gt; you used to be or either CIS or AOL more or less your "homeports"
&gt; now?

      I'm still kind of everywhere...and they've got much faster
access over at GEnie now.

                                                                  jms
