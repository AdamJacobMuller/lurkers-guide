"If we want to be logical here, it really seems improbable that a
White Star could run into a piece of debris.  Ok, the pilot (Marcus)
wasn't paying attention, they were at high speeds and visability was
poor."

      Well, if you want to go back and listen to what's being said in
the episode, Marcus calls out that the navigational system was damaged,
and they were trying to repair when the big chunk of debris hit them. 
They couldn't get out of the way for that reason.

                                                                  jms
