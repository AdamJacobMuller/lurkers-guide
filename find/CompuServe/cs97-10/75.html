      No, there was no change to the gravity...what should we see to
show that the gravity was still less?  Someone like Garibaldi is still
going to weight about 75 pounds, so he's not about to go around
floating or bouncing, that's pretty solid.  I don't see many
13-year-olds walking around like they're on the moon....

                                                                  jms
