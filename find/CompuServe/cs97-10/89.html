<pre> David DeRubeis &lt;75221.2351@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Did you catch the dedication at the end?
&gt; Also, did notice that the episode was described as "Sleeping in
&gt; Light" when the satellite feed first came on, before changing at
&gt; the last second to the correct title? Fess up, Joe, where you
&gt; having a bit of fun with us? David

"My personal nit is that JMS has the sun going nova in only a million
years. This seems several orders of magnitude too soon for me."

      Actually, the computer voice specifies that it is continuing to
note atypical solar emissions...atypical meaning something unusual is
going on.
