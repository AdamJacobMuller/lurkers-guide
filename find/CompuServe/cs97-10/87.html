<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Worth spending 30 seconds on it?
&gt; Isn't artistic license good for anything anymore?
&gt; Did I miss some dialog in past episodes that established him as
&gt; obeying an order to kill civilians? Can you tell us yet what "The
&gt; ascension of the ordinary man" meant to Clarke?

"If you had time to spare in the episode (ho ho), you might have
suggested the different ratio of inertial mass to weight by having
character's feet skid out from under them when stopping, bouncing off
walls while turning corners, overbalancing on turns, or catching things
they had dropped two seconds after dropping them.  Maybe tossing a CGI
grenade."

      Except, of course, this would've looked awfully silly on camera.

      BTW, remember that Number One and Garibaldi, as well as Lyta,
have experience with living on Mars, so they would automatically
compensate.
