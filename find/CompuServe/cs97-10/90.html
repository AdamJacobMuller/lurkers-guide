"I'd just like to know why this info was important enough to pass
along to the ambassador of minbar... :)"

      Because Lennier is quite familiar with the concept of unrequited
love, and because hope burns eternal.

      Which is probably the most damnable part of unrequited love.

                                                                  jms
