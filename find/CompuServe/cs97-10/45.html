<pre> Ray Pelzer &lt;70475.1263@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Is the B5 Guide CDRom the one you considered putting passwords &amp;
&gt; locks into to release spoiler information as the new seasons
&gt; progressed?

      No, this was something we couldn't work into this
version...though there is one little extra hidden in the disk
somewhere...sort of an easter egg, something that won't come around for
almost a year in the show.

                                                                  jms
