<H2>Green Mars?</H2>
<h3>Date: 20 Oct 1997 23:42:01 -0700</h3>
<pre> David DeRubeis &lt;75221.2351@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Has Mars been terraformed to the point where the pressure is
&gt; similar to very high altitudes on Earth?

      My feeling is that there's been some small terraforming, which
has helped a little, but there's still a long way to go.

                                                                  jms
