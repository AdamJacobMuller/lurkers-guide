<pre> Craig M. Bobchin &lt;102354.3246@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; How then did Marcus manage to get a computer link to B5 to dig up
&gt; the information on the Alien Healing device?

      Because Marcus sent the signal to B5 before the fleet jumped
into hyperspace, leaving Mars, toward Earth.  We in hyperspace for the
result, the search being concluded based on what was downloaded.

                                                                  jms
