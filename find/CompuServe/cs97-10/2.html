<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Did you finish it?

      OtherSyde is actually the better book of the two, in my view.

      It's Getting Dark I shelved when I came up with a better
story...which I will write in that wonderful moment when I have
sufficient time.  About the only extracurricular project I can slip in
now on a fairly regular basis is a play I'm working on....

                                                                  jms
