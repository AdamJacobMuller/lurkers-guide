&gt; P.S. Minneapolis?!  :-)

"If this had been it, I would've walked away with a great big smile
and a full heart."

      Exactly..it doesn't *end* the story, as people kept saying, "Oh,
the arc is being finished in year 4," it provides a sense of
*resolution*, which is different altogether, and leaves plenty of room
for other planned stuff.

                                                                  jms
