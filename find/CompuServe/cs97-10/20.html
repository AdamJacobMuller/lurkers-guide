<pre>I'm putting this in a few different places, so forgive any
redundency....

We're starting to pull together the licensed B5 merchandise being put
out by the fan club, and I'm very pleased by it...especially the pins,
as noted below.  For a long time now, pirate dealers have been putting
out fake B5 Earth Alliance pins, and they've been crummily made, either
flimsy or breakable or thick and clumsy, and charging fair-sized bucks
for rotten, inferior products.  No more.  Now you can get the real
things, identical to the acual props in every single respect, and
overseen directly by Babylonian Productions to ensure that they're
accurate.  (Along with everything else here.)  But that's been a real
sore point for me for a long time, and I'm glad to have it taken care
of once and for all.

The following products are now available via the Fan Club website,
located at http://www.thestation.com (I'm omitting prices as per CIS
policy, but will say that the fanclub members get a discount on all
items).

1)  product # FCM - Fan Club Membership

This gets you the quarterly Universe Today, access to the Gold Channel
personal logs on thestation.com, and discounts on all FC products.

2) product # FCTC-01 - Fleer/Skybox Special Edition box with JMS
autograph

3) product # FCTC-02 - Fleer/Skybox Special Edition box with Bruce
Boxleitner autograph.

4) product # FCJ-01 - Earth Alliance Pin

Baked Enamel blue and gold-tone pin, just like the real ones.

5) product # FCS-04 - "The Great Maker" T-shirt

When I directed "Sleeping in Light" (422), during lunch a substantial
number of cast and crew disappeared from the set, and returned wearing
these shirts as a surprise.  A lot of people asked for these to be made
available, and now they are.  Front reads, "Shh...The Great Maker is
Directing". The back reads, "And on the seventh day we wrapped".

6) product # FCP-02 - Recognition Chart Poster

This one I like a lot because it's just stinking cool...it's a perfect
replica of the recognition poster seen in pilot ready room on B5,
struck from the same master.  It has Minbari, Shadow, and Earth ship
silhouettes, as you'd see on a WWII battleship.

7) product # FCH-01 - Aggie Hat

The product number may be revised.  This is the crew cap for The
Agamemnon, Sheridan's ship prior to being assigned to B5, seen in
"Knives" and which will be seen in the fifth season as well.  (And
thosext item:

8) product # FCH-02 - Psi Corps Hat

This is another one we've been asked to produce by fans.  The cap is
black with the Psi Corps logo on front. "The Psi Corps is your friend"
is embroidered on the back.

9) product # FCBK - Antioch Babylon 5 Calendar 1998

This is possibly the best graphic product associated with B5
publishing to date.  It's just gorgeous, with montage prints, quotes
from the series, photos galore, and many of the major events in the B5
storyline noted by date.  This is a limited edition with serialized
numbers. We have the lowest numbers available on the market.

And there are the CD's available from us, done by Christopher Franke:

  product # FCCD-01 - Original Soundtrack
  product # FCCD-02 - Messages From Earth
  product # FCCD-03 - Avalon
  product # FCCD-04 - Z'Ha'Dum
  product # FCCD-05 - Shadow Dancing
  product # FCCD-06 - Severed Dreams
  product # FCCD-07 - Walkabout

Again, all this can be obtained via the Fan Club site, which has an
order form.  Some of this has yet to be added to the form, so in the
case of short or limited orders, this will let you get a jump on things
before they're sold out.

What we're doing here is what I think should be done with this stuff:
you make what you personally would want just because you think it's
just cool....
