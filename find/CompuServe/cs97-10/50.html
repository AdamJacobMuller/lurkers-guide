"Well, it is the best written book in the Bible."

      Well...the best *story*, with some of the best writing...but
there's stuff in Proverbs, Psalms, and the Song of Solomon (which
sometimes gets a bit over-written and racy) that can give it a run for
its money.

      There was some good writing back in the old testament...before
it got all showbiz and high-concept....

                                                                  jms
