<H2>Gathering re-edit?</H2>

<pre> (blocked) asks:
&gt; Could you confirm/deny?
&gt; Also, what changes exactly will be made?

      Yep, we're working on the re-edit now.  There's still just so
much that can be done, we can't shoot new material...but it's still
going to be tighter, with additional material, new music, and new CGI
in many places.

                                                                  jms
