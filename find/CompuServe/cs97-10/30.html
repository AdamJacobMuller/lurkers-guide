"I think B5 has had a similar effect on science fiction. And the
viewer like myself has benefited."

      This has been our clarion call for the last 4-5 years.  I have
felt strongly from the beginning that the more SF on television, the
more there is competition, the less shows can rest on their laurels. 
Everybody will have to work hard to produce the best show possible when
there is competition, and the ultimate beneficiary of that is the
viewer.

                                                                  jms
