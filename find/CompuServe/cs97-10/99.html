<pre> Will Caraway &lt;73671.2434@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Anyway after watching, John and Delenn in bed my wife looks over
&gt; at me and asks "Do you suppose that her side of the bed raises up
&gt; since she doesn't like to sleep lying down?"

      They will alternate, as you'll see soon....
