<pre> Schmulenson &lt;72447.224@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; In the pilot and the first few eposides you say that Sinclair is
&gt; the last commander of Babylon 5- I find that very confusing??? Do
&gt; you plan to bring him back for another eposode?
&gt;  Spinoza too) I haven't had this much fun with a series for a
&gt; long, long time.

      Actually, Sinclair is never specified by name as the last
commander.

                                                                  jms
