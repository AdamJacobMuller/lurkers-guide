      The other game is still being developed, and it's too early to
get into the details yet.  Christy Marx is involved, though.

      RE: the guides...in the informational CD rom, you arrive by
shuttle at the station, and at customs you can choose from three
different guides: the official station tour guide (rather stuffy,
formal, only encourages you to go to the nice places), a rather shady
character who knows all the best (worst) places, and a Gaim.  The
commentaries on the places you go vary from guide to guide.

                                                                  jms
