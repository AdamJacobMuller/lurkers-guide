<pre> Carl Cantarella &lt;105030.3700@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; I noticed that in Dean Treadway's latest press release he makes
&gt; reference to the "RE-EDITED, RE-SCORED pilot movie 'The
&gt; Gathering' " as being set to premiere in January on the same
&gt; night as "In the Beginning," so I guess it's safe to assume that
&gt; you guys finally got the official go-ahead with that, correct?

      Yes, TNT has approved us to re-edit parts of The Gathering, and
to re-do the music and much of the CGI.

                                                                  jms
