<pre> Scott Miller &lt;70562.3656@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; issue of Dreamwatch?
&gt; Do you *really* expect us to believe that you don't just throw
&gt; scripts together the day before shooting like the DS9 production
&gt; staff apparently does?

      Actually, this is the one area (since you brought it up) where
we tend to shine.  Our scripts are finalized usually 4 in advance of
shooting, so the director has about a month to plan out his or her
episode.  We've found this makes all the difference in the world on
budget, and the whole look of the show.  The only changes that
generally get made are in set locations, to make things easier for the
art department.  But beyond that, there aren't massive changes (often
any changes) to dialogue, story, character, any of that; we rarely get
past 2 drafts, and again, those are mainly for production reasons.

      We've kind of fallen a bit behind this season, due to my back
and other problems, but we're catching up again.

                                                                  jms
