<pre> Randy &lt;75464.1275@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; How can this story ever end??

      And of course we had those who wondered what else there would be
to fill in a fifth year...not understanding that I have this story
worked out in at least broad strokes for the next 1,000 years....

"How can this story ever end??"

      The story never ends.  It's this part of the telling that will
end.

                                                                  jms
