<pre> David Kuhn &lt;73532.741@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt; Was anything different done for that cgi scene?

      Thanks...the only really different thing about the shot is the
length of it; usually our shots average 5-8 seconds; that one was about
15 seconds, so you have more time to get used to what you're seeing,
and absorb it, and make it real.

                                                                  jms
