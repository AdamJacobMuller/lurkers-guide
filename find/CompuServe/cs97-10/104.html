"What was wrong with the original?"

      I was new at exec producing, and deferred 'way too much to the
director, whose cut was, frankly, slow and left all the best character
moments on the cutting room floor.  We lost 14 minutes of good stuff,
which is now going to go back and we're going to tighten and make it
better, the way we do our cuts on all the episodes.

                                                                  jms
