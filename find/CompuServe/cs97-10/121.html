"it came down to contractual language vs personal assurances (thats as
short a summation as I've ever seen of this :) )... and CC  / agent
were more concerned with the former, and jms thought the latter should
be adequate"

      It was also contractual language on other sides, since giving
what was asked for would've violated our contracts with every other
member of our cast, and we couldn't do that.

                                                                  jms
