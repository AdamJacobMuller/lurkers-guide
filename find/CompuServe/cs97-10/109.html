<pre> Ron Chusid &lt;74756.3150@compuserve.com&gt; asks:
&gt;  thinking her character wasn't expendable.

"I wonder if, knowing she was to in command of B5 for the 5th season,

expendable."

      jms hums quietly to himself, looking around the room, saying
nothing

                                                                  jms
