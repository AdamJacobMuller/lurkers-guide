<h3><a name="t" href="http://www.genie.com/">GEnie</a></h3>

<p>
Because JMS has been on GEnie talking about Babylon 5 since late 1991, GEnie
is a choice place to be for a Babylon 5 fan.  On the GEnie Science Fiction
RoundTable, there are two Babylon 5 categories where JMS talks with the fans
about the show, both production and story info. Most of the information in
this FAQ came from this category. They are located at Page 471, Category 18
and 19.  Archives of past messages are available in the GEnie SFRT files
areas, along with graphics files and the interactive demos are also available
in the file area.  In honor of the fans who are involved with this group, the
specific location of Babylon 5 corresponds to the original location of the
GEnie topic (Grid Epsilon 470,18,22). A split of the GEnie SFRT in November,
1992 created the Babylon 5 category, moving the original topic into the new
category.

<p>
ftp.midwinter.com contains an
<a href="/lurk/ftp/GEnie/">archive</a>
of most of JMS' GEnie messages about Babylon 5.

<h3><a href="http://www.aol.com/" name="aol">America Online</a></h3>

<p>
America Online is the home of an official, Warner Bros.-sponsored
Babylon 5 area (keyword: Babylon5).  JMS and others participate in the
Babylon 5 message boards.  AOL is the most common venue for real-time
chats with the cast and crew of Babylon 5.  There are generally new pictures and
other files on the AOL site every Monday.

<p>
Interviews sometimes occur in the OMNI & DC-Online areas; the TV newsmagazine
EXTRA has also had some B5 events and has a number of B5 files available.
America Online users can also access the rec.arts.sf.tv.babylon5 newsgroup by
selecting EXPERT ADD NEWSGROUP from the Newsgroup screen and typing the
following: rec.arts.sf.tv.babylon5

<p>
ftp.midwinter.com contains an
<a href="/lurk/ftp/America-Online/">archive</a>
of recent JMS messages about Babylon 5, as well as transcripts of some
of the real-time chat sessions.


<h3><a href="http://www.compuserve.com/" name="cis">CompuServe</a></h3>

<p>
JMS is a regular participant on CompuServe's Babylon 5 Forum (keyword BABYLON5)
as well as the older SF &amp; Fantasy Media 1 Forum.  There are also file
libraries and weekly B5 conferences.
Much of JMS' message traffic from the B5 Forum is reposted in the Lurker's 
Guide and in weekly updates on Usenet.

<p>
An
<a href="/lurk/ftp/CompuServe/">archive</a>
of some of JMS' CompuServe messages is available.

<h3><a name="u">Other</a></h3>

<p>
JMS also frequents BIX, and lurks on other systems; there are Babylon 5
sections on other networks and BBSs around the world.   These and other
networks and BBSs contain Babylon graphic files, text files, and forwarded
JMS postings.
