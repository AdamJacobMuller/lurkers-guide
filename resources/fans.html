<h2><a name="where">Where to write to show support for Babylon 5</a></h2>

Since syndicated shows are purchased by individual stations, the most
important place to write to show your support for B5 is your
<a href="http://www.babylon5.com/cmp/support/airtime.htm">local TV station.</a>
See also the
<a href="/lurk/support/index.html">B5 Support Page</a>
for information about any ongoing letter-writing campaigns.

<p>
To reach Warner Bros., which distributes the show, write to either or both of:

<blockquote><address>
Dick Robertson<br>
President<br>
Domestic Television Distribution<br>
Warner Bros. Television<br>
4000 Warner Boulevard<br>
Burbank, CA 91522<br>
USA

<p>
Robert Daly, Chairman<br>
Warner Brothers, Inc.<br>
4000 Warner Boulevard<br>
Burbank, CA 91522</address></blockquote>

<p>
But remember, Warner Bros. already wants B5 to succeed.  It's the local
stations that determine whether the show will be made -- if enough of them sign
up to buy it, it'll continue to be produced, and if they don't, it won't, no
matter how many letters Warner Bros. gets from fans.  So please write your
local station first if you want to support B5.

<p>
To reach JMS or other members of the cast and crew, write to:

<blockquote><address>
J. Michael Straczynski<br>
C/O BABYLON 5<br>
14431 Ventura Blvd., Suite 260<br>
Sherman Oaks, CA 91423-2606<br>
USA</address></blockquote>

<p>
The "c/o Babylon 5" is very important -- your letter may be discarded in
the mailroom if that's not there.

<p>
JMS is also reachable online at <code>straczynski@genie.geis.com</code>.
Please check the Guide before asking about a particular episode; your
question may already be answered.
JMS gets a lot of mail, so don't expect a personal reply.  Also, if you have
a question of general interest, please post it to rec.arts.sf.tv.babylon5
instead of mailing it to JMS; that way everyone can benefit from the answer.

<p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="scripts">How do I submit a script?</a></h2>

<p>
All current stories are developed by JMS, because only he knows where the
overall story is going.  JMS is looking at spec scripts, selecting writers
based on their talent and understanding of the Babylon 5 universe, then giving
out assigned stories.  Babylon 5 is not accepting outside stories.  Scripts not
submitted through an agent will be returned unopened, as is standard practice.

<p>

<h2><a name="effect">What effect have fans had?</a></h2>

The location of Babylon 5 is at Grid Epsilon 470,18,22 which corresponds
to the original location of the Babylon 5 topic on GEnie (Page 470,
CAT 18, Topic 22).  The first mention of a planet's coordinates in
"Mind War" were Grid Epsilon 471,18,25 which corresponds to a topic in
the Babylon 5 Category on GEnie.

<p>
Partially due to fan response from those who saw the pilot movie or
clips, some things in the pilot movie were changed before broadcast,
and the series has been affected as well:

<ul>

<li>
The voice of Delenn is Mira Furlan's voice without any processing and
Delenn is female to begin with.  Original plans were to electronically
process her voice and have Delenn change sex during the series.

<li>
Some additional voice-over was done by Patricia Tallman to clarify one
scene in the show with Kosh in the Medlab.

<li>
The use of ISN to provide exposition about events outside the station was
suggested by Colin Stobbe on GEnie.

<li>
The branding of a Minbari that had similarities to a DS9 episode was kept
after feedback from fans about it.  It had been considered removing the
branding scene and electronically wiping the brand from the rest of the
episode. (This occurs in <a href="/lurk/guide/007.html">"The War Prayer"</a>).

<li>
When names submitted for a mega corporation and a mineral were rejected for
legal reasons, JMS went to the GEnie B5 Category and asked for suggestions.
The resulting names used are Quantium-40 for the mineral and Universal
Terraform for the company.  Q-40 is mentioned in
<a href="/lurk/guide/005.html">"The Parliament of Dreams"</a> and
<a href="/lurk/guide/006.html">"Mind War"</a>.
The waiter mentioned in "Parliament" is named for David Strauss,
who submitted Q-40.

<li>
Likewise, the name of the prospecting company in
<a href="/lurk/guide/006.html">"Mind War,"</a>
Universal Terraform, was suggested by a sysop on GEnie.

<li>
The denizens of "Downbelow" are called "lurkers," a term for users of
computer bulletin-board systems who read messages but never post.  The
idea was originally suggested, in an indirect way, by Rob Furr on GEnie.

<li>
JMS is considering revamping or killing off n'grath based partly on the
reaction by viewers.

<li>
Based on interest in the legal aspects of the Psi
Corps, JMS indicated how some of this works in
<a href="/lurk/guide/021.html">"The Quality of Mercy."</a>

<li>
In recognition of the Internet <cite>Babylon 5</cite> archive, the
first-season episode
<a href="/lurk/guide/019.html">"A Voice in the Wilderness, Part 2"</a>
features an Earth Alliance ship called the Hyperion.  (The Lurker's Guide
was originally located on www.hyperion.com; the name had to change to
www.midwinter.com in March 1997 after a legal dispute over the Hyperion
name.)
