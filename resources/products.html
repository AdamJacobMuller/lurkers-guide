	<li>
        Sierra On-Line (Oakhurst, CA), in
        conjunction with Babylonian Productions and Sonic Images, is releasing
        the ultimate Babylon 5 reference product.  It will be hitting stores the
        first week of November and contains 2 CDs.  Both CDs are hybrid PC and
        MAC.

	<p>
        The first CD (created by Babylonian Productions) is the reference guide.
        This has gobs of specs and information on ships, weapons, governments,
        people, and places to go on the ship.  One of the most impressive
        things, is the incredible amount of video clips and still images taken
        from the show.  This is a very special CD due to its unique design and
        depth of information.

	<p>
        The second CD (created by Sonic Images and Sierra) is "The Best of
        Babylon 5".  This is an enhanced music CD that has 15 tracks taken from
        Christopher Franke's 7 existing Babylon 5 CDs (Vol.1, Vol.2, and the 5
        Episodic CDs), plus 2 tracks created for Sierra's upcoming game.  Play
        the music just like any music CD, or put it in a PC or MAC and choose to
        see any of the 8 interviews, a Bio, or a trailer for Sierra's upcoming
        game.

	<p>
        As an added bonus, there will be an exclusive trading card.

Comments from JMS:

<ul>

	<p>
	<li>
	The first thing out the gate is going to be the B5 guide CDrom,
	which will be out next month or so.  It was done in-house by us, and
	Sierra is distributing it.  It's the authoritative guide to the races,
	weapons, ships, and the world of B5 itself, the locations, other
	stuff...with a LOT of video from the show, and your choice of three
	different guides.

	<p>
	<li>
	The other game is still being developed, and it's too early to
	get into the details yet.  Christy Marx is involved, though.

	<p>
	RE: the guides...in the informational CD rom, you arrive by
	shuttle at the station, and at customs you can choose from three
	different guides: the official station tour guide (rather stuffy,
	formal, only encourages you to go to the nice places), a rather shady
	character who knows all the best (worst) places, and a Gaim.  The
	commentaries on the places you go vary from guide to guide.

	<p>
	<li>
	Yes, the fan club will also carry a limited number of the
	CDroms.

	<p>
	<li>
	<em>Will the CD contain information about future events?</em><br>
	No, this was something we couldn't work into this
	version...though there is one little extra hidden in the disk
	somewhere...sort of an easter egg, something that won't come around for
	almost a year in the show.

	<p>
	<li>
	<em>About the name</em><br>
	I was very iffy on that...I am getting this vague sense that I'm
	becoming a brand name, and I'm suspicious of that sort of thing.  At
	first they wanted it in a proprietary sense, "J. Michael Straczynski's
	Guide to the Babylon 5 Universe," but I vetoed that because Jason
	Brezhinski did 90% of the actual work on the thing, researching every
	smallest detail shown in the series, and if anyone should get that
	credit, it's him.  The final title only came about through a lot of
	haggling.

</ul>

<p>
PC Magazine has a
<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/netbuyer/reviews/pcmg/1711/314001.htm">review</a>
of the CD.

<p>
<li>
<a href="http://www.soundsourceinteractive.com/bab5/bab5.htm">Babylon 5:
Shadow War</a>
is the second B5 screensaver package from Sound Source Interactive.  It contains
images from seasons three and four as well as a B5 videogame.

<p>
<li>
The first B5 screen saver by Sound Source Interactive is currently
out of print.  A note from JMS about installation:

<blockquote>
Oh...speaking of eye-popping, I've gotten a copy of the B5 Screen
Saver/Limited Edition Entertainment CD Rom, and it's nifty.  I suggest it
to everyone, with a caveat: if you're not a computer neep-neep kind of
person, have someone help you install the thing.  It took me several
passes to figure everything out.  And once you DO install it, even though
it says "do you want all the images?" and you say yes, it doesn't put them
all on.  Once you've finished -- and I'm putting this here because as far
as I can tell this isn't documented *anywhere* -- go to the setup menu,
and hit install.  Make sure your CDrom is in the drive.  Go to the
Images subdirectory on the CDrom, and you'll suddenly see 150 or so
images that were *not* installed.  Highlight all of them, copy them over
to the pdesk/images subdirectory on your hard disk, then add them, and
select them.  Most neeps out there could probably figure this out, but I
couldn't, so I pass this along for those who are as computerchip
challenged as I am.  Once it's all *there*, and actually even before that,
it's gorgeous...the images are crisp and brilliant, the full-motion video
stuff is terrific, there's music and sounds and other stuff...I can't
commend it highly enough.

<li>
Revell/Monogram produces licensed models of Babylon 5 and the
Starfury fighter.  Here's what
JMS had to say on December 17, 1997, referring to the Starfury model:

<blockquote>
The finished model just came in this week, with full shrink wrap, box, pieces,
everything...very nice.  There were some delays that came from our side, as we
worked to make it more authentic and more in keeping with how they look on
screen.  Revell was happy to cooperate, even if it delayed things a bit...with
the result that it's a better product.  (Among the things we asked for: to
reposition the forward guns, alter the tilt of the engines, texture under the
wings as well as on top, that sort of thing.)

<p>
Basically, I'd rather have it *right* than have it Tuesday.
</blockquote>

<p>
The Starfury model comes with decals to make it look like Ivanova's Starfury,
the Black Omega squadron, a Presidential escort, or the "Sea Witch."

<p>
Videotapes of season two and beyond (and possibly season one as well) will
be released in 1998 by Warner Home Video.  Here's the announcement from
JMS:

<blockquote>
      Victories come in all sizes; in some ways, this is a small one,
in other ways this is a big one.

<p>
      For four years, we bugged Warner Bros. Home Video about
releasing B5 on videocassette in retail outlets.  But WB has never
released a series before on tape, it's not something they *do*, not
sufficiently prestige when compared with their big movies.  Eventually
they were persuaded to let Columbia House try it for mail-order, for
the first season.

<p>
      And CH was *swamped* with orders.  Phones rang off the hook, and
tapes were back-ordered to try and fill the demand.

<p>
      And Warner Bros...noticed.

<p>
      And this month, they made a big announcement about the coming
release of Babylon 5 on video through retail outlets all over the
country.  I've seen the cover designs for the first batch, and they're
extremely good looking montages, each specifically designed for that
tape.  They're putting a lot of thought and effort and time into this,
and a big campaign.  I believe the first batch hits the stands in July
or August, somewhere in there.

<p>
      This is a big victory for us.  On a grand scale, it may seem
minor, but it's the most direct statement of "you were right" we've
ever had from WB, and they were sufficiently mensches to say so, and
act on it.

<p>
      If these go well, they're also talking laserdisks and DVDs down
the road, and should THAT happen, I'm going to push like hell to have
them release the widescreen versions.

<p>
      But that's the next campaign.  For now, this is a big victory
for us, and we're mighty pleased.
</blockquote>

<p>
JMS warns of pirate videos and asks for help tracking down the source:

<blockquote>
A number of folks have been spammed by a series of notes from a group called
 VulcanEntr@aol.com offering tapes of B5 bloopers and rarities.  Under any
 circumstances, NO ONE has been licensed or authorized to sell ANY B5 bloopers,
 extracts, excerpts or interviews, anywhere on the planet.  (And this goes for
 the B5 electronic press kit, which is specifically denoted as freeware and
 it's illegal to sell them.)  If you see these tapes for sale ANYwhere, be
 advised that you are dealing with stolen goods.

<p>
Back to VulcanEntr...it was brought to their attention by a fan that they did
 not have the rights to sell these tapes...they replied to the fan that they
 DID have the rights, and had verified this with the B5 production office; even
 had a convention organizer send a similar note, both threatening the fan
 slander suits for such statements (that they were bootleggers).  The
 convention organizer, Jon Bernam, of JD Productions, said that he had received
 a copy of a letter from B5 to Vulcan Entr. giving them the rights to sell this
 material.

<p>
All this was forwarded on to me...and I then contacted them and in very short
 order, VulcanEntr said that they never, ever at any time had any B5 tapes,
 that a couple of part-time employees had misused their account to put out
 these notes offering these items for sale...although Bernam stated that these
 tapes had been on a table at his convention....

<p>
VulcanEntr said they never had any knowledge of any of this, so how then did
 Bernam get a copy of a letter supposedly authorizing this?

<p>
I think the operative phrase here is, "duck and cover."  You'd think they would
 at least get their stories straight.

<p>
So consider this a fact-finding and weasel-hunting expedition.  If you ordered
 a tape from VulcanEntr, and that check has been cashed, then if Vulcan Entr.
 is correct and these tapes never existed...that's mail fraud.  If you DID get
 a copy of these tapes, it's piracy and in the purview of the FBI.

<p>
Obviously, I would prefer to continue going straight to the source for my
 answers here, but overnight BOTH parties canceled their AOL accounts and have
 vanished from sight.

Suffice to say that any information on this situation will be very much
 appreciated.  So that we can arrive at all the facts.  Meanwhile, the moral is
 to stay clear of video pirates and bootleggers.

In Europe, Australia, Japan, and other markets, the Babylon 5 pilot movie has
been released on home video (and on laserdisc in Japan), as has
<a href="/lurk/guide/018.html">"A Voice in the Wilderness"</a>

<note role=warning>
<em>Warning!</em>
Be sure not to accept a box of cards that has had the shrinkwrap removed.
That may be a sign that someone (perhaps the dealer or a distributor) has
gone through the box looking for the valuable "chaser" cards.  It is
possible for someone to tell which packs contain such cards without actually
opening the packs up.

<p>
<a href="http://www.webpress.net/skybox/news/pages/nonsport/aug2996.html">A
second set of cards</a>

Some packs of the second set of cards contain posters; for some reason, the
posters aren't listed in the card checklist.  They are:

   <li> Together Against the Shadows (To Stand Against the Dark or Perish)
   <li> Recycle:  Keep Babylon 5 Clean
   <li> Babylon 5 Earth's Best Hope

<p>
JMS had the following to say about the season-four cards on January 25, 1998:

<blockquote>
Just a general FYI...the Fleer S4 card set has just come in, and
should be appearing soon at stores.  They're gorgeous cards, with not
only the pictures on one side, but also on the same side, a line of
dialogue associated with that character that can only be seen if you
tilt the card; plus some nice (but not excessive in number) chase
cards...real nice.
