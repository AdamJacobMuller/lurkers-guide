<p>  Ivanova, on the Observation Dome, is faced with the
less-than-pleasant job of scheduling half a dozen impatient ships for
docking at B5.  To make her life more difficult, the captain of
one of the waiting ships--a Narn transport--calls in and claims
to be carrying a perishable cargo that he must deliver to
Ambassador G'Kar.  The captain is unhappy at having to wait
twenty-five minutes, and Ivanova tells him that she'll do her
best to minimize the delay.
<p>  Ivanova calls one of the maintenance crews in the docking
bays and asks them if there's any way they can open up a bay and
let the Narn transport in.  After telling Ivanova how difficult
she's making things for the maintenance crew, the foreman of the
crew tells Ivanova that she can send the Narn ship in.
<p>

A busy day in the docking bay.
<p>  Ivanova calls back the Narn transport and tells the captain
that he may dock immediately; the captain only responds, "About
time."  The Narn transport begins the docking procedure, but as
the ship enters the docking bay, there is a sudden accident
apparently caused by the bay computers.  Ivanova attempts to
alter the Narn ship's docking course, and she warns the Narn
captain not to try to pilot the ship himself.  The captain,
however, panics and starts his engines--he crashes into the side
of the docking bay, and his whole cargo load is lost.
<p>  Meanwhile, two people from the maintenance crew have been
trapped by the explosion caused when the Narn ship crashed into
the docking bay.  The two trapped people are brought out, but one
of them--the foreman's younger brother--has unfortunately been
killed.
<p>  In his quarters, meanwhile, G'Kar is observing the holy days
of G'Quan--the particular Narn religious figure that G'Kar
follows.  As he's solemnly chanting, Na'Toth interrupts him,
bringing the news about the Narn transport.  She tells him about
the accident and the destruction of the transport's entire cargo
hold; she mentions that the "G'Quan Eth" (spelling correction
pending) aboard the ship has been destroyed.  G'Kar seems
extremely distraught.
<p>
<img align="middle"
src="/lurk/gif/012/gquan.gif">
G'Kar chants a prayer.
<p>  A meeting has been called concerning the accident in the
bay.  Neeoma Connally, a labor leader on B5, and Ambassador G'Kar
attend the meeting with the usual B5 command staff.  Connally is
quite adamant in her belief that the laborers should not be
blamed for the accident.  When Sinclair suggests that the
computer malfunction in the bay could have been caused by human
error, Connally disagrees--but she claims that even if the
accident *were* caused by human error, nothing else could be
expected from an overwork and understaffed crew.  Ivanova
mentions that the accident can really be considered the fault of
the Narn captain, who panicked and started his engines against
Ivanova's direct orders, but G'Kar claims that the Narns are the
victims of this unfortunate accident -- and consequently should not
be blamed.  Connally, however, is angered by what G'Kar says --
though the Narn ship was damaged, and though all of the cargo was
destroyed, she feels the most serious catastrophe is that one of
the laborers died because the accident.  G'Kar offers perfunctory
condolences, but he maintains that the Narn captain cannot be
blamed--the captain's ship was placed in jeopardy and he reacted. 
After mentioning that he wants compensation for the damage, G'Kar
abruptly leaves, claiming he must attend to a "pressing matter."
<p>  As G'Kar leaves, Garibaldi arrives and reports to Sinclair
that the accident was indeed caused by equipment failure--it
appears that the contractors installed sub-standard parts
throughout the computer system.  Garibaldi explains that it was
probably by using these sub-standard microchips that the
contractors could make such a low bid for the installation.  When
Ivanova explains how they'll have to reroute traffic to the other
docking bays until new microchips can be installed in the damaged
bay, Connally notes, "The problems dockside run deeper than a few
microchips, commander."  Sinclair tells Connally that he
understands and that he's been trying to get the Senate to
allocate a larger budget to B5.  The meeting ends, and after
Connally leaves, Sinclair is notified that he has a Gold Channel
transmission from Senator Hidoshi--about the new budget.
<p>  Because all of the cargo on the Narn transport has been
destroyed, G'Kar is desperately trying to find someone who can
sell him a new "G'Quan Eth."  Unfortunately for him, nobody seems
to have any.  Ambassador Mollari walks over to G'Kar and mentions
that he's heard about the accident in the cargo bay.  "If there
is anything I can do to be of assistance, you will let me know,
yes?" asks Londo.
<p>
<img align="middle"
src="/lurk/gif/012/taunt.gif">
Londo taunts G'Kar.
<p>  "No," replies G'Kar--and Londo walks away, laughing.  As
Londo leaves, Na'Toth walks up to G'Kar and tells him that her
research shows that nobody will be able to deliver a G'Quan Eth
in time for G'Kar's impending religious ceremony.  "However,"
Na'Toth continues, "according to import records, there is one
being on the station who has it.... Ambassador Mollari."  Londo,
from the other side of the room, laughs a loud, shrill laugh at
G'Kar and exits abruptly.
<p>  "Why does the universe hate me?" asks G'Kar.
<p>  Meanwhile, Sinclair is speaking with Senator Hidoshi. 
Sinclair is disappointed that the budget was not increased--he
claims that promises were made to him.  
<p>  "Political realities sometimes take precedence over good
intentions," replies Hidoshi.  "If President Santiago can turn
things around--at that time, you may receive *some* of the money
you requested."  When Sinclair responds that there are certain
safety concerns that won't wait for the government to turn things
around, Hidoshi responds, "Our experts have assured us that your
new budget is more than sufficient for safe and efficient running
of Babylon 5.  Commander, I have every confidence that you will
make it work."
<p>  After Hidoshi closes the channel, Garibaldi tells Sinclair
that the news about the budget has already become common
knowledge on B5--the station's business channels are broadcasting
it.  Sinclair calls for a meeting with Connally; Garibaldi points
out that Connally will be quite upset because the dock workers
didn't get any pay raises, money for new workers, or funds for
upgrading equipment.  Sinclair isn't surprised, however; he knows
that since the workers' contracts prohibit them from quitting or
going on strike, the Senate has no incentive to give the workers
anything.
<p>  Ivanova, from the other end of the Observation Dome, calls
Sinclair and Garibaldi over.  She explains that the dock workers
are all calling in sick; when Sinclair asks how serious the
problem is, Ivanova replies, "Well, as far as we can determine,
none of them are actually ill.  They're just calling in sick."
<p>  "In other words, we have an illegal strike on our hands,"
points out Sinclair.
<p>  The dock workers have gathered near the docking bay and are
airing their grievances--rather loudly and vociferously.  "How
much more of this do they expect us to take?" asks one worker. 
"I say strike," says another, and the whole crowd begins
chanting, "Strike!  Strike!  Strike!"
<p>  Connally interrupts them angrily:  "Stop it.... I don't want
to hear the word 'strike' any more," she tells them.  She says
that they'll listen to all of the complaints, but she tells the
workers to "try to keep a cool head during the management
negotiation."  Suddenly, Garibaldi arrives and walks over to
Connally--he wants to escort her to Sinclair, who has already
requested twice that she see him.  "I've been tied up.  I got a
lot of sick workers here," Connally replies.
<p>  When the workers start to pretend to cough, Garibaldi is
annoyed.  "You think this is funny, huh?  Well, I don't."
<p>  "We're as serious as a rip in a spacesuit," replies
Connally, "and we want the Senate and Commander Sinclair to know
it."
<p>  "By staging an illegal strike?" asks Garibaldi.  "I thought
you were smarter than that."
<p>  "Sinclair and Ivanova are career military," replies
Connally.  "I don't expect them to understand.  But I figure you
for blue collar under all that Earthforce grey."
<p>  Garibaldi explains that he understands their dilemma, but he
feels that they're handling the problem incorrectly.  He explains
to her that Sinclair wants to speak with her about other possible
solutions, and she eventually allows herself to be escorted to
Sinclair.  As they're leaving, Garibaldi tells Connally that
Sinclair wants to help, but Connally is still skeptical.
<p>  When Connally arrives, Sinclair urges her to send her people
back to work--if she doesn't, Sinclair is afraid that the Senate
might invoke the Rush Act, a law which might force Sinclair to
use troops against the striking laborers.  Connally doesn't feel
that the Senate has the "guts to do that" (because it would
inflame public opinion), but Sinclair notes that "things are
changing" on Earth and that Connally shouldn't discount the
possibility of the Rush Act being invoked.  Sinclair tells
Connally that by going this far, she's already made her point --
and Earth Central will be made aware of the laborers' grievances. 
She replies that she can't send her people back to work without
guarantees from Sinclair, but Sinclair tells her that he can't
give her any guarantees unless her people return to work. 
Sinclair asks Connally to trust him, but Connally replies that
the Senate controls the money--and she refuses to trust the
Senate.  Garibaldi points out the possible uproar of violence
that might result from a clash between the workers and the
government--he mentions how angry the workers seemed when he was
down near the bay, but Connally assures him that the workers
won't be the first to use violence--they will only defend
themselves.  When Sinclair tells her that he doesn't feel she
fully understands the consequences of her actions, she only
replies that she's quite aware of the consequences--her father
was killed during a strike on Ganymede in 2237.  "I have spent my
entire life defending workers' rights," she tells Sinclair, "and
I'm not about to stop now."  She says that her people won't
return to work until they are provided with better pay, higher
wages, and more people.
<p>
<img align="middle"
src="/lurk/gif/012/sinclair-connoly.gif">
Sinclair appeals to Connoly.
<p>  After Connally leaves, Ivanova calls Sinclair and tells him
that there is another transmission for him from Senator Hidoshi.
<p>  Meanwhile, as Londo is entering his quarters, he notices
that G'Kar is already inside.  "You left your door unlocked,
ambassador.  Careless of you.  I thought it best to sit here and
guard your room until you returned," says G'Kar.  Londo taunts
him, mentioning that the holy days of G'Quan will end very soon. 
G'Kar isn't in the mood for games, however:  "You know why I'm
here," he says.
<p>
<img align="middle"
src="/lurk/gif/012/interesting.gif">
"You know why I'm here."
<p>  "The G'Quan Eth plant, yes?" responds Londo.  "Difficult to
grow, expensive to transport, very expensive to own, but so very
important to you at this festive time."  G'Kar reluctantly tells
Londo that he wants to buy the G'Quan Eth plant.  Londo replies
that he's been saving the plant for a "special occasion"--he
explains to G'Kar that when the G'Quan Eth's seeds are dropped
into a mixture of alcohol, the results can be quite ...
enjoyable.  G'Kar grimaces, but Londo continues, "It's a shame
you Narns waste them, burning them as incense."  G'Kar angrily
interrupts Londo and asks how much Londo is willing to sell the
plant for; Londo replies, "You are asking for quite a sacrifice
from me, but in the interstellar peace and friendship, ummm,
fifty thousand commercial credits, in cash, in advance."  G'Kar
is enraged, but when he tells Londo that that price is an
outrage, Londo simply responds, "Of course it's an outrage.  The
question is, how important is your religious ceremony to you?" 
G'Kar leaves quite angrily amid Londo's loud laughing.
<p>  On the Gold Channel transmission, Hidoshi tells Sinclair
that Earth has been hearing reports of an illegal strike on
Babylon 5.  Sinclair claims that those reports are exaggerated,
though he does admit that there's a problem.  Hidoshi replies
that such a strike would endanger B5 and would set a bad
precedent for all of Earth's off-world interests.  Hidoshi tells
Sinclair that the Senate has sent Orin Zento ("our best labor
negotiator," according to Hidoshi, "[who] has stopped this kind
of thing before on many of our stations") to B5--he will be there
within twelve hours.  "I expect you to give him your full
cooperation, and that includes providing troops if he decides the
Rush Act is necessary."  Sinclair responds that it would be
dangerous to invoke the Rush Act on a station with more than one
thousand dock workers; Hidoshi replies that the presence of so
many dock workers is another "reason to end this thing decisively
before it spreads."
<p>  When Zento arrives on B5, Sinclair schedules him for a
meeting with Connally.  Zento tells Sinclair that he wants to
speak with Garibaldi; Zento wants to be ready in case he must
invoke the Rush Act.
<p>  Meanwhile, G'Kar calls Londo and tells him that he has
arranged payment for the G'Quan Eth.  Londo, however, tells G'Kar
that he has changed his mind--the G'Quan Eth is no longer for
sale.  "Consider this a small--a very tiny--portion of revenge
for what you did to our colony on Ragesh 3, and to my nephew. 
Did you think that I had forgotten that?"
<p>  G'Kar, in his quarters, is enraged at Londo.  After Londo
closes the communication channel, G'Kar yells, "I'll kill him
with my bare hands.... Sinclair can only kick my off the station
[because of diplomatic immunity].  He might even thank me!" 
After he calms down, he begins talking with Na'Toth.  He knows
she's not a follower of G'Quan; she explains that her father
followed a different religious figure than G'Quan, and her mother
"didn't believe in much of anything."  She explains that she only
believes in herself.  Eventually, G'Kar explains that there's
still one thing he can do to get the G'Quan Eth; though he says
that he hates having to use this plan, it's the only option
remaining.  He tells Na'Toth that there's something she can do to
help him, however, in case his plan fails.  Na'Toth agrees to
help.
<p>  Orin Zento arrives at a gathering of the dock workers, who
don't take particularly well to Zento's assurances that he
"understands" their situation.  When Zento tells the workers that
if they abide by their contracts and return to work, Earth
Central will look into the workers' problems; Connally, however,
replies that the workers' "problems" have already killed a man,
and as the elected representative of the workers, she can't allow
that to happen again.  Zento claims that despite the recent
accident, the government experts assure him that there are enough
dock workers on B5 for the next few years and that the workers
already have adequate equipment.  The workers react badly to this
line of argument, however--the foreman, whose brother was killed,
replies, "... you can damn well get your 'experts' to run [the]
docks."  Just as tempers begin to get hot, Sinclair suggests that
a recess be called and that the negotiations continue the
following day.  Both parties agree.
<p>  Sinclair, back in his quarters, suddenly gets a message from
Zento.  Zento tells him that he's heard rumors that the workers
have abandoned their pretense of being "sick" and have officially
declared a strike.  Sinclair tells Zento that he's sure the
rumors are no more than mere rumors, but Zento brusquely
responds, "Don't play games with me, Sinclair.  I know all about
you.  You've let this situation escalate out of all proportion,
and you can bet the Senate's going to get a full report."  Zento
warns that if Connally and the workers continue to strike, Zento
will invoke the Rush Act.  Further, Zento warns that Sinclair's
troops "had better be ready" to enforce the Act.
<p>  Just as Zento closes the channel, the communicator beeps
again.  This time, G'Kar is on the channel--he says that he must
meet with Sinclair to discuss a very important matter.  Sinclair
agrees, but only after G'Kar notes that he "wouldn't want to
burden" Sinclair further by raising this matter before an entire
assembly of the council.
<p>  Sinclair arrives at the council chambers to meet with G'Kar.
"Are you telling me this is about a flower?" asks Sinclair after
G'Kar explains the situation.
<p>  "Not just a flower, commander.  The very symbol of my
faith," replies G'Kar.  He explains that all followers of G'Quan
must perform a ritual using the G'Quan Eth plant at a particular
time in the year ("when our sun rises precisely behind the G'Quan
Mountain," says G'Kar, who also explains that people who aren't
on the Narn homeworld must observe this ritual at the same time
as those who *are* on the homeworld).  Each year, the people who
celebrate must acquire a new G'Quan Eth plant for the ritual--and
now, the only person on B5 with a G'Quan Eth is Ambassador
Mollari.  Because this ritual is the most important of G'Kar's
beliefs, because G'Kar is the highest ranking member of his faith
aboard B5 (and must therefore provide the G'Quan Eth to followers
of G'Quan on B5), and because G'Kar feels that it is sacrilege
for Londo to possess a G'Quan Eth (for the plant rightfully
belongs to the Narn, according to G'Kar, and was stolen from the
Narn homeworld during the Centauri occupation), he asks Sinclair
to help him.  Sinclair agrees to attempt to help G'Kar.
<p>  To try to get the G'Quan Eth plant for G'Kar, Sinclair
visits Londo.  Londo, however, refuses to give the plant to
G'Kar:  "You know I would do anything for you, my good friend,
Commander Sinclair--but not this.... This isn't about ...
spiritual beliefs.  G'Kar is only worried about losing face.  The
Narns--they're a barbaric people.  They're all pagans, still
worshipping their sun.  No, I would rather burn the plant than
give it to him."  Sinclair leaves, and tells G'Kar--who has been
waiting outside--that he's sorry, but that Londo would not
listen.  Sinclair, at that moment, is called to the briefing room
by Ivanova.  As the commander walks away, G'Kar calls Na'Toth and
tells her, "Proceed!"
<p>  At the briefing room, Zento and Connally are again arguing. 
The talks are obviously getting nowhere; Zento says that he
refuses to accommodate illegal strikers, and when he tells
Connally that he strongly recommends that she send her people
back to work, she simply replies, "Stuff it!"  Zento says that he
refuses to "pander to these people anymore"--he says that after
he receives confirmation from the Senate (which he claims he'll
have within the hour), he will invoke the Rush Act.
<p>
<img align="middle"
src="/lurk/gif/012/negotiation.gif">
Zento and Connally argue.
<p>  On the way to the docking bay, Sinclair urges Connally to
try to end this matter peacefully by sending her people back to
work.  She says she's sorry that this whole thing had to happen
on B5, but she also maintains that it's too late for the workers
to back down--they're tired of the abuses and they will finally
stand up for their rights.
<p>  On the Observation Dome, the reporter from ISN (cf:
<a href="/lurk/synops/004.html">"Infection"</a>)
is trying to get Sinclair to comment on the labor
situation.  When Londo and G'Kar suddenly arrive, screaming at
one another (Londo demands that Sinclair arrest G'Kar, for he
claims G'Kar has stolen a statue of a Centauri deity; G'Kar
responds that he has been in the presence of witnesses for the
past few hours and has not stolen anything; Londo replies that
G'Kar's "attack dog, Na'Toth," must have stolen it--but on
G'Kar's orders), Sinclair gets rather annoyed at the
disturbances.  He tells Londo, G'Kar, and the reporter to leave
the observation dome immediately (and threatens that if they
don't leave, he'll place them in the brig).  Londo claims that
he's going to file an official protest, while G'Kar says that
he's going to file *two* official protests.
<p>  Just as everyone leaves, Garibaldi enters.  At that moment,
Senator Hidoshi calls in.  Hidoshi tells Sinclair that--though
Hidoshi would personally want Sinclair to handle the situation as
Sinclair best sees fit--Zento has convinced a majority of the
Senate to invoke the Rush Act.  When Sinclair replies that the
only possible result of the Rush Act can be a violent
confrontation, Hidoshi says that he knows that--and he fears that
a violent confrontation is exactly what some people want. 
Sinclair reluctantly tells Garibaldi to mobilize his troops, and
asks Ivanova to bring him the full text of the Senate order.
<p>  Down in the docking bay, when the workers find out that the
Senate has invoked the Rush Act, they are angered but are
prepared to defend themselves.  When Garibaldi arrives with a few 
security officers, a fight breaks out.
<p>
<img align="middle"
src="/lurk/gif/012/riot.gif">
The workers riot.
<p> Amid the fight, Connally
is arrested and dragged away by Garibaldi.  As Garibaldi leaves
the docking bay, he meets Sinclair and tells him that the
security forces are ready to flood the bay with a somniferous gas
and arrest the dock workers while they're asleep.  Both Sinclair
and Connally are angered by the fight, and both claim that they
wanted to avoid this confrontation.  Garibaldi, however, points
out that the fight was started by the foreman whose brother was
killed; the foreman, according to Garibaldi, threw the first
punch.  Sinclair tells Garibaldi to have his men to pull out of
the docking bay.  When Sinclair enters the docking bay, the
workers temporarily calm down and let Sinclair speak.
<p>  "Under the Rush Act," begins Sinclair, "the Senate has
empowered me to end this strike.  I'm authorized to use any means
necessary."  After confirming this fact with Zento, and after
Sinclair is assured that he has Zento's full support, Sinclair
explains what "necessary means" he's going to use to stop the
strike:  First, Sinclair will reallocate 1.3 million credits from
B5's military budget in order to begin necessary upgrades of
docking equipment and to start hiring more workers.  Second,
Sinclair will declare a complete amnesty for dock workers who
have struck but who have committed no other crime.  Zento angrily
protests, but Sinclair comments that it was Zento who allowed
Sinclair to use these means by convincing the Senate to invoke
the Rush Act:  "You should never hand someone a gun unless you're
sure where they'll point it," says Sinclair.  Sinclair adds that
no charges will be pressed against the workers who were involved
in the fight against the security officers; on this point,
Garibaldi and the foreman shake hands.  Sinclair finishes by
saying that all of these actions are dependent upon the workers'
returning to work immediately; Connally agrees, and the workers
begin work again.  As the workers get back to work, Zento angrily
tells Sinclair, "You know damn well you twisted the intent of
that order, and you won't get away with it."
<p>  "I think Ms. Connally said it best the other day--'stuff
it!'" replies Sinclair.  Connally thanks Sinclair and apologizes
for underestimating him.
<p>  After Connally leaves, Garibaldi politely tells Sinclair,
"You look like week-old bread.  Why don't you get some sleep?" 
<p>  Just then, however, Ivonova calls Sinclair and tells him
that he'd better come quickly because--"G'Kar and Londo are
approximately half an inch from killing each other," she says.
<p>  When Sinclair arrives, he tells G'Kar to return Londo's
statue.  G'Kar protests--he still claims he never stole the
statue--but Sinclair isn't in the mood for games.  Next, he tells
Londo that dangerous chemical composition of the G'Quan Eth plant
makes it illegal to possess except for legitimate medical or
religious purposes.  Londo laughs, saying that the plant is no
more harmful than a bottle of Earth whiskey; Sinclair merely
tells him to file an official protest if he wishes--but to turn
over the plant anyway.  Sinclair mentions that Londo will be
fully compensated for the plant, of course.  Londo, at length,
agrees.  "I have already gotten my enjoyment from it anyway,"
says Londo.  After Londo leaves, Sinclair tells G'Kar that once
Londo's statue is returned, Sinclair will turn over the G'Quan
Eth plant to G'Kar--of course, G'Kar will compensate Londo for
it.
<p>  "Why should I turn the statue over--assuming that I knew
where it was--when it's already too late for the ceremony? 
Mollari knows that--that's why he gave in so easily."
<p>  Sinclair tells G'Kar that light travels through space. 
Therefore, although the ritual must be performed in the sunlight
that has touched the G'Quan mountain at a particular time, and
although that particular time has already passed this year, the
light that touched the G'Quan mountain ten years ago will reach
the station in a few hours.  "[The light has] been on a long
journey, but it's still the same sunlight.  Good enough for you
to conduct your ceremony--wouldn't you agree?"
<p>  "Yes, it might be.  Commander, you are a far more spiritual
man than I gave you credit for," replies G'Kar.
<p>
<img align="middle"
src="/lurk/gif/012/spiritual.gif">
"You are a far more spiritual man..."
<p>  "There are a couple of Jesuit teachers I know who might
disagree with you," says Sinclair.  When Sinclair reminds G'Kar
to return the Centauri statue, G'Kar replies that he's sure a
careful search will turn it up.  As Sinclair leaves, smiling
broadly, G'Kar thanks him.
<p>  Sinclair returns to his quarters and instructs his computer
to hold all transmissions; however, when the computer replies
that there is one transmission holding, Sinclair tells the
computer to send the message through.  The message is from
Hidoshi, who tells Sinclair that he admires what Sinclair has
done on B5 concerning the labor situation--however, the Senate
doesn't.  In this instance, however, the Senate has allowed
Sinclair's decision to stand without comment--because public
opinion is on Sinclair's side.  Hidoshi tells Sinclair that he
sympathizes with his decision--and is glad to see the discomfort
it has caused some of his colleagues (for Hidoshi's grandfather
was a dock worker himself).  He is calling just to warn Sinclair
that Zento has powerful friends, and that by embarrassing Zento,
Sinclair has made new enemies in the government.  "If I were you,
commander, I would watch things very carefully.  You are not the
most popular person in government circles right now."
<p>  After Hidoshi closes the communication, Sinclair says to
himself, "So, what else is new?" and finally goes to sleep.
<p>  Meanwhile, G'Kar is successfully carrying out his religious
ceremony.  "The gift of time, the gift of life, the gift of
wisdom, the gift of light.  For these things, were are thankful. 
For these things, we pray," says G'Kar, solemnly, and the
ceremony continues, thanks to Commander Sinclair.
