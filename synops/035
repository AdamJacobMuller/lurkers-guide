<p>
Garibaldi arrives at C&C, and asks an officer on duty where Captain
Sheridan and Commander Ivanova are.  The officer tells him that they are
in bay 13.  Garibaldi goes down there, more than a little puzzled by
their reasons for being there.

<p>
Sheridan and Ivanova stand in awe of the sight before them in the bay:
Ambassador Kosh's ship.  Sheridan finds its construction amazing and
unbelievable and asks Ivanova about it.  She tells him that for the past
two years, they haven't been able to determine much about it; their scans
barely penetrate the ship's skin.  Sheridan
reaches out to touch the ship when part of the ship pulls away and a
strange-looking device fires a beam straight at Sheridan's chest.
Ivanova tells him to back away slowly, which he does.  The device melts
back into the ship.  After Ivanova tells Sheridan a story about a
maintenance crew that was frightened away by the ship, Sheridan's
interest is piqued.  Sheridan tells her that it is time they learned
something about the Vorlons, and that he intends to begin doing just
that.  Garibaldi arrives and tells them that he needs to talk to them,
but would rather not do it in front of Kosh's ship.  The three of them
leave.  Kosh steps out from behind a corner and "speaks" to his ship.  It
replies with a few lines of strange symbols, to which Kosh nods, and then
leaves.

<p>
When Sheridan, Ivanova, and Garibaldi arrive in Sheridan's office,
Garibaldi explains that he just received a message from EarthForce that
there is a fugitive alert out for Dr. Everett Jacobs, President Clark's
former physician.  Garibaldi tells them that Jacobs has enough stolen
information to bring down the entire Earth Alliance, unless he is
stopped.  They think that he is already aboard Babylon 5, and want him
taken dead or alive.  Sheridan asks what Jacobs knows that makes him such
a threat.  Garibaldi wasn't told that, but says that, if Jacobs resists,
they are ordered to shoot to kill.

<p>
Later, Agent Derek Cranston, from Earth Special
Intelligence, arrives on the station.
Sheridan asks him why Dr. Jacobs is such a threat.  Cranston
explains that Dr. Jacobs misused his security clearance to get
information about covert missions and extremely important data, which
could throw the government into chaos and ruin their alliance with many
of the non-aligned worlds.  Cranston says that Jacobs is on Babylon 5 to
either sell the information or to find travel out of Earth-controlled
space.  Sheridan agrees to have security help, and orders Ivanova
to carefully investigate all outgoing ships.  Cranston thanks Sheridan
for his cooperation and leaves.  Garibaldi tells Sheridan that he doesn't
think Cranston is telling them everything.  Sheridan agrees, but says that
Cranston is worried about something, which makes him want to go along with
the manhunt.  Garibaldi says he thinks he knows where to begin.

<p>
<img align=middle width=128 height=96

<p>
Dr. Franklin resents the line of questioning altogether, saying that Dr.
Jacobs was a professor of his at Harvard and helped him a lot while
learning about xenobiogenics.  He tells Garibaldi that Jacobs was a
humanitarian and could not be responsible, but Garibaldi reminds him of a
time when he vouched for another doctor and the station was almost destroyed
by a biological weapon.  Dr. Franklin insists that there has been a
mistake and that Jacobs would never have sold out Earth.  "Maybe he's not the
same Dr. Jacobs you knew any more," Garibaldi suggests.

<p>
An old man wanders through a marketplace on Babylon 5, stopping at one
kiosk.  The old man tells the merchant that he heard he could obtain
"special" things from him.  The old man says he needs an
identicard, but when he tells the merchant that price is not an issue,
the merchant refuses to sell him one; the only reasons someone would be so
desperate are that they're working
for security, or are being chased by some very powerful people.  The merchant
closes his shop, and the man wanders away, but he has already been
noticed by a tall figure, watching from the shadows.

<p>
Sheridan is walking through the corridor to an elevator, when he hears an
unusual sound behind him.  He turns to see Ambassador Kosh walking away.
He catches up to him, and reminds Kosh of a council meeting.  He also
tells Kosh that he was in bay 13, and because of how much everyone still
doesn't know about the Vorlons, he and Kosh should try to understand each other.

<p>
Kosh looks at him.  "Why?"

<p>
"You tell me.  You're the one who popped into my dream when I was in that
alien ship a few weeks ago.  It felt like...I don't know, like you called
to me."

<p>
"I sought understanding.  I listened to the song.  Your thoughts became
the song."

<p>
<img align=middle width=128 height=96
src="/lurk/gif/035/song.gif">

<p>
"Has this ever happened before?"

<p>
"Once," Kosh intones, and walks away.

<p>
Agent Cranston is briefing the security troops on how to best search for
Dr. Jacobs.  Though his plan is efficient, because of the size of Babylon
5, as Zack Allen points out, it could take a long time.  Dr. Cranston
explains that, as an anti-kidnapping measure, all EarthDome personnel are
injected with an identification crystal, which can be scanned for easily.

<p>
Sheridan asks Garibaldi if he is having any problems with the security
crew.  Garibaldi tells him that he isn't, and that, because of their
efficiency, he would not like having to go up against them.  As they
walk, Sheridan notices a red ribbon tied to a nearby wall.  Sheridan
tells Garibaldi to continue to check up on them, and that he will check
in with him later to check his progress.  Sheridan exits hastily.

<p>
Sheridan, in a dark corridor, shines a strange patterns of lights into
the area ahead.  He walks forward and meets with a woman.  "The general
sent me," she tells him.  "I have a message.  You're in great danger,
Captain.  We know what you've been told.  But Dr. Jacobs is not a
traitor."  As she sets up a device to prevent their conversation
being eavesdropped upon, Sheridan asks why there is such an intensive search
out for him, and the woman explains that Earth Special Intelligence is directly
under President Clark's control, and that Jacobs represents a threat Clark
wants stopped at any cost.  Sheridan asks what the situation is, and the
woman explains what happened at the beginning of the year.

<p>
"Before President Santiago was killed aboard EarthForce One, Clark got off the
ship, claiming he had some kind of virus.  Twenty-four hours later,
EarthForce One is destroyed in an...accident, and Clark assumes the
presidency.  As Clark's personal physician, Jacobs knew it wasn't true.
If he would ever testify to that effect, it would help prove that Clark
knew what was going to happen.  But, they couldn't allow that.  If they
killed him right away, it would look suspicious, so they kept an eye on
him until they figured it was safe for the good doctor to have an
accident.  We heard about it, and we helped him escape."

<p>

<p>
She tells him
that their plans were changed because Jacobs wasn't able to meet with his
contact elsewhere, so he came to Babylon 5.  Sheridan tells her that he
can't pull his security officers off because it would mean revealing
himself, destroying everything
they've tried to build.  She says he needs to do whatever he can, because it
must be done.  They need to accumulate as much evidence as possible, and
Jacobs' testimony would be a good place to start.  She tells him to make sure
he gets the statement and gets Jacobs off the station alive.  He tells her that
he is angry things have gotten so far out of hand, and that he will
have to circumvent his own security officers.  She advises him to
work quickly, and leaves.  Sheridan calls Garibaldi, telling him to meet
with him in ten minutes.

<p>
Dr. Franklin is instructing a small group of physicians in MedLab when he
gets a call from Garibaldi.  "Hi Doc.  Just wanted to say, 'Happy
birthday,' that's all.  Catch you later."  Franklin tries to protest, and
doesn't understand the message, since it isn't his birthday, but gets the
point when he sees security officers scanning nearby.  Franklin orders
the message to replayed frame by frame, looking for anything unusual.
Several frames in, he sees two voice balloons sketched on top of the
image which read, "Meet me at my place ASAP.  Come alone.  Wear something
comfortable."

<p>
Jacobs, the old man, now in a deserted area of Downbelow, prepares an injection
which he gives to himself.  He speaks into a small recording device, and
says, "I'm...uh, I'm nearly out of stims.  I have to keep moving.  If I
fall asleep, they'll get me.  And, uh, if they get me, I uh...I don't
know if this will get to you Mary, but I'm tired.  I'm just desperately
tired.  I don't know who to turn to, who I can trust."  He is
interrupted when several security officers appear nearby, searching some
drunken lurkers.  Jacobs quickly fumbles at opening a nearby cargo elevator,
and when he does, he steps inside closes the door.  The security
offciers notice something on the scanners for just a minute, and then it
vanishes.  They decide to report it anyway.

<p>
<img align=middle width=128 height=96
src="/lurk/gif/035/recording.gif"> Jacobs makes his recording.

<p>
Garibaldi prepares to search for Jacobs by taking two PPG weapons and
dressing in extremely casual clothes.  He says that his
security crew is good, but that he has one advantage: Dr. Franklin, who
knows a lot about Dr. Jacobs, and is someone whom Dr. Jacobs knows as
well.  Franklin is afraid Garibaldi will be recognized, but Garibaldi
says that, because of his position, they rarely look at his face.  He
also puts on his disguise, a hat, and the two of them leave to begin
their mission.

<p>
Jacobs steps out of the elevator, and is immediately met by the
tall man who saw him talking to the merchant earlier.  He tries to move
away, but is met by another gentleman.  The tall man tells him that he
looks as if he doesn't belong in Downbelow, and asks him what he is
buying or selling, or if he is running away.  Jacobs says he doesn't
want any trouble and will pay whatever he wants.  "Yeah, you will," the
tall man tells him.

<p>
Jacobs is taken to another section of Downbelow, and has his
belongings taken by the two lurkers.  They search through them, searching
for something they might be able to sell.  Jacobs tries to convince
them he has nothing of value, but they soon discover otherwise when they
rip open his jacket to find a data crystal and an antique pocketwatch, which
attracts the large lurker immediately.  Its inscription reads, "Office of
the President of the Earth Alliance."  The large lurker leaves to examine
the data crystal, leaving the other behind to guard Jacobs.

<p>

<p>
Cranston explains to Sheridan and Ivanova that they have searched most of
the station and have deduced that Jacobs must be hiding in Downbelow.
Sheridan says that the sooner they get him off of Babylon 5, the better,
and that Cranston is right about him being in Downbelow.  When Ivanova
protests, Sheridan tells her that it is the only logical choice, unless
she seriously believes he might also be Downtown.  Cranston asks
where this place is, and Sheridan tells him it is the unofficial name for
the area between the hull and the water reclamation system, one of the
most unpleasant parts of the station, full of heavy machinery,
pipes, and lead.  Cranston decides that Jacobs would use lead to defeat the
scanners, and calls security to have them search Downtown instead.
Cranston leaves, and Ivanova asks him what he was talking about, telling
him that the entire area was sealed off after Babylon 5 was made
operational.  Sheridan says that he hopes trying to burn through the
walls and doors in that area will buy Garibaldi a few hours.  He then
receives a call saying that one of the ambassadors wants to see him.  He
begins to say no, but decides otherwise when he learns it is Ambassador
Kosh.  He goes off to the meeting.

<p>
Garibaldi and Franklin are questioning some of the people in a bazaar in
Downbelow, but can't find any information.  They comment on how there are
no guards down there, but Garibaldi decides it must be Captain Sheridan's
doing.  They stop to rest and to have something to eat.  While they are
chatting about Dr. Jacobs and the past, when they notice a merchant
trying to sell Jacobs' pocketwatch, which Franklin recognizes.
Garibaldi strongarms the merchant into revealing where he got the watch.

<p>
An officer goes to Cranston and tells him that they have someone on the
line who has seen Jacobs.  Cranston answers the call and talks to the man
on the other end, the same one who kidnapped Jacobs from
Downbelow.  The man says he will turn over Jacobs for 10,000 credits, to
which Cranston agrees.  The man says he will call again when he is ready
to exchange.

<p>
Sheridan arrives in Ambassador Kosh's quarters, and asks the purpose of
the meeting.  "You wanted to see me?" he asks Kosh.

<p>
"You wanted to see me."

<p>
"Well, I guess everybody does.  To see what you really are inside that
encounter suit."

<p>
"They are not ready.  They would not understand."

<p>
"Am I ready?"

<p>
"No.  You do not even understand yourself."

<p>
"Could you help me to understand you?"

<p>
"Can you help me to understand you?"

<p>
"Well, I can try.  Is that what you want?  An exchange of information?  I
tell you something about me, and you tell me something about you?"

<p>
"No.  You do not understand.  Go."  Kosh turns away.

<p>
<img align=middle width=128 height=96
src="/lurk/gif/035/go.gif">

<p>
"Damn it, what do you want?  What do you want from me?   You know, ever
since I got here, I've had the feeling that...that you've been watching
me.  The record shows you hardly ever went to council meetings until I
showed up.  When I was captured, it was you who reached out and touched
my mind.  And now you call me here?  Why?  Just to throw me out?  Are we
just toys to you?  Huh?  What do you want?"

<p>
Kosh spins around and intones angrily, "Never ask that question."

<p>
"At least I got a response out of you.  So, what'll it be, Ambassador?"

<p>
"I will teach you."

<p>
"About yourself?"

<p>
"About you.  Until you are ready."

<p>
"For what?"

<p>
"To fight legends."

<p>
The lurker guarding Dr. Jacobs hears a pounding at the door which he
thinks is his companion, Max, returning.  He opens the door, but finds
Garibaldi instead.  Garibaldi knocks the lurker out, but not before he is
stabbed in the arm.  Franklin tries to help Garibaldi up, and then unties
Dr. Jacobs.  Though they try to usher him out of there, Dr. Jacobs
insists that they have to have the data crystal, which Max took.  Garibaldi
tells Franklin and Dr. Jacobs to wait for him nearby.

<p>
Max arrives back in the room to find the other lurker tied up.  He
removes the gag from his mouth, but before the other can warn Max, Garibaldi
steps from the shadows, PPG drawn, and demands the data crystal.  He
begins shooting at Max, missing deliberately, but coming closer and
closer each time.  By the time Garibaldi shoots only an inch away from
his head, Max agrees and hands over the data crystal.

<p>
Cranston talks to Sheridan, reminding him that, in the past, internal
scanners have been used to locate radiation sources inside Babylon 5.
Sheridan tells him it required a lot of difficult rewiring, but Cranston
only wants to know why he was not informed about it.  Ivanova comes in
and tells Sheridan that Dr. Franklin needs to seem him immediately.
Sheridan leaves, and Cranston turns to Ivanova.  He asks her about the
internal scanners and how long it will take him to wire his scanners up
to Babylon 5's.  She replies coldly, obviously resenting his attitude toward
her.  She tells him that he didn't ask for the information and that there is no
way to know if the systems are compatible or if it will work.

<p>
Dr. Jacobs gives the data crystal to Sheridan and explains that it
contains the information obtained from his scans of Clark which proved he
did not suffer from a viral infection and that he has given Garibaldi
the necessary codes to unlock the data.  Garibaldi, while being treated
for his arm injury by Franklin, reminds them that they will need a
statement as well.  Sheridan says that they have another problem now that
Cranston knows they can patch their scanners into the station's internal
sensors, which would make it very easy to find Dr. Jacobs.  Franklin asks
if it is possible to get him off the station, but Garibaldi says it isn't
likely, considering they have all the docking bays covered.  "Not
entirely correct, Mr. Garibaldi," Sheridan says.

<p>
The configuration between the sensors and the scanners is complete.
Ambassador Kosh asks for permission to depart, but Sheridan won't allow
him to leave until after they scan the station.  The station is scanned,
but they don't find Dr. Jacobs.  Sheridan tells Cranston that he is angry
his station has been torn apart for no reason.  Kosh asks permission to
depart again, which Ivanova grants.  Cranston says he doesn't understand
since someone (Max) told him Jacobs was on the station.  Sheridan tells
Cransgon that he can't be too sure of any information he obtains aboard the
station.  Ivanova begins to tell Kosh that he can open the jump gate, but
Cranston protests, saying that he wants the ship scanned.  Sheridan tells
him that it is an ambassadorial vessel, but Cranston isn't satisfied.
Sheridan reluctantly agrees to scan the ship, and the scan find one life
form, but it isn't human.  Sheridan offers sarcastically to return the
ship to the station to search it thoroughly, but warns Cranston that, if
they find nothing, it could cause a major diplomatic incident.  Cranston
gives his permission for the ship to enter the jumpgate, which it does.
Sheridan orders Ivanova to help Cranston find out where Dr. Jacobs really
went, and help him in any way possible.  He also tells Cranston that, as
soon as Ivanova is finished, he hopes Cranston will leave.  Cranston says
nothing, but leaves C&C.

<p>
<img align=middle width=128 height=96
src="/lurk/gif/035/cooperate.gif"> "Give him your <em>full</em> cooperation."

<p>
Sheridan, Ivanova, Garibaldi, and Franklin arrive in bay 13, where the
Vorlon ship has redocked.  Sheridan tells them that they are supposed to
wait until the ship recognizes them, which it soon does.  Sheridan
explains that it knows them because it is alive.  Kosh wasn't on the ship when
they scanned it from C&C, and since the scan only registered one life form,
it must be the ship.  The ship opens up, and tentacle-like protusions
extract a large pod from it.  When the pod touches the ground, it opens
to reveal Dr. Jacobs inside.  Dr. Franklin quickly revives him from an
artificial coma, which Kosh insisted on as a condition for the use of the
ship.  Dr. Jacobs revives.  "While I was asleep," he says, "the uh...the
ship...It sang to me."

<p>
<img align=middle width=128 height=96
src="/lurk/gif/035/tentacles.gif"> The ship gives Dr. Jacobs back.

<p>
Sheridan returns to the woman sent by General Hague and hands her a data
crystal, which he says contains all of Dr. Jacobs' information.  She
accepts it willingly.  "Good.  It's not enough to go public with yet, but
it's a start.  We'll get Jacobs onto one of our ships as soon as
possible.  Thank you again for your help.  You've just scored a major
victory for the good guys.  You should be proud.  Until next time, Captain."

<p>
"There's always a next time, isn't there?" Captain Sheridan asks.

<p>
"You'd better pray it stays that way, Captain.  Because as long as there
is a next time, at least there's a chance we'll win."  She turns to
leave, but offers him one final thought before she goes.  "Because in this
war, Captain, we need all the chances we can get."
