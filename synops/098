<h3>Synopsis by Arturo Magidin (magidin@math.berkeley.edu)</h3>

<P>

Byron's telepaths are dug in in Brown Sector, and threatening a hunger
strike until their demands for a homeworld are met (<a
href="../guide/097.html">"In the Kingdom of the Blind"</a>). Sheridan cannot
intervene, since his hands are full with the attacks on the Alliance
ships, and the alien ambassadors blaming each other. So Lochley sends
a message to Bester, asking for help.

<P>

The telepaths are using telepathic suggestions to slow down security,
which is trying to burn through to where the telepaths are. When
Lochley comes down to investigate, Zack tells her about the air
ducts. They are too small and fragile to send a security team, but one
person could make it through. Lochley wants to go in: a telepathic
suggestion from Byron.

<P>

Meanwhile, on Centauri Prime, G'Kar is eating some fresh spoo and
Londo is reading some reports. The reports indicate a 15% increase in
production of war materials, which doesn't make sense for peace time,
and is in fact contrary to standard Centauri procedure. G'Kar is
unconcerned, and offers Londo some of the spoo. But Londo refuses,
saying that only a Narn can tolerate fresh spoo. G'Kar is suddenly
interested: the spoo was going to the south wing of the palace, and
was not meant for him. Who was it meant for? Londo reveals that there
are some cells in that area of the palace, and G'Kar demands to be
taken there.

In a dark cell, they find a Narn chained to the wall: G'Kar's aide,
Na'Toth. At first, Na'Toth thinks G'Kar is also a prisoner, but G'Kar
explains that the war is over. Na'Toth then recounts her experiences:
she was on the Narn Homeworld when the Centauri bombed it with
asteroids (<a href="../guide/042.html">"The Long, Twilight
Struggle"</a>, <a href="../guide/064.html">"And the Rock Cried Out, No
Hiding Place"</a>). She was later taken captive by the Centauri and
taken to the Royal Palace as entertainment, a task for which she
proved unsuitable. As punishment, Cartagia ordered her put in the cell
two years ago.

<P>

G'Kar demands to know why she is still a prisoner. "I have no idea,"
replies Londo; "she was probably just forgotten." Having received a
royal order that was never countermanded, the guards have kept her
prisoner there. And Londo, even though he is the Prime Minister,
cannot order her release: that would be countermanding a royal order,
which is treason and punishable by death. Only the Regent can order
her released, and they cannot count on his help. Londo cannot do
anything until he is Emperor. But G'Kar points out Na'Toth may not
survive that long. "There is nothing I can do," says Londo. "There
<i>is</i> something you can do," says G'Kar angrily; "you will find
it, and you will do it! One way or another, we are leaving here with
Na'Toth."

On Babylon 5, Lochley gets ready to go in through the air
ducts.

<P>

In Sheridan's office, Garibaldi explains that in his opinion, the
problem is not Byron, but rather the telepaths that got out before
Byron sealed himself in. He is worried about sabotage. Garibaldi also
has another piece of information: the Drazi found debris from a
Brakiri ship where the latest attack on their ships occured. They plan
to introduce it as evidence on the next council meeting.

<P>

Lochley finally makes it through to where the telepaths are, and is
taken to see Byron. Lochley explains that everyone in the Alliance was
tense because of the attacks on their ships, and wanted someone to
lash at; Byron's threats gave them a target. "Any chance you may have
had of getting a homeworld for your people," Lochley adds, "is pretty
much shot to hell." She tells him that they have to give up and give
up now, otherwise people are going to die when they come to
them. Byron regrets the deaths that are coming, but again refuses to
leave.

<P>

As a final plea, Lochley asks him for help in identifying the
telepaths who are outside and are a threat. But despite Byron's
disagreements with them, he will not turn them in. "We don't betray
our own kind," Byron explains.

<P>

Lochley offers to take anyone out with her, but no one wants to
leave. Lochley is now confused. "Why did you let me come here?" she
asks Byron, and adds "Why did you agree to see me?"

<P>

"To say goodbye," answers Byron. He adds "While you have not gone out
of your way to be kind to us, you have been fair, and that requires
comment. Especially since I have a feeling this will be the last time
we will see one another." He shakes Lochley's hand, and Lochley turns
around and leaves the way she came.

<P>

Londo is in his quarters when G'Kar comes in. G'Kar has arranged for a
Narn ship to meet them halfway to Babylon 5 to take Na'Toth home to
Narn. Despite this arrangements, Londo still does not know how they
will get her out of the palace. A Centauri woman enters to inform him
that a cruiser bound for Babylon 5 will depart that night. Londo is
struck by an idea, and asks the woman for a loan of her clothes, a
request with which she complies.

In a closed session of the Interstellar Alliance Council, the Drazi
ambassador accuses the Brakiri of working with the telepaths and
attacking their ships. The Brakiri are outraged and deny the
charge. The Drazi have dispatched warships to their border with the
Brakiri: for every Drazi ship destroyed, the Drazi will destroy a
Brakiri ship.

<P>

The Gaim ambassador also has an announcement, however. The Gaim have
found debris as well, but it is from Drazi ships, not Brakiri. The
Brakiri now accuse the Drazi of orchestrating it all.

<P>

Sheridan disagrees. He points out that it must be a trick by someone
else. Furthermore, Garibaldi has analyzed the
debris and concluded the pieces were not shot off, but rather were cut
off and left behind. "They planted them," says Sheridan, "where they
knew you would find them, hoping for exactly this reaction." But
Sheridan still doesn't know who is behind it all. He asks the
ambassadors to work together to find out, or at least to give Sheridan
more time to figure out who is behind the attacks.

<P>

But the Drazi are through waiting: "Any ship that crosses into Drazi
space without proper authorization," warns the Drazi Ambassador, "will
not survive the mistake!" He leaves the meeting, and the other
ambassadors follow him.

<P>

In Centauri Prime, Londo enters Na'Toth's cell. After ascertaining she
is the only prisoner left, he orders the guard never to come back and
not to let anyone else go there. He implies Na'Toth will be dead soon,
and as a final order, tells the guard to wait three days and then wall
up the hallway. The guard obeys and leaves.

<P>

"Have you come to kill me, Mollari?" asks Na'Toth in a weary
voice. "No," replies Londo. "I will kill you," says Na'Toth, softly,
"at the very first opportunity." "Yes," replies Londo, "I suspect
you'll have to get in line for that honor." He unchains her as G'Kar
comes in with the clothes Londo borrowed.
<br clear=all>

<P>

<img align=right width=160 height=120 alt="" src="/lurk/gif/098/atot15.jpeg">
Londo's plan is simple: with Na'Toth dressed and veiled as a Centauri
woman, they will simply walk to their ship. The Royal Court has been
trained to turn a blind eye to inappropriate behavior, so Londo walks
hand in hand with Na'Toth, pretending to be drunk and being quite loud
in his promises of future delights and adventures. As he predicted,
everyone they meet turns away and pretends not to notice, and they
make their ship safely.

<P>

On Babylon 5, Bester arrives. "I told you they were trouble," he
reminds the Captain smugly, "but you wouldn't listen. That's all
right, I'm used to it. I'm here now. It's all going to be just fine."

<P>

The telepaths who left Byron have found out that Bester is back, and
realize the Bloodhounds cannot be far behind. Since they cannot count
on help from Lochley, and they will not let themselves be taken back
to the Psi Corps, they decide to fight back. They attack some security
guards, and telepathically get the code for the weapons locker from
one of them.

<img align=right width=160 height=120 alt="" src="/lurk/gif/098/atot17.jpeg">
Bester arrives with Lochley to where security is still trying to cut
through, and helps block the telepaths inside, thus allowing the
welder to cut through the doors without being slowed down. Lochley
promises Bester that if he can get the telepaths out safely, he may
take custody of them.
<br clear=all>

<P>

<img align=right width=160 height=120 alt="" src="/lurk/gif/098/atot20.jpeg">
Just before they cut through, the armed telepaths open fire and kill
the welder and a security guard before withdrawing.

<img align=right width=160 height=120 alt="" src="/lurk/gif/098/atot23.jpeg">
Inside, Byron is distraught at the knowledge that his people are
killing in his name. "I've got to stop it," Byron tells Lyta. "There's
nothing you can do," she replies. "Yes," counter Byron, "yes there
is."
<br clear=all>

<P>

<img align=right width=160 height=120 alt="" src="/lurk/gif/098/atot25.jpeg">
Sheridan and Delenn invite the Drazi, Gaim and Brakiri ambassadors to
a private meeting. They tell the Drazi that White Stars are now
watching their ships massed on the border, and will intervene if they
attack any Brakiri ships. According to the terms of the Alliance, no
member race may attack any other member race. The same threat of
retaliation applies to the Gaim and the Brakiri. The three Ambassadors
are outraged, and consider this an attack on the sovereign rights. But
they cannot stand up to the White Stars. Sheridan asks for more time
to gather evidence, and the three reluctantly agree.

<P>

"We will wait for a little while," the Drazi Ambassador says, and then
he warns: "But we will not forget this. You threatened to use force
against us when all we wanted was to protect ourselves. Every great
fall begins with a single mistake. This was yours."

En route to Babylon 5, Na'Toth is taken to a Narn transport. It will
be difficult for her to heal, especially her spirit, but G'Kar is
confident she will make a full recovery, given time.  Londo admits to
G'Kar that saving was Na'Toth was a very exhilarating experience for
him, and he enjoyed it immensely.

<P>

And on Babylon 5, Bester welcomes some of his associates to the
station: the Bloodhounds have arrived, and the storm is about to
begin.
