At C&C, Ivanova delivers a message to Sheridan from Captain Maynard of
the Cortez.  The Cortez is coming to Babylon 5 to pick up supplies.
Ivanova notices that they are asking for a lot of supplies, and
Sheridan explains that it is because they have been travelling for five
years.  The Cortez is an Explorer ship, a rare sight for most people
since such ships are nearly always out mapping the edges of known space.
Sheridan is informed
that the ship is coming through the jumpgate, and everyone is amazed by
it; it's nearly as long as Babylon 5 itself.  Sheridan tells
everyone at C&C to take a good look.

<p>
Sheridan and Captain Jack Maynard of the Cortez spend some time getting
reacquainted.  Maynard talks about some of the mapping he did on the
rim, and says that he returned to fix one of the Euphrates jump gates
and to resupply.

<p>
Delenn approaches them, and Sheridan introduces the
two.  Delenn makes a request to convene the council to discuss the
problems in sector 19, and Sheridan agrees to do so.  Maynard is
confused about Delenn's apperance, not understanding how a Minbari can
look so unusual.

<p>
"There's the story she told us," Sheridan explains, "but
then the Minbari never tell you the whole truth."

<p>
Maynard agrees.
They talk about Babylon 5, and Sheridan talks about how busy the job is
keeping him.  Maynard says that he never thought Sheridan would accept
such an assignment.

<p>
Garibaldi is in MedLab, being examined by Dr. Franklin.  Garibaldi says
that he appreciates Franklin's help, but eats whatever he wants
whenever he wants, and as much as he chooses.  Dr. Franklin says that
Garibaldi can no longer do that, as he is iron-deficient and has high
blood pressure.  Dr. Franklin says that, to remedy the situation,
Garibaldi needs to be put on a restricted diet.  Garibaldi objects,
saying that it is almost time for him to make Bagna Cauda, an Italian
fondue that contains olive oil, garlic, butter, anchovies, and other
ingredients, but Franklin says he shouldn't have it, and that he should stay
away from salt and bread especially.  Garibaldi says that, without
those things, he can't make Bagna Cauda.  Dr. Franklin still won't
allow Garibaldi to eat it, and gives him a list of other things he
shouldn't eat.  Garibaldi looks at the list and is angered that most of
his favorite foods are there.

<p>
<img align=middle width=128 height=96

<p>
Dr. Franklin says that he is serious and that this gives him
the opportunity to call in the ranking officers for a nutritional
profile, as they probably all have poor eating habits.

<p>
Sheridan tells Maynard about his first day on Babylon 5, regarding the
Narns and Centauri, the Vorlons, the Minbari's feelings toward him, and
Delenn's chrysalis.  Sheridan says he is handling things one day at a
time.  Maynard says that he never imagined Sheridan would be on the
station.  He wonders why the President would choose someone the Minbari
didn't like.  He also wonders how Sheridan is doing, since this job was
not what he was trained for.  Sheridan says that he can make a
difference on Babylon 5, and that doing that is important.  Maynard doesn't
understand how Sheridan could be satisfied with a desk job, but
Sheridan says, "Well, it's a hell of a desk to be tied to."

<p>
Garibaldi reports to Sheridan about a recent wave of shoplifting cases.
Sheridan is upset that Garibaldi
would come to him with such a minor problem.  He says that he is sure
Garibaldi can handle the problem, and expects a full report as soon as
the guilty parties are apprehended.  Garibaldi thought that Sheridan
wanted to know everything that happened on the station.  Sheridan says
he wants to know everything important that happens, but wants Garibaldi
to take care of the details.

<p>
Sheridan, Ivanova, Warren Keffer, and the leader of Zeta Squadron are
in the officer's lounge, listening to some of Captain Maynard's stories
about the rim.  Maynard says he wants to hear their stories, but the
others say that his stories are more interesting.  Keffer asks Maynard
where he is headed next, and Maynard says that he is going back to the
rim to build jump gates so the area can be explored.  Ivanova asks
about Maynard's experiences in hyperspace, but Maynard is unsure what
she means.  Keffer tells Maynard about the Universe Today article a few
months earlier asking if something was living in hyperspace.  Maynard
isn't sure about the answer to that, but does say that he has seen
something out there, and that it is "stranger than any one of us can
imagine."

<p>
Sheridan escorts Maynard back to his quarters, and asks if his comments
about hyperspace were true, or if he made it up.  Maynard says that
they were true.  "Well," he continues, "it wasn't in hyperspace,
though.  But you know, things can get kind of weird out on the rim,
too.  It's funny.  You never know what you're going to find when you
look over the edge of what's known and into what's not.  We were in
sector 857.  I took my nav officer, Lietuenant Patrick, with me for a
look around in one of our scout ships.  Well, I noticed that we'd
gotten out of sight of the Cortez, and I was, I was just about ready to
turn back when I saw something.  It was maybe a thousand kilometers
away--black against space.  Now, the reason that I knew it was there is
that it blotted out the stars behind it.  I don't know the exact shape
of it, but...it was big.  I turned to Pat, to ask him if he could see
it, and when I looked back, it had vanished."

<p>
Sheridan tells Maynard
that he is the second person in a month to tell him that something
strange is happening out on the rim.  He asks if Lieutenant
Patrick saw anything.  Maynard says he only saw a blink--a change in
space.  "He doesn't know what it was any more than I do," Maynard
continues.  "But it's there.  And it was real.  It still sends a shiver
up my back when I think about it."

<p>
Garibaldi is talking with a young man named Orwell.  Orwell tells
Garibaldi that it will be very difficult to obtain the items he wants.
Garibaldi says he can pay for it, but Orwell thinks it will be
difficult to obtain because Garibaldi won't accept substitutes, and it
is extremely difficult to find the items.  Garibaldi offers a bonus and
tells Orwell not to
mention anything about it to Dr. Franklin.

<p>
<img align=middle width=128 height=96

couldn't afford it."

<p>
Meanwhile, Sheridan is in
MedLab, talking to Dr. Franklin, who says that Sheridan should lose ten
pounds, and should avoid meat, fat, and should eat lots of vegetables.

<p>
"I'm not sure I understand the intent of this meeting, Teronn," Delenn
tells the Minbari who is speaking with her.

<p>
He explains that the other
Minbari on the station are afraid that Delenn is no longer one of
them.

<p>
"I am more 'one of us' at this moment, than I have ever been.
More than you will ever know," she tells him.  She says that she
appreciates the concern, but says she can't tell him anything else.

<p>
He tells her that they need to understand what has happened.

<p>
"Understanding is not required.  Only obedience."

<p>
<img align=middle width=128 height=96
src="/lurk/gif/026/delenn.gif">

<p>
Teronn says that
they would be obedient if they could be assured that she was still one
of their own kind.  He says they have the right to know if she is.  "If
you can not give us what we need," he continues. we will ask permission
to send a representative to speak directly with the Grey
Council...unless you object." She does not object.  Teronn leaves.

<p>
Dr. Franklin tells Ivanova that she too needs to go on an increased
diet in order to replenish deficiences in calcium, iron, and other
minerals that are hampering the healing of her leg.  He hands her a
food plan, and after looking at it, she protests that she will gain
weight.  As she leaves angrily, she says, "Figures.  All my life, I've
fought against imperialism.  Now, suddenly, I AM the expanding Russian
frontier."  As she leaves, Dr. Franklin adds, "But with very nice
borders."

<p>
Sheridan escorts Maynard to the Cortez.  Sheridan tells Maynard that he
wishes he were going along.  Maynard says he understands Sheridan's
feelings, but does regard his job as just a job.  He says that
interesting things don't happen very often, but Sheridan doesn't
agree.  "The adventure is out there, Jack.  A man has to go meet it."

<p>
Maynard says that sometimes, you don't need to find it, because it will
find you.  Captain Maynard is then called to the Cortez.  He and
Sheridan say their goodbyes and leave.  Sheridan goes to C&C, where he
gives the final departure clearance to the Cortez.  He watches it enter
the jumpgate and disappear.

<p>
Later, Ivanova is in Sheridan's office, talking to him about problems
she is having with two of the delegations on board.  He tells her that
such problems should be her concern, but she informs him that they will
not accept a solution from anyone but him.  Sheridan reluctantly agrees
to help solve the delgations' problems, but Ivanova is not completely
satisfied.  She tells him that she feels he has been acting strangely
ever since the Cortez arrived.  She asks him if he wants to talk about
it.

<p>
"I command starships, Susan," he explains to her, "not cities in
space.  These problems, the...the petty complaints, the endless
bickering, the constant negotiations.  Jack Maynard said this isn't
what I was trained for, and he's right.  I mean, I am constantly
sandbagged, swamped, drowned, and snowed under by nothing but trivia.
I mean, look at this desk.  I can't find a thing on it.  You know me.
Is this me?  Huh?"

<p>
She tries to tell him that command a starship and
commanding Babylon 5 are two different challenges, but that one is not
more difficult than the other.  She doesn't accept this as an answer
because he never had difficulty with problems such as these on a
starship.

<p>
He says that Captain Maynard was right.  "They have turned
me into a bureaucrat, a politician."

<p>
Ivanova asks him if he believes
President Clark was wrong in assigning him to the post.

<p>
"I don't
know," Sheridan answers.  "Maybe he was, and it's just taken this long
to sink in."

<p>
The Cortez is in hyperspace when an explosion rocks the ship.
After they completed the jump, their fusion reactor spiked, dropping
power to 30%, and causing the ship's tracking system to malfunction.
This caused them to lose their lock to the jump point and rendered them
incapable of leaving hyperspace.  Though they are flying blind, they
continue to move through hyperspace, hoping to eventually locate a jump
point through which they can exit.

<p>
Ivanova, Garibaldi, and Sheridan are sitting at a table together,
eating dinner.  They eye the plates before them with great distate, not
seeing the types of food they would normally eat.  Garibaldi explains
that he was able to solve the problems with the shoplifters.  Sheridan
tries to eat some
of his salad, but can't.  He points at Garibaldi and accuses him of
being at fault for the food plan.  Garibaldi tries to absolve himself
of blame, but the three find a better solution: Ivanova gives her food
to Garibaldi, who gives his to Sheridan, and Sheridan gives his to
Ivanova.  They are all about to eat the meals they would prefer when
Dr. Franklin walks by and catches them.  They all quickly switch plates
around again and begin eating their proper meals.

<p>
<img align=middle width=128 height=96

<p>
The Cortez is still flying blind, and while power has returned, they do
not have the time necessary to fix the navigational systems of the
ship, as it would take them 48 hours, by which time they would no
longer be able to locate the jump gate's signal.  Captain Maynard
orders their communications officer to send a mayday.  Though the
officer doesn't believe it could travel far enough in hyperspace to be
of any use, they send it anyway.  Babylon 5 receives the mayday, and
Sheridan responds to it, saying that help is on the way.  He orders all
available pilots to their squadron bays.  Ivanova reminds Sheridan that
no ship has ever escaped from hyperspace in such a situation.  Sheridan
knows that, but rushes off to prepare anyway.

<p>
Dr. Franklin is examining Delenn in MedLab.  She objects to being
examined so much, but he says that, in addition to curiosity, he has a
responsibility to make sure she is healthy after her change.  She says
that she is, and has suffered only minor problems, such as dizziness and
fatigue.  He asks if anything else is bothering her, and she says no.
He also asks if the other Minbari are accepting the change without
question.

<p>
"Of course," Delenn says.  Changing the
subject, she asks Dr. Franklin about a new delegation coming to the
station.  Dr. Franklin doesn't understand, but Delenn explains that
Garibaldi was waiting for them.  "I believe," she tells him, "they're
called Bagna Cauda?"

<p>
Sheridan and Ivanova are in the squadron bays, addressing the pilots
who will go out to attempt to rescue the Cortez.  Sheridan says that
they must try, even though no ship has been found when lost before.
They don't know where the ship is, but they do know that, while the
first mayday sent by the Cortez was strong, they are fading now.

<p>
Galus, the leader of Zeta squadron, asks how they can find the ship if
they do not even know how to begin looking.

<p>
Sheridan says that he has
an idea, although it is a risky one.  "The first fighter will stop just
inside the gate, and lock onto the gate's signal," Sheridan explains.
"The second fighter will proceed 1000 kilometers further in, and lock
onto the signal of the first one.  The third fighter will lock onto the
signal of the second one, and so on."  He also says that they could
increase the range, if necessary, by moving subsequent fighters further
out.  While it is a dangerous mission, all the pilots understand and
prepare to leave, though both Sheridan and Ivanova wish they were
going with them.

<p>
Sheridan addresses all fighters as they prepare to leave on the
mission.  "An old friend of mine once quoted me a ancient Egyptian
blessing: `God be between you and harm, and all the empty places we
must walk.'  Bring the Cortez home."  The fighters then leave the
station and enter the jumpgate, to search for the Cortez.

<p>
There is no longer a signal from the Cortez, but the fighters are
positioned inside the jumpgate, relaying the message to each other, and
broadcasting it in hopes that the Cortez will receive it, though there
hasn't been a response yet.  Soon, the Cortez does receive the signal
from Babylon 5, and responds, saying that their lock-on
still isn't functioning.  Sheridan orders the Cortez to continue
broadcasting their mayday so that a fighter can find them and
lead them out of hyperspace.  The fighters chosen for this are Galus
and Keffer.  They have difficulty locating the Cortez, because the radio
locator "doesn't want to settle."  Eventually, the fighters move out so
far that they lose contact with Babylon 5.

<p>
Ivanova and Sheridan are both in C&C, anxiously awaiting any
information about the Cortez, but they hear nothing.  Sheridan asks
Ivanova to take a break, but she doesn't want to any more than he
does.  Sheridan says that Maynard is too good a friend to leave his
post.  "If this turns into a wake," he says to Ivanova, "I want to be
here."  Sheridan explains that Maynard was his first commanding officer;
Sheridan worshipped him.  Ivanova understands his feelings, and
says that she will be there for him if the Cortez does not make it
back, but asks him to remember the Egyptian blessing, given him by
Maynard, in the meantime.

<p>
Keffer locates the mayday from the Cortez, and radios Galus, telling
him so.  Galus tells Keffer to go, saying that he will maintain
position while Keffer finds the Cortez.  Keffer soon finds the Cortez,
and approaches it.  Keffer loses contact with Galus when a Shadow ship
appears in hyperspace and collides with Galus' ship, destroying it.
On its way, the Shadow ship also collides with Keffer's ship, though
luckily it only sends it spinning away, stabilizers offline.

<p>
Maynard and the Cortez
manage to locate Keffer's ship, but notice only that he repeatedly
fires in the same direction as his ship spins.  Captain Maynard determines
that this must
mean Keffer wants him to go in the direction of the fire.  They begin
to lay in the course when they regain contact with Keffer's Starfury.
They offer to come and retrieve him, but Keffer says that both vessels
will be lost if they waste time picking him up.
Maynard understands, and orders the Cortez
to be taken back to Babylon 5.

<p>
Sheridan, Ivanova, and the others
are relieved at the safe return of the Cortez and most of the
Starfuries, though saddened that two fighters did not make it back.

<p>
Orwell is waiting impatiently for Garibaldi, who soon arrives.  Orwell
explains that he had difficult obtaining the items Garibaldi wanted,
but did manage to do so, and opens a case for Garibaldi's inspection.
Garibaldi begins examining the contents when he is interrupted by
Dr. Franklin, who realized that Orwell had the ability to gather the
ingredients for Bagna Cauda so far away from Earth.  Orwell leaves, and
Garibaldi says that he wants Bagna Cauda for his birthday.  Dr.
Franklin doesn't accept this as an excuse until Garibaldi
explains further.  "My father always made Bagna Cauda for me on my
birthday.  Pop was a great cook, and Bagna was his speciality.  When he
used to cook it, I mean, the smell, oh man, the smell would fill the
whole place.  It's funny, you know.  When I watched him cook, I knew he
was doing it because he loved me.  He just could never say it, so he
did that instead.  He's been gone a long time.  So, now, I make it
myself once a year, honoring him, you know.  It's...it's the only part
of him I got left."  Franklin believes the story, and tells Garibaldi
to make enough for two people.

<p>
Sheridan is in the arboretum when Delenn comes in.  She expresses her
sympathy over the loss of the two Starfuries.  Sheridan says that the
hardest part of command is sending others out to die.  She tries to
tell him that because he did so, they managed to save others; he was
in the right place.

<p>
<img align=middle width=128 height=96

<p>
He asks
what makes her think that he belongs on Babylon 5, and she answers.
"The universe puts us in places where we can learn.  They are never
easy places.  They are right.  Wherever we are is the right place at
the right time.  Pain sometimes comes.  It is part of the process of
constantly being born."

<p>
Sheridan says he thinks she's been doing thinking
about this on her own.

<p>
"Perhaps," she tells him.  "We are both, I
suppose, going through transitions.  But the universe knows what it's
doing."

<p>
Sheridan says that he wishes he had the faith in the universe
that she did.

<p>
"Then I will tell you a great secret, Captain," Delenn
says to him.  Perhaps the greatest of all time.  The molecules of your
body are the same molecules that make up this station, and the nebula
outside, that burn inside the stars themselves.  We are starstuff, we
are the universe, made manifest, trying to figure itself out.  As we
have both learned, sometimes the universe requires a change of
perspective."

<p>
Keffer is still lost in hyperspace, and running out of air, though he
finally gets his thrusters back on-line.  He cannot, however, locate
the jumpgate because his lock-on systems are not functioning.
Suddenly, another Shadow ship appears, flies a brief distance, and
vanishes.  Keffer tells the computer to analyze its flight path and
tells it to correlate with the last sighting.

<p>

<p>
Sheridan is about to
give up on Keffer's return when the jumpgate activates, and Keffer
comes through it, requesting permission to dock.  Sheridan happily
agrees.

<p>
Keffer proposes a toast to Commander Galus.  Ivanova asks Keffer if he
could determine anything about the object that hit him, and indirectly,
saved him.  He says he couldn't tell anything about it, but that
because he knew its position when it first appeared relative to his
position, he was able to find his way out, using its origination point
the second time as a reference.  But he didn't know what it was.  "There
was just this feeling that something dark and dangerous had gone by,"
he explains.

<p>
Maynard agrees that the feeling is powerful.  Keffer
wants to learn what the object was, but Ivanova says there are more
important
matters to attend to.  She promotes Keffer to the leader of Zeta
Squadron.

<p>
Garibaldi and Dr. Franklin are in Garibaldi's quarters, preparing to
eat the Bagna Cauda.  Though Franklin initially objects, once he tastes
it, he admits that he likes it very much.  Garibaldi offers him
dessert.  Franklin says he didn't authorize dessert, but Garibaldi
doesn't care -- he simply chooses not to give any to Franklin, who then
objects to that, but soon loses his cares in the Bagna Cauda.

Ivanova enters Sheridan's office where Sheridan is hard at work.
Ivanova tells Sheridan that the others would like to see him in the
officer's club.  Sheridan says that he has much work to do, but will
try to catch up to them in an hour or so.  He asks Ivanova if she has ever
had a long talk with Ambassador Delenn.

<p>
"From time to time."

<p>
"She and the universe seem to have a special relationship."

have said.  "Starstuff," he says, smiling.
