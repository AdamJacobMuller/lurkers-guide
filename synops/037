We interrupt your evening schedule to bring you the following special program.
September 16, 2259.  The Interstellar Network News presents "36 Hours on
Babylon 5" with your host, Cynthia Torqueman, reporting live from the ISN News
Center, in Geneva.

Good evening, I'm Cynthia Torqueman.  In the hundred or so years since
humanity went to the stars, we've established outposts and colonies on over
two dozen worlds in fourteen solar systems.  Out of all those far-flung
outposts, only the Mars Colony, plagued by scattered groups of separatists,
who have used acts of terror to intimidate the Earth-loyal majority, has
proven more controversial than the Earth Alliance station, Babylon 5.  Located
in a sector of space near Epsilon Iridani, designated neutral territory,
Babylon 5 has defied the odds and continued to operate as a free port, a
center for diplomacy, and a showpiece for the Earth Alliance Resources and
Technologies division.  From its highly publicized debut three years ago,
recent polls indicate a growing dissatisfaction with the time, money, and
effort consumed by this space-borne community.  So, tonight, we take you to
the center of the controversy.  An ISN crew and I recently spent 36 hours
aboard Babylon 5, asking hard questions and, on occasion, get in a little over
our heads.  In the process of putting this report together, it didn't take us
long to learn the most important rule of survival aboard Babylon 5: expect the
unexpected.

Thirty minutes ago, a Narn vessel opened fire on a Centauri transport without
warning or explanation.  The bodies of the dead and wounded are being brought
to this central docking area for transfer to various MedLab facilities on
Babylon 5, which are already working beyond maximum capacity.  Behind me is
Dr. Stephen Franklin, Chief of Staff.  Doctor?  Doctor Franklin?

<p>
<dt>
Franklin (to medical assistants)
<dd>
...for immediate surgery and full CAT scan.  I need more regent packs over
here, people.

<p>
<dt>
Torqueman
<dd>
Dr. Franklin, Cynthia Torqueman, ISN news.  What happened here?

<p>
<dt>
Franklin
<dd>
I don't know.  Somebody said something about an ambush.  (to assistants)
All right, keep his head elevated thirty degrees minimum or he'll choke on his
own blood.

<p>
<dt>
Torqueman
<dd>
Can you say what the reason was...

<p>
<dt>
Franklin
<dd>
I'm sorry...

<p>
<dt>
Torqueman
<dd>
Captain Sheridan!  Cynthia Torqueman, ISN news.  Do you have any comment on
what just happened here?

<p>
<dt>
Sheridan
<dd>
No, no comment at this time.  (to Franklin) Doctor...

<p>
<dt>
Torqueman
<dd>
What about the Narn vessel that attacked the transport.

<p>
<dt>
Sheridan
<dd>
We dispatched a fighter wing to apprehend them.  We won't know anything more
until they're in protective custody.  If you will excuse me please.

<p>
<dt>
<b>Ambassador Londo Mollari, Centauri Republic</b>
<dd>
This is exactly the kind of behavior that endangers the very purpose of
Babylon 5.  This place is dedicated to finding peaceful solutions to our
problems.  For the Narn to carry their vendetta against our people into
neutral territory like this is reckless and irresponsible.  And though we
mourn our own losses, we have felt strongly about our friends from Earth, ever
since we first encountered your world a hundred years ago.  To endanger your
people for no reason...

<p>
<dt>
Torqueman
<dd>
Then the attack on your transport was completely unprovoked?

<p>
<dt>
Ambassador Mollari
<dd>
Of course.

<p>
<dt>
<b>Ambassador G'kar, Narn Regime</b>
<dd>
He's lying.

<p>
<dt>
Torqueman
<dd>
Then can you tell us why your ship opened fire on the Centauri transport?

<p>
<dt>
G'kar
<dd>
I'll issue a statement after I have consulted with my government.

<p>
<dt>
Torqueman
<dd>
Are you saying your government sanctioned this attack?

<p>
<dt>
G'kar
<dd>
No.

<p>
<dt>
Torqueman
<dd>
Do you think attacks of this nature put everybody aboard Babylon 5 in
unnecessary jeopardy?

<p>
<dt>
G'kar
<dd>
We are already in far greater jeopardy than you can possibly imagine.

For all the apparent danger in this part of space, it seems to have had little
effect on travel.  Nearly a quarter of a million humans and aliens are here at
any given moment.  While most are in transit to distant worlds, many others
actually live and work here.  What does it take to call a place like this
home?

<b>Eduardo Delvientos. Dock Supervisor. Guild dockworkers on B5: 1500.</b>
<dd>
Well, it's a...it's a job.  I've been in a lot worse places, let me tell you.
It gets crazy around here sometimes, you got fifty, sixty ships a day coming
through here, loading and unloading, and every last one of them is a priority
job, at least that's what they tell us.  (to a worker)  Hey, watch those
crates over there.  Get 'em over to the side.  No, no, the other side.  (to
Torqueman)  We had a couple of problems here last year, try to hit us with
some budget cuts.  You know, same old song.  But that's the past.  You gotta
go along to get along, you know what I mean?

<p>

And you've never felt that your safety has been compromised?

<p>

No ma'am.

<b>Captain John J. Sheridan.  Recipient, Earthforce Silver Star for Valor in
        Minbari War.</b>
<dd>
I guess it's the old joke, "You don't have to be crazy to work here, but it
helps."  I suppose there is a...certain attraction to being out here on the
edge like this.  A new frontier...

<p>
<dt>
Torqueman
<dd>
New frontier is right.  When Babylon 5 went online in 2257, oddsmakers from
New Vegas to Lloyds of London were predicting it wouldn't last six months.

<p>
<dt>
Sheridan
<dd>
Hmm.  Well, I've never been very much on gambling.  Never quite found the time
for it.

<p>
<dt>
Torqueman
<dd>
You were originally a starship captain, correct?

<p>
<dt>
Sheridan
<dd>
Yeah.  The Agamemnon.  She was a real beauty.  One of the first Omega class
destroyers to come off the assembly line after the war.  Our job was part
military patrol, part diplomatic mission.  We went around to most of the Non-
Aligned Worlds, put in an appearance, kept the peace, that sort of thing.

<p>
<dt>
Torqueman
<dd>
Babylon 5 has been through some dramatic changes in administration since it
became operational.  Would you attribute these changes to...bad management,
or, to quote former Senator Hidoshi, "Is this horse just to big for anybody to
ride?"

<p>
<dt>
Sheridan
<dd>
Changes are part of the military life.  Everybody goes into this knowing that
tomorrow you could be someplace you hadn't even heard of 24 hours ago.  I've
been stationed so many places over the years I can't even remember most of
them.  But you're right.  Some days this is one hell of a big horse.

You know what the folks back home don't understand, the ones who've never
left Earth, is just how dangerous space can be.  Aside from incidents like
this, just the everyday reality of living your days and nights in a big tin
can surrounded by a vacuum.  I remember my first time on a transport, on the
Moon-Mars run.  I was just a kid, maybe seventeen.  A buddy of mine was
messing around, and zipping through the halls, and he hid in one of the
airlocks.  I don't know, I guess he was gonna try to scare us or something, I
don't know...But just as I got close, he must have hit the wrong button
because the air doors slammed shut, the space doors opened, and he just flew
out into space.  You know, the one thing they never tell you is that you don't
die instantly in vacuum.  Just hung there, against the black, like a puppet
with his strings all tangled up.  Or one of those old cartoons where you run
off the edge of a cliff and your legs keep going.  You could see that he was
trying to breathe, but there was nothing.  The one thing I remember, when they
pulled in his body, his eyes were frozen.  A lot of people make jokes about
spacing somebody, about shoving somebody out an airlock.  I don't think it's
funny.  Never will.


<p clear=all>
<dt>
<hr>

<p>
<dt>
Torqueman
<dd>
Although the airlocks on Babylon 5 are considerably safer, the last three
years have shown that the station itself is anything but secure.  In its
first year of operation, there were half a dozen murders, three acts of
sabotage including a bomb that blew out two levels, and a barely averted
attack by the Vorlon Empire.  Since then, there have been fifty deaths by
violence.  So the question remains, given its cost in lives and money, is
Babylon 5 serving any useful purpose, or, as we're about to see, is the whole
thing falling apart at the seams?

<p>
<dt>
<hr>

<p>
<dt>
G'kar
<dd>
I've just been briefed by my government, and I'm prepared to issue the
following statement.  The Centauri ship that was attacked by one of our
vessels was not simply a commercial transport.  It was secretly transferring
weapons of mass destruction to ships bound for the front lines where they were
to be used in the war against our people.  They have turned Babylon 5 into a
weapons supply post, and we cannot allow this to continue, even if it means
shutting down Babylon 5 completely.

"36 Hours on Babylon 5" continues with Cynthia Torqueman.

Torqueman (at anchor desk)
<dd>
According to figures released by the newly-formed office of public morale,
President William Clark has risen to dramatic new levels of popularity,
because of his administration's emphasis on addressing the needs of Earth.  As
a result, recent hearings in Earthdome have openly questioned how much time
and money should be invested in a project that seems perpetually bogged down
in non-human conflict.  So, we took that question to Senator Ronald Quantrell.

<p>
<dt>
* * *

<p>
<dt>
<b>Senator Ronald Quantrell.  Chairman: Babylon 5 Senate Oversight
Committee.</b> (in his office)
<dd>
Well, obviously, Babylon 5 is something President Santiago believed in very
strongly and I think we owe it to his memory to try to make it work.

<p>
<dt>
Torqueman
<dd>
That doesn't exactly sound like a ringing endorsement.

<p>
<dt>
<img align=right width=128 height=96 src="/lurk/gif/037/quantrell.gif">
Quantrell
<dd>
Well, clearly we've taken a lot of heat, and the cost overruns have been
appropriately astronomical.  But let's remember that the Babylon Project was
conceived right after the Earth-Minbari war.  At that time, the idea of a
diplomatic station designed to keep anything like that from happening again
was very appealing.<br clear=all>

<p>
<dt>
Torqueman
<dd>
And now?

<p>
<dt>
Quantrell
<dd>
Now?  Well...still too early to tell.  Certainly we've rebuilt our military
forces to a point far in advance of where they were fourteen years ago.  If
the Earth-Minbari war started today, I think things might have gone a little
differently.  So, while I'm not sure how much...concrete benefit we really
derive from Babylon 5 any longer, I suppose it still does keep us in a highly
visible position with other races, and of course it's very important to
interstellar commerce and trade.

<p>
<dt>
* * *

<p>
<dt>
Sheridan
<dd>
Well, with all due respect to Senator Quantrell, speaking as someone who did
his part in the front lines, I'd have to say we still haven't fully recovered
from the Minbari war.  And we haven't anywhere near the level of technology
we would need in the event of another major conflict.  And anybody who thinks
that we could hold our own with the Minbari, the Centauri, and, God forbid, the
Vorlons, is just plain kidding himself.

<p>
<dt>
Torqueman
<dd>
You sound angry about it.

<p>
<dt>
Sheridan
<dd>
No, I'm not.  It just...it just sounds to me like...like jingoism and
self-deception and armchair quarterbacking.  Any time you lose a war, you
just...you just wait a few years, and you'll hear from everyone who thought
that we could have won if they'd have done the fighting.

<p>
<dt>
Torqueman
<dd>
Except, of course, Captain, we didn't lose the war.  The Minbari did
surrender.

Who are the people who run Babylon 5, and what do they do here?  What are
their hopes and dreams?  I'm standing in what's called the Observation Dome,
or C&amp;C, short for Command and Control.  When the Captain is otherwise engaged
with diplomatic or business affairs, this place is under the watchful eye of
its perky and energetic commander, Susan Ivanova.

<p>
<dt>
Commander Susan Ivanova (to a ship)
<dd>
All right, make one more sweep pulling in whatever you got, then head for the
barn.

<p>
<dt>
Torqueman
<dd>
Commander Ivanova, would you mind telling us what it is you're doing here?

<p>
<dt>
Ivanova (showing her a control panel displaying the HAZMAT team)
<dd>
We're investigating Ambassador G'kar's allegations that the Centauri transport
was carrying weapons, justifying his government's attack.  The HAZMAT team
outside is checking the debris for any unusual levels of radiation or trace
elements that could indicate the presence of unauthorized weapons.

<p>
<dt>
Torqueman
<dd>
While we wait for the analysis, would you mind telling us a little about
yourself, how you got here?

<p>
<dt>
Ivanova
<dd>
Well, there's really not much to tell.  I was born in the Russian Consortium,
but spent most of my life at school abroad.  Graduated from OTC ten years ago.

<p>
<dt>
Torqueman
<dd>
How did you come to join Earthforce?

<p>
<dt>
Ivanova
<dd>
After my brother Ganya was killed in the war, I felt that I had to try and
finish what he started.  Of course, as my luck runs, the war was over before I
saw any action.

<p>
<dt>
Torqueman
<dd>
Now, Commander, I'm sure there's more to your story than that.

What do I hope for?  I hope to get through this interview without getting
myself fired.  How's that for a start?  Hmm.  I don't know, it's one of those
questions I don't think about in words.  Maybe because so many times it seems
like, if I say what I want, it never comes.

<p>
<dt>
Torqueman
<dd>
There must be something.

<p>
<dt>
Garibaldi
<dd>
Yeah.  There are...little hopes I guess.  Every day I get up and I hope nothing
will happen.  I'd love to be just bored out of my skull for twenty-four hours.
And, uh, I guess I keep hoping that someday, somewhere I'll make a difference.
That at the end of the day, everything we've gone through for the past few
years will, uh, mean something.

<p>

Ivanova (over communicator)

So far, we've spent most of our time here talking to the humans, but aliens
make up nearly forty-two percent of Babylon 5's population.  Many of them live
here in the so-called "Alien Sector," which provides alternate atmospheres for
fourteen different species.  Ironically, the "Alien Sector" is how the aliens
here refer to the human part of the station proving once again that beauty...
and the beast...are in the eye of the beholder.  Probably the most elusive of
all the aliens is Ambassador Kosh Naranek, a representative of the Vorlon
Empire, sent here roughly two years ago.  Nothing is known of the Vorlons, in
fact three expeditions sent into Vorlon space over the years have never
returned.  The Vorlon government said they had met with accidents...and suggested
no further expeditions.  Even their appearance is a mystery, compounded by the
fact that Ambassador Kosh can only leave his quarters in an encounter suit,
which contains his atmosphere and other life support equipment.  A few moments
ago, while we were setting up this shot, we got our first glimpse of the
Vorlon as he was leaving his quarters just behind me.  This is an ISN
exclusive, presented here for the first time.

Second in elusiveness to the Vorlon is Ambassador Delenn of the Minbari
Federation.  After initially refusing several requests for an interview, she
finally agreed to talk to us.

<p>
<dt>
<hr>

<p>
<dt>
Torqueman
<dd>
Since very few humans have ever been allowed on Minbar, perhaps you could
start by telling us a little about your world.

<p>
<dt>
<b>Ambassador Delenn.  Minbari Federation.</b>
<dd>
We are the seventh planet from our sun
<em>[a graphic of Minbar appears over her
shoulder].</em>
Almost one quarter of Minbar is covered by our north polar icecap.
Because our world is rich with crystalline deposits, many of our cities are
cut directly out of crystal formations.  During the spring, the patterns of
color caused by the light are breathtaking.  Let's see, what else?  We have
three basic languages, Len'au, Feek, and Audronado, which is the language of
the Religious Caste.

I volunteered for this change, in the hope that it would lead to a better
understanding between our peoples.

Over a quarter million humans were killed in the war with your people.  How
do you think the families of those victims will feel about your...change?

I, uh...I don't know.  I uh...I would hope...

<p>
<dt>

I think they would feel hurt, betrayed.  That by assuming a human face, you're
taking a part of us you're not entitled to.  What would you say to them?  To
all the husbands and wives and children and brothers and sisters of the people
who were killed in the war with your people, and now see a Minbari...with a
human face?

We've just been informed that there's been a new development in the Narn
attack.  The Babylon 5 Advisory Council and the League of Non-Aligned Worlds
have been convened to hear this update.  We've been given permission to record
these proceedings in the council chambers.

<p>

G'kar

And now, thanks to Commander Ivanova's investigation, we have proof of what
we've been saying all along.  An inspection of the destroyed Centauri has
found conclusive proof that she was carrying fusion bombs and support
equipment for ion cannons, mass drivers, and heavy-energy weapons!

grounds that Babylon 5 is neutral territory, and is not to be used as a

The "nonsense" Captain Sheridan referred to is the Narn-Centauri war, which,
over the past several months, has grown into a conflict which threatens to spill
into other systems and lead to an escalation of hostilities.  Prior to the
battle we just witnessed, ISN spoke with representatives from both sides, in
order to better understand the history of this conflict.

<p>
<dt>
<hr>

<p>
<dt>
G'kar
<dd>
Roughly one hundred and fifty of your years ago, the Centauri came to our
world.  Narn was a green and fertile place then.  We greeted them in peace,
and spent the next hundred years in chains.  But we never gave up hope.  We
formed a resistance, learned their secrets, turned their own machines against
them, and finally drove them from our world.

<p>
<dt>
Torqueman
<dd>
How did you become involved with the resistance?

<p>
<dt>
G'kar
<dd>
My family lived in G'kamizad, one of the larger cities on Narn.  My father...
served in a Centauri household during the last years of the rebellion.  I was
barely a pouchling at the time.  My mother was ill, unable to escape through
the underground, so we all stayed.  It was a difficult time--we were striking
deep into Centauri resources.  Things were tense.  One day, my father spilled
a cup of hot jala on the mistress of the house, and...and she had him killed.
They took him out, tied his hands together, and hung him from a Jalwa tree for
three days.  I came to him the last night against my mother's orders, and he
looked down at me.  He said he was proud and to go and fight and...be all the
things he never was.  Then he died.  The next morning I ran away and killed my
first Centauri.

<p>
<dt>
Torqueman
<dd>
Why do you think they invaded back then?

<p>
<dt>
G'kar
<dd>
Why does any advanced civilization seek to destroy a less-advanced one?
Because the land is strategically valuable, because there are resources that
can be cultivated and exploited, but most of all, simply because they can.
You have experienced much the same on your own world.  There are humans for
whom the words "never again" carry special meaning, as they do for us.

<p>
<dt>
Torqueman
<dd>
How do you respond to reports that your military has lost six out of the last
seven engagements with the Centauri forces, and now the war consists mainly of
holding actions and forced retreats?

<p>
<dt>
G'kar
<dd>
Centauri propaganda.  We will never fall back.  We will never surrender.

<p>
<dt>

<p>
<dt>
Londo
<dd>
When we first met the Narn they were, what, a primitive people.  We gave them
technology centuries ahead of their own, took them with us to the stars,
taught them laws, civilized them.  They repaid us with terror and death.

<p>
<dt>
Torqueman
<dd>
So you're saying that the Centauri originally came to help the Narns?

<p>
<dt>
Londo
<dd>
Of course.  And at considerable expense, I might add.  Which is why we finally
left.  We wished them well, but the cost, you've seen.

<p>
<dt>
Torqueman
<dd>
Then you weren't driven off the Narn homeworld?

<p>
<dt>
Londo
<dd>
Please.  The Narn have rewritten history enough, don't you think?  If they
wanted us gone, we were hardly going to force the issue.  But ever since, they
have grown more and more irrational, have gone out of their way to harm us,
to seize Centauri territory.  Finally, we had to take a stand.  They were the
ones who declared war.  Not us.  We want only peace.

<p>
<dt>
<hr>

<p>
<dt>
Torqueman
<dd>
"We want only peace."  Both sides say the same thing.  But as we've just seen,
the reality is anything but peaceful.  With the skirmish outside concluded,
and the captured Centauri vessels about to undergo a complete search, things
seem to have calmed down a bit.

that events such as those you've just witnessed were typical of the situation
on Babylon 5.  Like anyone else, they have good days and bad days.  But there
can be no question that it is a flash point that can only grow hotter as time
passes.  And yet, growth only comes through pain and struggle, so perhaps we
should allow Babylon 5 time to realize, or one day, even exceed the dreams we
have invested in it.  We'll be back with some concluding thoughts right after
this message.

After the crisis was over, the debris cleared, and the bodies counted, we
asked each of the people involved in this story one question: Given the
danger, at the end of the day, as Mr. Garibaldi said, is it worth it?

Absolutely.  Sure, when things get tense out here, we have to be careful.  Our
search of the Centauri vessels we captured proved that they were bringing in
weapons of mass destruction, offloading them outside the station, and sending
'em on to the front lines.  Now that we know that, we can make sure it doesn't
happen anymore.  We learn.  That's what humans do.

Misunderstandings aside...yes, I definitely think it's worth it.  We must simply
work harder to make sure we communicate with each other to prevent this sort
of tragic situation from ever happening again.  A violent attack by Narn forces
is an unacceptable response to a peaceful protest by my government.  And with
the intervention of Earth, perhaps we can keep them from making a similar mistake
in the future.

Of course it is.  For the simple reason that no one else will ever build a
place like this.  Humans share one unique quality: they build communities.  If
the Narns or the Centauri or any other race built a station like this, it
would be used only by their own people.  But everywhere humans go, they create
communities out of diverse, and sometimes hostile, populations.  It is a great
gift and a terrible responsibility--one that cannot be abandoned.

All right, med 2.  Go.  Go.  (to Torqueman)  Look, if we weren't here right
now, half the people in this room would be dead.  That should be a good
enough answer for anyone.

Yes, but not for any of the reasons that you've probably been told.  The job of
Babylon 5 is not to enforce the peace, it's to create the peace.  And this place
was built on the assumption that we could work out our problems and build a
better future.  And that, to me, is the key issue.  See, in the last few years,
we've stumbled.  We've stumbled at the death of the president, the war, and
on and on.  And when you stumble a lot, you...you start looking at your feet.
You know, we have to make people lift their eyes back to the horizon and see
the line of ancestors behind us saying, "Make my life have meaning."  And to
our inheritors before us saying, "Create the world we will live in."  We're
not just...holding jobs and having dinner.  We're in the process of building
the future.  That's what Babylon 5 is all about.  Only by making people understand that
can we hope to create a better world for ourselves, and our posterity.
