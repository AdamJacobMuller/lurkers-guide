Garibaldi is trying to put together an old motorcycle when he's visited by
Lennier.  Shaal Mayan (cf.
<a href="/lurk/guide/007.html">"The War Prayer"</a>)
is about to visit the station again, and, given what happened the last time
she was there, Delenn wants to arrange extra security.  After delivering the
message, Lennier takes an interest in Garibaldi's bike -- a 1992 Kawasaki
Ninja in mint condition.  Garibaldi has been trying to assemble it for years.
He has all the parts and a manual, but it's in Japanese.  Lennier offers
to help, and Garibaldi gives him the manual.
<p>
<img align=middle src="/lurk/gif/016/len-gar.gif"> Lennier accepts the manual.
<p>
Two men, one with a scar by his right eye, are looking at a file about
Ivanova.  "What do you think?" asks the scarred man.
<p>
"Most of the personnel will be no trouble.  This one, however..."
<p>
"Anything you can't handle?"
<p>
"I don't <em>have</em> to handle it.  Her record's spotless.  There's no
reason to include her."
<p>
"That's not your decision.  And she <em>will</em> be included.  Records don't
always tell the whole story.  That's one of the reasons you're here, Mr. Gray.
Remember?"
<p>
"As you wish.  When do we begin?"
<p>
"As always, Mr. Gray, when the time is right."
<p>
Sinclair meets with Garibaldi and Ivanova.  A recent attack on Station
Phobos, on one of Mars' moons, has been tied to Martian separatist groups,
perhaps Free Mars, or one of the even more radical groups.  Earthforce is
concerned that Babylon 5 will be used as a transfer point to ship arms to
the rebels.  Ivanova points out that it'll be hard to stop; the station's
trade agreements with many of the aliens allow them to sell arms.  Sinclair
tells the two of them to keep a close watch on incoming and outgoing ships,
and notify Earthforce of any that are carrying weapons.
<p>
The scarred man, meanwhile, is sitting next to a security officer, Welch,
and begins
to ask him about the station and about Sinclair.  He introduces himself as
Aaron Franks, of Quartermaster Corporation, and says his company is interested
in becoming one of Babylon 5's suppliers.  Welch brushes him
off; Franks goes to another station crewman and starts talking to him.  Welch
notifies the security station.
<p>
<img align=middle src="/lurk/gif/016/burger.gif"> Welch tries to eat his
lunch.
<p>
Lennier watches a file on the history of motorcycles on Earth, and is
fascinated by what they once represented.  "Sexual prowess and rebellion,"
he muses.
<p>
Garibaldi watches Franks talk to a bartender.  When Franks leaves, Garibaldi
asks the bartender what he wanted.  He was asking about Sinclair -- how often
he comes to the bar, who he drinks with, and so on.
<p>
Garibaldi catches up with Sinclair and tells him that Franks, and an
associate, Harriman Gray, both listed as representatives of Quartermaster,
have been asking all sorts of questions.  Sinclair tells Garibaldi to look
into it, as it might be a cover for arms shipments; Quartermaster is a
major military supplier.  "Walk softly," Sinclair cautions.  "The last thing
we need is a corporate lawsuit."
<p>
Gray is in his quarters when Garibaldi comes to the door.  Gray slips on
a pair of black gloves and, somewhat flustered, tries to convince Garibaldi
that he and Franks are there to negotiate a deal to supply the station.
Just then, Franks arrives.  He offers Garibaldi a drink, and is pleasantly
surprised when Garibaldi turns him down.  He tells Garibaldi that his name
isn't Franks at all.  He's Colonel Ari Ben Zayn, of Internal Investigations,
and Gray is a military specialist from Psi-Corps.  They're on the station,
Ben Zayn says, to conduct a special investigation of Babylon 5's command
staff.
<p>
Later, Ben Zayn talks to Sinclair, Ivanova, and Garibaldi.  With the recent
events on Mars and elsewhere, Earthforce needs to know who's loyal and who
isn't.  Sinclair vouches for his crew, and objects to Ben Zayn's tactic of
questioning people without his knowledge.  Ben Zayn says he has ever right
to do so; his authority comes directly from the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  He
says he's not here to persecute anyone; it's a routine investigation.
<p>
<img align=middle src="/lurk/gif/016/brief.gif"> Ben Zayn briefs the command
staff.
<p>
Ivanova objects to the presence of Gray; regulations prohibit the use of
telepaths in routine investigations.  Ben Zayn tells her there are new
regulations; all staff must submit to scans.  Ivanova refuses, growing
angry, but Sinclair stops her and says he'll check the regulations himself.
Ben Zayn attaches Garibaldi to his staff over Sinclair's objections, and
the two of them leave Sinclair and Ivanova alone in Sinclair's office.
Ivanova reiterates her refusal to submit to a scan.
<p>
Garibaldi tells Ben Zayn he thinks the whole investigation is a sham.  Ben
Zayn orders Garibaldi to collect all the files -- including classified ones --
on the station's staff, and report back with them later that night.
<p>
Lennier intercepts Garibaldi in the hallway and says he's managed to
translate the manual.  He offers to help with the bike; Garibaldi eventually
agrees.
<p>
In his office, Garibaldi instructs the computer to put together the files Ben
Zayn requested.  While that's going on, he tells it to find out all it can
about Ben Zayn and Gray.
<p>
Gray pays a visit to C&amp;C, where Ivanova is on duty.  As she tries, without
a hint of subtlety, to brush him off, he tells her that as a child, he wanted
nothing more than to be a pilot.  He worked for it, applied to the academy,
was accepted -- and then his talents were discovered.  It is against the
law for psis to serve in the regular military, but Psi Corps offered him
a chance to work in its military branch.  It's not the same thing as Ivanova's
brand of soldiering, he says, "but half a dream is better than none."
<p>
Ivanova isn't moved at all.  And when Gray says he won't intrude on her
privacy, just scan those thoughts pertaining to her duty, she lashes out,
exclaiming that such a scan isn't only an assault on her, but on her honor.
"If you enter my mind for any reason," she continues, seething, "I will
twist your head off and use it for a chamberpot!"
<p>
Later, Ben Zayn is grilling Garibaldi about Sinclair's actions -- specifically,
the fact that he failed to so much as file a complaint about the Vorlons'
destruction of Deathwalker's ship (cf.
<a href="/lurk/guide/009.html">"Deathwalker"</a>.)
Garibaldi points out that it'd be useless to complain to the Vorlons anyway,
and suggests Ben Zayn ask Sinclair about such things directly.  Ben Zayn
answers that he intends to, at 1200 hours, and tells Garibaldi to inform
Sinclair, then get some sleep.
<p>
Garibaldi goes to Sinclair, who has taken over for Ivanova in C&amp;C.  He is
concerned that maybe Sinclair <em>does</em> have something to hide:  "I know
you're a by-the-book kind of guy, but let's face it, we've had to rewrite
the book a few times to make B5 work."  Garibaldi warns Sinclair to watch
out for Ben Zayn; he's dangerous, as is Gray.  Sinclair promises to take
care of it all, and tells Garibaldi to get to bed.
<p>
When Garibaldi returns to his quarters, he finds Lennier chanting over the
motorcycle.  "I am about to embark upon the mysteries of the 'fuel injection
system,'" Lennier says.  Garibaldi tells him to come back sometime after
1200 the next day.  After Lennier leaves, Garibaldi inspects the bike.  "Not
bad," he says.  "Not bad at all."
<p>
Ivanova has a bizarre dream, in which her mother is injected with drugs by
two dark men in masks.  Gray is there, warning Ivanova not to interfere.
"Only one way out," says Ivanova's mother as she's injected.  Then it's
Ivanova, not her mother at all, who's being held by the masked men.  "Only
one way out," she says, dazed.  Ivanova bolts awake in bed, covered in sweat.
<p>
<img align=middle src="/lurk/gif/016/dream.gif"> Ivanova's mother loses
consciousness.
<p>
Sinclair is in his quarters, studying regulations, when Ivanova comes in
and offers her resignation, the only way to avoid the scan.  Sinclair assures
her it's not necessary -- he's found a way around the scans.  He asks why
she's so afraid of being scanned, anyway; didn't her mother make contact
with her?
<p>
"Yes, she did," answers Ivanova.  "You can't imagine what it's like.  To share
your own mother's love for you.  To feel it in your thoughts.  No one's ever
been that close to me, Commander.  And no one must <em>ever</em> intrude upon
that memory.  Especially Psi Corps."
<p>
Ben Zayn studies a file about Sinclair.  When Gray asks why, Ben Zayn says
he wants to know everything he can about Sinclair, part of the reason Gray
is there.  When Gray objects, claiming such things are against the rules,
Ben Zayn tells him to stop being naive, and says that Bester (cf.
<a href="/lurk/guide/006.html">"Mind War"</a>)
will appreciate anything Gray can do.
<p>
Sinclair arrives and says he'll be ready to begin as soon as Gray leaves
the room.  He says he studied the regulations carefully, and found that a
telepath can only be used to determine the truth of answers to specific
charges, not for routine loyalty tests.  Gray sides with Sinclair: "Even
Psi Corps doesn't consider it a carte blanche rule."
<p>
"I don't remember asking for your opinion," Ben Zayn answers angrily, but
he dismisses Gray.
<p>
Gray visits Ivanova in a lounge.  She's surprised to see him, but he
explains that Sinclair knows the regulations better than Ben Zayn.  "I will
long savor the look on the Colonel's face," he says.  "Not many people are
willing to stand up to him.  It was very refreshing."
<p>
<img align=middle src="/lurk/gif/016/gray.gif"> Gray talks with Ivanova.
<p>
Ivanova says Gray doesn't seem like other Psi Corps people; she finds his
dislike of Ben Zayn unexpected.
<p>
Gray answers that he has no love for Ben Zayn; he's efficient, but lacks
compassion.  "As for Psi Corps, I doubt you really know any of our people
very well.  Especially Miss Winters."
<p>
"You're scanning me," Ivanova objects.
<p>
"I'm sorry.  The thought of Miss Winters was very loud in your mind when I
mentioned Psi Corps.  I couldn't help but pick it up.  Please, forgive me.
I <em>am</em> surprised you were aware of it."  He pauses.  "Of course.
She must have been in your mind numerous times before she was given the
sleepers.  Your mother."
<p>
Ivanova is furious, and demands that Gray not mention her mother again.
Before she can say more, she's called to C&amp;C.
<p>
Sinclair is defending his handling of the dockworkers' strike (cf.
<a href="/lurk/guide/012.html">"By Any Means Necessary"</a>)
when Ivanova calls in from C&amp;C with a matter demanding his attention.
<p>
Ben Zayn tells her to handle it on her own.  That's too much for Sinclair,
who says he won't tolerate Ben Zayn disrupting the operation of the station.
He gets up to leave, but Ben Zayn blocks his path.  "I've seen plenty like
you," he says.  "Hotshots promoted through the ranks without any real
leadership ability."  He assumes control of Babylon 5, relieving Sinclair.
Garibaldi barely stops Sinclair from slugging Ben Zayn.
<p>
<img align=middle src="/lurk/gif/016/bait.gif"> Ben Zayn baits Sinclair.
<p>
Sinclair, says Ben Zayn, quoting a regulation, is working against the best
interests of Earthforce, and he can prove it with Mr. Gray's help.  Which,
now that he is bringing up specific charges, he is within his rights to
demand.  He tells Garibaldi to confine Sinclair to quarters.
<p>
Walking to his quarters with Garibaldi, Sinclair says he'll go straight to
the top and contact HQ.  He tells Garibaldi to get to C&amp;C, where Ben Zayn
is no doubt telling Ivanova he's in charge.
<p>
And, in fact, that's exactly what's happening.  Ben Zayn orders Ivanova to
report along with Sinclair and Garibaldi for a scan in the morning, then
retires to his quarters.  Ivanova tells Garibaldi she won't submit.
<p>
"You'll be charged with insubordination," Garibaldi says.
<p>
"And I'll be replaced and dishonorably discharged.  It's a very Russian
ending.  I should've expected it."  She flees C&amp;C.  Garibaldi catches up to
her.
<p>
"You once offered me a drink," Ivanova says (cf.
<a href="/lurk/guide/003.html">"Born to the Purple"</a>.)
"If that offer's still good, I could sure use it."
<p>
Garibaldi says he has something to take care of, but tells her he'll meet
her in the casino in ten minutes.
<p>
Sinclair speaks with an Earthforce general.  Though he has the power, the
general won't intervene.  It seems there are some powerful people in favor
of the investigation, people Sinclair has made angry over the years, and
with a vote on the President's new immigration
policy coming up in the Senate, the President can't risk upsetting them by
agreeing to stop Ben Zayn.
<p>
A drunk man bumps into Ivanova in the casino.  "Hey, look at the cute
commander," he says, fondling her hair.
<p>
"Cute?" Ivanova asks.
<p>
<img align=middle src="/lurk/gif/016/cute.gif"> "Cute?"
<p>
Garibaldi tells Sinclair that Ben Zayn was among the top ten candidates 
for command of Babylon 5, while Sinclair was... somewhat lower.  Ben Zayn,
Garibaldi has discovered, is also associated with Bester, the Psi Cop whose
partner was killed on the station.  In fact, Bester assigned Gray to Ben
Zayn.  Sinclair speculates that the investigation might be Bester's way of
getting revenge, as he promised he would.  Further speculation is cut short
as Garibaldi is called away; there's a big problem in the casino.
<p>
Ivanova throws punches left and right, holding her own in a huge brawl that's
quickly trashing the entire casino area.  Garibaldi arrives and manages to
calm her down.  He leads her away and tells his men to clean the place up.
<p>
Arriving a few minutes early to his interview, Sinclair finds Gray getting
a feel for the room.  He tells Gray that Bester assigned him to Ben Zayn,
and, in fact, that Bester and Ben Zayn are good friends.  "Maybe you're
scanning the wrong people," he says, just before Ben Zayn walks in.
<p>
Ben Zayn calls Garibaldi and Ivanova in.  Gray instructs Sinclair to remain
calm; the scan won't hurt if he doesn't resist.  Sinclair asks if Gray will
be scanning Ben Zayn too; the regulations, after all, say that all involved
parties are subject to scan, and Ben Zayn is certainly involved.  Besides,
Sinclair says to Ben Zayn, the intent of a question is often as important as
the answer.  "For instance, if I were to ask you why you turned a routine
investigation into a personal hunt for my scalp..."
<p>
Sinclair baits Ben Zayn further, about Bester and the fact that he didn't
get command of Babylon 5.  Ben Zayn says he deserved Babylon 5, but thanks
to the Minbari, Sinclair got it.  He says he knows all about Sinclair and
the Minbari, and soon Sinclair won't be their agent any more.
<p>
<img align=middle src="/lurk/gif/016/scar.gif"> Ben Zayn loses his temper.
<p>
Gray says he can feel the hatred in Ben Zayn's mind, vile and filthy.  Ben
Zayn slaps Gray hard, sending him falling from his chair, then pulls a gun
on Sinclair, Garibaldi, and Ivanova, daring them to try to take it away.
<p>
From the floor, Gray transmits intense pain to Ben Zayn, who stumbles long
enough for Sinclair to grab the gun and knock him down with a punch.  The
investigation, such as it was, is over.
<p>
Later, Garibaldi goes to his quarters, and is dismayed to find Lennier there,
putting the finishing touches on the motorcycle.  "I've been working on
it for years," he says.  "It was sort of my purpose in life.  But now it's...
done."
<p>
Lennier apologizes profusely, but Garibaldi forgives him.  The two of them
inspect Lennier's handiwork.  "Too bad we can't ride it," Garibaldi muses.
<p>
"It is quite ridable," says Lennier.  It seems he installed a clean, efficient
Minbari power source in place of the combustion engine.
<p>
Sinclair and Ivanova talk about the investigation as they walk down a
corridor.  "I never thought I'd be grateful to a member of Psi Corps," says
Ivanova.  "I hope things don't turn out too badly for Mr. Gray."
<p>
The circumstances, Sinclair assures her, will vindicate Gray.  As for Bester,
he'll stay in the shadows, but most likely the whole affair will have some
repercussions on Bester, too.
<p>
As Sinclair and Ivanova enter a transport tube, Garibaldi and Lennier zip
by on the motorcycle.  "It's good to have things back to normal," quips
Ivanova as the bike zooms up the curve of the corridor.
