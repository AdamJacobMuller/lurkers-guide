Commander Ivanova finds Garibaldi and Zack busy mocking two Drazi
missionaries seeking assistance in the docking bay; they claim to have been
drawn to
B5 by reports that Droshalla, a Drazi holy being has
blessed the station.  (In typical unfathomable Drazi fashion, their
attempts to share Zack's blessing are easily transferred to a nearby plant.)
With relative unconcern Ivanova asks Garibaldi to investigate a set of
anonymous messages to C&C declaring a countdown to chaos. The threats become
reality moments later when a lurker is blown to bits by a booby trap in
Downbelow.  

<p>
Still in Docking, Zack's day improves further when the arrival of a chapter
of monks interrupts his attempts to respond to the explosion.  In Downbelow,
the heavy damage and confusion mystify the crew.  Although Garibaldi
determines that it was a bomb, he can't find anything worth blowing up.

Meanwhile Ivanova is unable to dissuade Brother Theo from his flock's
determination to establish a mission on the station.  When she points out
that the aliens passing through B5 may not want to be preached at, that
there is little space and that they will be in the way, he readily replies
with both the words of the Bible and the fact that the monks themselves
happen to be engineers and computer experts. <br clear=all>

Lennier is afflicted with a garrulous human neighbor while waiting in
reception for Delenn to disembark.  He rises to greet her at the gate just
as there is an explosion in the corridor behind.  Lennier hauls her
forward then steps past the gate to hustle Ambassador Mollari (who happens
to be arriving as well) to safety just as the pressure doors close.  Delenn
watches in horror through the transparent frame as Lennier is licked by
flames and struck by falling objects.  

<p>
A staff meeting clarifies that these blasts are aimed at people, not
installations, and are being effective in their apparent purpose of
spreading chaos and terror.  Sheridan orders martial law and the bomber
watches its imposition with satisfaction.  While Lennier hovers in a coma,
G'Kar rails at Garibaldi about the Centauri responsibility for the
explosions and Londo insists to the captain and commander that the Narn are
widening the range of their terror tactics.  But the truth is that there is
no sense to the attacks, and no one is claiming responsibility.

Londo manages to convince a doctor to let him stay with Lennier.  Though his
bedside manner probably needs improvement, Londo seems to have been genuinely
moved by the young Minbari saving his life.

<p>
Meanwhile security determines from a molecular trace of the bomb materials
that they were stolen from an ice mine on Beta 7, and that the bomber seems
to have struck before on Proxima 3.  Garibaldi balks when Sheridan orders a
full investigation of all traffic from there to B5 cross checked against
possible gloaters filmed by security cameras after the blasts. Ivanova has
the bright idea of putting the new engineering monks to use.

<p>
Londo promises the unconscious Lennier to return, and departs on an errand.
Upon finding the transport tube occupied by a smoldering G'Kar, at first he
refuses to enter, but an instant later he leaps inside to escape a rush of flame
from a bomb blast further down the corridor.  Two hours later he rouses to
find himself trapped in the damaged tube under the pitiless eyes of the
former Narn ambassador.  Londo proposes a plan of escape before the flames
outside suffocate them, but with exquisite mirth G'Kar refuses.  Though he'd
like to live he would be delighted to watch Mollari die.  

<p>

The monks are successful, and Brother Theo points out to Garibaldi the most
likely suspect.  As a tac team in full armor assembles  to go after the
bomber, G'Kar croons and cackles to his nemesis, "Not many fishes left in the
sea/Not many fishes, just Londo and me."<br clear=all>

<p>

The team gathers  near the bomber's quarters, but he's prepared for them and
demands to speak to the captain alone.  Sheridan stuffs his link down his
pants and agrees to go in to negotiate. Garibaldi orders C&C not to let anyone
beep the captain under any
circumstances.  The bomber wants free passage off the station, but lets slip
that the deadman switch he carries will set off a bomb to make the station
explode like the sun.  This twigs Garibaldi to the fusion reactor.  He
sends a squad to check it out, and as they scramble into action the bomber
attempts to terrorize the captain. All he manages is to get Sheridan thoroughly infuriated
with his threats, and to send his own nerves haywire. Why is he bombing things? His only reason is that the times are chaotic.

<p>

The squad finds the bomb in the reactor, just before Sheridan sits on his
link.  When he hears the beep the bomber panics.  In the ensuing struggle
the deadman switch drops, transmitting to the bomb just as it's propelled
harmlessly away from the station.

<p>
When the battered and damaged Lennier finally comes around, he explains that
he saved Mollari's life at the risk of his own because "all life is sacred.
But when the object of your actions does not share that belief... ahh,  I
fear that I have served the present by sacrificing the future."  

<p>
In the "last of the debris" from the last explosion on board, a rescue team
comes upon the two nearly asphyxiated enemies in the transport tube.  They
curse each other with familiarity.

"Bastard."  Londo utters.

<p>
"Monster."

<p>
"Fanatic!"

<p>
"Murderer!"

<p>
"You are insane!"

<p>
"That is why we'll win," G'Kar gasps.

<p>
"Go be the ambassador to Babylon 5 they said.  It will be an easy position.
I hate my life."

<p>
"So do I."

<p>
"Shut up!"
