Sheridan is on a baseball field, practicing his swing, when Garibaldi
arrives.  Sheridan explains that, because of difficult negotiations
between the Narn and
the Centauri, he needed to take time to get away from it all.
Garibaldi says that, despite his problems, Sheridan should be glad that he
didn't have to spend his day in the Triangle.  Sheridan asks about it, and
Garibaldi explains it is a section of Grey Sector nicknamed by maintenance
where there are strange lights, sounds, and disappearances.  That piques
Sheridan's interest, and despite Garibaldi's objection, he insists on
going and taking a look.<br clear=all>

Londo and Vir step out of an elevator, discussing the authors and songs of
some of the finest Centauri operas.  They lose themselves in the music, and
continue reminiscing when a black robed figure appears, arms wrapped around
Londo's neck.  "How fitting you should die with a song on your lips,
Mollari," the figure tells him.  The figure calls him "passo liati," and
Londo knows who it is -- an old friend of his, Urza Jaddo.  Londo
asks Urza not play such a trick again, and introduces Vir and Urza to
each other.  Londo suggests they return to his quarters, drink brevare and
talk, but Urza has to decline, promising they will do so later.<br clear=all>

Sheridan, flashlight in hand, walks down one of the corridors in the
Triangle.  After searching around for a few moments, he sees a body lying
on the floor.  He tries to wake the figure, but sees that the
being, a Markab, is dead.  Sheridan tries to call Garibaldi, but
interference makes maintaining a clear channel very difficult.  Sheridan
looks at the body again, and its hand suddenly reaches up and grabs his
face.  Sheridan is able to wrench the hand away, and the body falls down
dead again.  Sheridan finally contacts Garibaldi and tells him to get to
Gray 10 right away.

<p>
Dr. Franklin examines Sheridan and tells him that there is nothing
physically wrong with him, except for the common effects of a sudden
fright.  He also explains that the body's movements were due to gas buildups
inside the body.  Sheridan asks what killed the Markab, and Franklin
hypothesizes head trauma, but will not know for certain without an autopsy.
Garibaldi finds the Markab's identicard and identifies him.
Sheridan tries to explain how they should proceed next, but his vision becomes
very distorted.  Sheridan tells Garibaldi that he feels dizzy,
and Garibaldi recommends that Sheridan rest and hear a report later.

<p>
Londo begins preparing drinks, and Vir asks about Urza.  Londo explains that
they had been friends since childhood, though their families had been allied
almost since the beginning of the Republic.  Londo begins reminiscing about
his youth, even though Vir doesn't understand why Londo's ties to the past
are so strong.  Urza enters, and Londo greets him.  They drink together.

<p>

In his quarters, Sheridan is awakened by some strange
sounds.  He turns on the lights, looks around
the room a little, and is confronted by a large flying creature, which flies
at him.  He manages to duck and grab a PPG; he fires at the
creature, but the shots go through it and destroy a statue behind
it.  Garibaldi, alerted by the gunfire, enters with another security officer.
Garibaldi asks what happened, and Sheridan explains that the
creature was a grylor, from Janos VII, which once stalked him.  Garibaldi
suggests that it may have been a nightmare, but Sheridan knows, or at
least believes, it was real.  Sheridan asks what happened to the Markab, and
Garibaldi says it looks like suicide, though they don't know why he would have
killed himself.  Sheridan suggests it may have been a religious ritual, but
Garibaldi disagrees.  Sheridan tells Garibaldi to keep searching for
answers, and says he'll be in C&C if needed.

Urza and Londo, still drinking, are getting reacquainted, talking about life
and love.  When they stop to get another drink, Urza tells Londo that his
name is much spoken of on Centauri Prime, and that they believe that both his
star, and that of the Republic, is in ascension again.  This pleases Londo,
though he is still quite angry at the Narns.  Urza says that the previous
Emperor wanted peace, but Londo claims that the Emperor was wrong about the
Narns.  Urza explains that the Narns were lured into the war by the same
faction that murdered the previous Prime Minister, which Londo says he heard
was an accident.  Urza tells him that was the "official story," but not
really true.  Urza tells Londo that a resolution is about to be brought
before the Centaurum, claiming that Urza's family is traitorous to the
Republic.  Londo believes they couldn't prove it, but Urza says proof isn't
necessary, only the accusation, and that he will be disgraced if the
"villains" have their way.  Urza asks Londo to stand with him to save his
family, and Londo says he will do what he can.  This pleases Urza, who
leaves, promising a banquet to celebrate their reunion.

<p>
Sheridan enters C&C as a jump gate comes online and a ship comes through.
While looking at a control panel, Sheridan begins seeing strange patterns
again.  He tries to clear his eyes, but when he looks out the viewport, he
sees the Icarus, his wife's ship, appear and then explode.  Sheridan orders
the area outside scanned, but no one else has seen anything.  Ivanova asks
if anything is wrong, and Sheridan says that he has to see to something.

<p>
Sheridan explains what just happened to Dr. Franklin, who tells
him that there is nothing physically wrong with him, but that there may
be a new virus that can't be detected.  He offers to put Sheridan in touch
with a Markab doctor who may be able to help him, but suggests that his
hallucinations are more likely stress-related.  Dr. Franklin puts Sheridan on
medical leave, and, despite Sheridan's protests, Franklin orders him to
relax and enjoy himself.

<p>
Londo finally makes contact with Refa.  Londo asks Refa if what he heard
about Urza was true, and Refa says it is.  Londo offers to vouch for Urza
personally, but Refa won't go along, despite Londo's claims of being Urza's
friend.  Refa says he cannot stop the resolution, because it has already
gone through.  Refa says that Urza's house is already crumbling, and anyone
that tries to help will go along with it.  Londo becomes outraged at Refa's
impudence, claiming that Refa's plans would have been no use without his help.
Refa says there is little he can do, but promises he will try.  Londo tells
Vir to get him a drink, and then communicate with his contacts on Centauri
Prime, as he will need more help.

<p>
Sheridan is back on the baseball field practicing when Garibaldi enters.
Sheridan asks if they found out anything else about the Markab, and
Garibaldi tells him that the Markab passed through sector 14 on his voyage
here.  Sheridan says he thought that sector was restricted, and Garibaldi
explains it is, ever since the incident the previous year when Babylon 4
returned.  Garibaldi explains that it was kept out of the station logs
because EarthForce wanted to perform their own investigation.  Garibaldi
explains what happened to Sheridan, saying that, even though the station is
gone, an anonmaly is still believed to remain.  Garibaldi presents Sheridan
with a copy of the information, made before it was turned over to
EarthForce, and leaves Sheridan to his batting practice.

<p>
Londo and Vir enter the exquisitely decorated and catered banquet, where
they meet up with Urza.  The three of them sit down at a table, and Urza
toasts to their friendship and to the Republic.  Londo comments on the
calibre of the guests at the party, and Urza tells him that, with Londo's
help, they will spread the word.  Londo tells him that this isn't necessary,
since he helped, but Urza says that the resolution was already presented,
and will almost certainly pass.  Londo begins saying that Refa promised to
help, but this angers Urza, who says that Refa is responsible for the
resolution in the first place, and
wants him out of the way because of how much he knows.  Urza seems insulted
that Londo would help Refa, but Londo says that he has a destiny to fulfill,
and only if he does, will the Centauri return to their rightful place in the
galaxy.  Urza says he doesn't want to return to that kind of glory, and
Londo offers to help, but Urza tells him that the way they are proceeding
will never do any good.

<p>
<img align=right width=160 height=114 src="/lurk/gif/039/gift.gif">
Londo offers to leave, but Urza will not let him
go.  He snaps his fingers, and a large case is brought to the table, from
which Londo draws a finely-crafted sword.  Londo says he cannot accept the
gift, but Urza takes the sword from him and embeds it in the table,
challenging him to a duel to the death.  Londo asks why he would do this,
and Urza tells him he would do it to save himself and his family from
dishonor.  Londo accepts the challenge, and Urza tells him to return in two
hours for the duel.  Londo and Vir leave.<br clear=all>

<p>
<img align=right width=128 height=96 src="/lurk/gif/039/parents.gif">
Sheridan is watching some images of Babylon 4's return when he is suddenly
gripped by a powerful headache.  He looks around the room in agony, his
vision again blurred, and he sees his parents standing there.  He
approaches them, but they are enveloped in a bright flash of light.
Sheridan looks over at the frozen picture of Babylon 4 on the viewscreen,
and believes he knows what to do.  He quickly leaves, leaving his commlink
behind while Dr. Franklin tries to contact him.

<p>
Vir tries to talk Londo out of the duel, but Londo will not hear of it,
saying that to deny the challenge would be disgraceful.

<p>
Garibaldi receives a communication from Dr. Franklin, who asks him where the
captain is.  A device Franklin gave Sheridan to measure his
stress monitored a strange neural surge just a few minutes earlier, which
caused the link to go dead, and Sheridan would not answer communication
requests.  Garibaldi calls his security officers, telling them to look out
for the captain.

<p>
At C&C, a Starfury is detected to be about ready to launch from the station,
and the pilot is identified as Captain Sheridan.  He tells Ivanova not to worry,
and that he will be back soon.  Sheridan overrides the Starfury's controls,
opens the bay doors, and launches the ship.  Ivanova calls Garibaldi.

<p>
Urza's assistants prepare him for the duel when Londo and Vir enter.  Londo
tries to convince Urza to not fight, but Urza refuses.  Urza tells Londo
that he has often beaten him with such weapons, but Londo says that his life
was never on the line before.  Londo begins removing his jacket.

<p>
Garibaldi, in a Starfury of his own, contacts Sheridan asking him what he is
doing.  Sheridan says he is giving someone a lift, and that he thinks the
answer lies in sector 14.  Ivanova, who has been listening, realizes the
significance, and Sheridan confirms her suspicions.  The two Starfuries
continue their voyage.

<p>
A referee tells Londo and Urza to begin the duel.
They hold their swords before them, bow to each other, and begin the fight.
During the course of the fight, they both manage to inflict some damage to
each other.

<p>
<img align=right width=128 height=96 src="/lurk/gif/039/mouth.gif">
Sheridan arrives in sector 14 and tells the computer to scan the area.  The
computer replies, saying it cannot scan the area because of increased levels
of tachyon particles.  A large glowing area appears immediately in front of
Sheridan's Starfury.  Sheridan begins to scream, and a long stream of light
shoots out from his mouth and into the glowing disturbance.  After a few
moments, the stream of light completely vanishes into the disturbance, and
it closes.  Garibaldi, right behind, grapples
Sheridan's ship.  He tows Sheridan back to Babylon 5.<br clear=all>

<p>
<img align=right width=128 height=96 src="/lurk/gif/039/death.gif">
The fight between Urza and Londo continues, both of them very tired, and
somewhat injured.  After a few moments, Urza disarms Londo and sends him
carreening to the ground, and prepares to deal the death blow, but Londo
grabs his sword and thrusts upward.  Urza falls to the ground, but Londo
catches him.  Londo asks Urza why he did this, and Urza tells him that he
did it for his family, because he didn't want them to share in his
disgrace.  This way, Urza dies alone, and Urza makes Londo promise to look
after them, which Londo promises to do.  Urza tells Londo that he will miss
him, and dies in Londo's arms.

<p>
Sheridan explains to Franklin, Garibaldi, and Ivanova that the lifeform that
inhabited him was sentient, but alien, adn was trying to survive and return to
its home.  Sheridan explains that the alien entered the Markab's body and
drove him mad.  He explains that he deduced what it wanted by the images it
created in his mind, using his emotions for communication.  The
prospect of such a new and different alien life form very much excites
Franklin.

<p>
Londo pours some more bravare when Vir enters, telling Londo that the
arrangements he asked for regarding Urza's family were made.  Vir tries to
tell Londo that he didn't have a choice and had to kill Urza, but Londo isn't
sure -- he tells Vir that Urza was more skilled with the blade, and
that, by the rules of the conflict, Urza's family must be taken in by him,
which makes them immune to the effect of the resolution; that was the
reason for the challenge in the first place.  Londo tells Vir that, for the
first time, he questions the choices he has made.  Vir tries to convince
Londo that he should make new
choices, but Londo replies that he has started down the path and
must continue on it until it ends.  He sends Vir away, saying that he
wants to try to get some sleep, if he is able.
