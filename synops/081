<h3>Synopsis by Katrina Glerum (kat@midwinter.com)</h3>

<p>
Once again the station mobilizes for war.  The murder of 10,000 refugees
fleeing Proxima 3 has forced Sheridan to decide that it's time to retaliate
against Clark.

Sheridan calls a full Council meeting first thing in the morning.  In return
for the safety his White Star patrols have brought to uneasy borders, he
declares all League World military treaties with Earth null and void.  As
Starfuries run drills outside, Ivanova requests that each government
contribute a military vessel to the defense of the station.  Other than
that, they must take no part in the war.

<p>
"We're going to take back our home.  Or die trying," Captain Sheridan
concludes.

Marcus races through the station to the War Room with a data crystal that
holds intelligence detailing the Earth Force blockade of Proxima 3.  Of six
destroyers, two were responsible for shooting down the transport.  

<p>
Meanwhile, even though Franklin admits little progress on freeing the
Shadow-implanted telepaths, Sheridan demands that he get them mobile as
quickly as possible for an imminent mission.

<p>
To Ivanova he explains his plan for attacking Proxima 3.  By offering the
combatants a chance to surrender or defect, he will attempt to minimize the
Earth Force losses; nevertheless he will destroy any ship that fights back.

Vir is roused from a nightmare by Garibaldi at the door.  When Garibaldi
asks for Londo, Vir lets it slip out that the Ambassador has gone to speak
with G'Kar, then divulges the plan to attack Earth.  Vir is surprised that
Garibaldi is disgusted with Sheridan's move.  Even though he doesn't always
agree with Londo, Vir says he continues to follow, because sometimes Londo's
right.  

<p>
Close quarters maneuvers continue outside under Lt. Corwin's supervision.
Ivanova orders the fighters to only accept commands that are encrypted with
the code of the day.  Corwin remarks that they should trust no one.  

<p>
"No," Ivanova remarks acerbically.  "Trust Ivanova.  Trust yourself.
Anybody else?  Shoot 'em."

The destroyer Starfuries patrolling hyperspace near the Proxima 3 jump gate
are oblivious to the fleet of White Stars gathering in the murky redness
there.  Marcus learns that the resistance on the planet's surface is being
demolished by Clark's ground forces.

<p>
G'Kar's writing is interrupted by Mollari's entrance.  They take a couple of
shots across each other 's bows until Mollari admits that he didn't come to
fight but to talk.  The past years have been very hard on both of them.
G'Kar snorts in derision, but Mollari continues humbly, thanking G'Kar for
his actions and endurance that set both of their worlds free, telling G'Kar
that he has come to respect him deeply.

<p>
G'Kar scorns both the thanks and the respect.

Mollari forges ahead angrily.  He is a patriot, he shouts, and yet, through
ill judgment he himself became his own enemy.  So can he possibly
"understand who the enemy is?"  Perhaps not.  But he can understand
friendship, and the humans of Babylon 5 have been friends.  Thus he has
convinced his government to put their full support behind Sheridan, and
requests that G'Kar do the same.  Pouring out two drinks, he proposes a
toast "to the humans, and to the bridge that they created between us, in the
hope for a better future, for both our worlds."

<p>
As Mollari waits with glass raised, G'Kar pours his drink back in the
bottle.  With heavy disappointment, Mollari departs.

Sheridan and Ivanova have the difficult task of prepping the Starfury crews
for battle.  They are told to defend themselves with deadly fire and come
home alive, yet show mercy to any non-combatant.

Sheridan departs for the front leaving Ivanova to command the station.  His
flagship White Star 2 sports newly painted Army of Light logos on the wings.

The commander of the fleet blockading Proxima 3 orders two destroyers to
attack the White Stars that jump out of hyperspace on the opposite side of
the planet.  When he recognizes the ships as Sheridan's he orders his
destroyers to attack.  Macdougan, the captain of the Vesta, engages John in
a conversation about the legality of Clark's orders.  When Macdougan refuses
to enter the fray, fleet commander Hall grants a field promotion to
Macdougan's second, a rank he enjoys for about 60 seconds until the Vesta's
crew ends it.

<p>
The Pollux is destroyed, two vessels stand down, and another withdraws.
Fearing a tribunal more than death, Captain Hall orders his crew to continue
the fight until his own second relieves him of command and surrenders.

Sheridan calls the captains of the surviving destroyers together and offers
them the choice of going home or joining up.  When they object to his
methods he argues that they swore to protect Earth, that they work for all
humans, not for Clark in particular.  In the final analysis one ship
withdraws, one joins the defense of Proxima 3, and two join Sheridan.

As he drinks alone again in morose contemplation, Londo notices a shot
raised to the lips of another nearby.  Sternly G'Kar orders Londo to issue
the joint statement of their worlds' support of Sheridan.  He refuses to
sign it on the same page though.  G'Kar departs just as rapidly leaving the
Ambassador choked with emotion.

As the Voice of Resistance announces the victory and encourages other Earth
Force vessels to defect, Garibaldi leaves the station for Mars vowing never
to return.
