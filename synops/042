On Centauri Prime, Londo meets with Lord Refa in the Emperor's throne
room.  Refa explains to Londo that the war with the Narn is about to
end, much sooner than originally expected, and that Londo himself will
be the "architect" of the victory.<br clear=all>

Aboard Babylon 5, Delenn meditates in her quarters.  While she is doing
so, she senses a presence.  "Hello dear friend," she says, and a voice
chuckles all around her.  C&C detects an energy surge coming from
Epsilon 3, and informs Ivanova, who in turn informs Sheridan, just out
of the shower.  Ivanova's message is interrupted by a voice coming from
behind Sheridan.  He turns around and sees Draal standing there.  Draal
tells Sheridan that he has been watching, and introduces himself.
Sheridan tells Draal that he knows Draal took custody of Epsilon 3,
although Draal corrects him saying that the planet took custody of him
instead, returning to him his youth both in appearance and health.
Draal wants to invite Sheridan, and one other, down to the
surface for a visit at Sheridan's earliest convenience.<br clear=all>

G'Sten, G'Kar's uncle, tells G'Kar that the war with the Centauri is
not going well, and that Narn defenses have been severely weakened,
rolling back thirty years of territorial gains.  G'Sten explains
that the Kha'Ri is trying to make the Narn believe that they are
holding their own against the Centauri, though that is far from the
truth.  G'Sten says that their one chance is to attack the Centauri
supply depot at Gorash 7, which will require the entire Narn fleet.  G'Kar
points out that, if the forces are taken away from the homeworld, it
will make it vulnerable.  G'Sten realizes the risk, but insists that
there will only be a very short
period when the homeworld won't be defended.  G'Kar offers to go along,
but G'Sten declines, saying that G'Kar's work on Babylon 5 may be even more
important, and that, were G'Kar's father alive, he would be proud.

<p>
Delenn steps off the elevator and meets Sheridan to tell him that Draal
appeared to her as well.  The two continue on together.<br clear=all>

Refa tells Londo that he strongly believes that the Narn are planning an
attack on Gorash 7.  Londo asks
if Refa's forces will be waiting for the Narn there, and Refa
tells him that he needs Londo's forces there instead, because the
Centauri forces will be carrying out an all-out attack on the Narn
homeworld.  This idea troubles Londo, who tries to convince Refa to
pursue another course of action, but Refa says it isn't necessary -- they
will be using mass drivers, powerful weapons outlawed by every species,
which will decimate the cities, and allow nearly effortless takeover of
the planet.  Londo tells Refa that he is troubled by his allies and
their strength, but Refa doesn't understand his reluctance.  Londo
tries to warn Refa that moving too quickly might cause things to spin
out of control, but Refa won't listen, telling him that numerous
Centauri battleships are waiting hyperspace for Londo's go-ahead, and
that this action will save thousands of Centauri lives.  With
only a little more convincing, Londo agrees to use his allies, as long
as it is for the last time.  Refa assures Londo that this is the last
time their assistance will be needed, as the Narn will be defeated, and
this time, the Centauri will not allow the Narn to be free again.

<p>
Garibaldi expresses great doubt about the message received from Draal,
but Delenn insists that Draal is who he claims.  Even Sheridan is
somewhat troubled by his altered appearance, though Delenn assures them
that he looked that way when he was younger.  Garibaldi suggests it may
be a trick, and that the message might be faked, but Delenn refuses to
believe him.  Ivanova reports that tests run on the message determined
it was sent from below the planet's surface, verifying that Draal did
indeed send it.  Despite this, Garibaldi still wants to send a security
team, but Sheridan says he is only allowed to bring one other, namely
Delenn.

<p>
Londo meets up with Refa again, and Refa tells him that it is time to
leave for the Narn homeworld--they will be on the first ship so they
can oversee the victory personally.  "Come Londo," Refa tells him.
"Destiny awaits."  Meanwhile, Sheridan and Delenn board a shuttle and
head down to Epsilon 3.<br clear=all>

<p>
<img align=right width=128 height=96 src="/lurk/gif/042/medlab.gif" alt="">
G'Kar goes to MedLab, where Dr. Franklin is waiting for him.  Franklin
tells him that one of the Narn refugees he treated was
captured and interrogated by the Centauri, and that the questions
involved the Narn homeworld's defense systems, and were particularly
urgent.  The refugee transport got away easily because the Centauri
warships guarding the planet pulled out with little explanation.  This
puzzles G'Kar, as he knows the Centauri to be very thorough.
Franklin explains to G'Kar that, during the
Earth-Minbari War, the Minbari did something very similar just before
they attacked Earth.<br clear=all>

<p>
<img align=right width=128 height=96 src="/lurk/gif/042/bridge.gif" alt="">
Sheridan and Delenn arrive on Epsilon 3 and begin searching the tunnels
of the planet.  They arrive at a large walkway
across a huge chasm, which strikes Sheridan speechless.

<p>
G'Kar urgently tries to convince G'Sten that the Centauri are planning
to attack the Narn homeworld, but G'Sten won't listen, saying the
mission is too far along to stop it without proof.

<p>
Sheridan and Delenn arrive in Draal's chamber and see his body in the
depression, running the planet.  An image of Draal appears and addreses
them, commending Sheridan for his work aboard Babylon 5.  Draal
explains that he has explored the many secrets of Epsilon 3 and has
learned much about the galaxy, and Sheridan himself.  He also knows
about Sheridan's conspiracy of light.
Sheridan tries to deny it, but Draal knows better,
and assures him the information is safe.  Draal explains that he said a
year earlier that Epsilon 3 would remain dormant until such a time as
it was needed, and that this is such a time -- he's prepared to place
the planet at Sheridan's disposal, one of the first alliances
of the coming war.  Draal tells Sheridan that he is not alone in the
struggle, and that, should they succeed, there is a great possibility
of hope.<br clear=all>

<p>
As G'Kar prays fervently,
the Narn ships come out of hyperspace above Gorash 7 and prepare for
the attack.  They don't detect any ships at first, but several
Shadow ships soon appear and begin moving toward them, ready for the
attack.  G'Sten tries to activate the jump engines, but they must
recharge first.  G'Sten orders an attack against the ships, and though
the Narn score several hits with their energy mines, the weapons of the
Shadows are much more powerful, easily able to cut through the Narn
ships.  The Narn warships are destroyed one by one.  Several warships
combine their firepower and manage to sever a spine from one of the
Shadow ships, but it's a futile victory.  Defeat imminent, G'Sten orders
the remaining ships to
open jump points and flee, but the Shadows fire something into the
vortices, disrupting them and causing the remaining Narn cruisers
to be destroyed mid-jump.  An undamaged Shadow ship connects to the
injured one, revitalizing it; then all the Shadow ships vanish.
G'Kar, sensing the outcome somehow, grimly ceases his prayer.<br clear=all>

<img align=right width=128 height=96 src="/lurk/gif/042/draal2.gif" alt="">
Draal tells Sheridan that it probably isn't a good idea to tell the
Earth government of the new alliance.  Delenn asks Draal if he is
able to handle living alone on the planet.  Draal explains that he has
the stars to keep him company, in addition to the others who live on
the planet and help maintain the machine.  "There is one, in particular,
who..."  He touches his head.  He tells Sheridan that he is hearing
distress calls and that Sheridan needs to leave immediately.  Sheridan
rushes on ahead, and Delenn tells Draal that she hopes to see him more
often.  They exchange a quick goodbye and she leaves.  "So much to do,"
he says, "so little time.  We must get to work.  Zathras!  Zathras!"
he calls, but no one arrives.  "Never around when you need him."

<p>
Ivanova tells Garibaldi about the Centauri attack on the Narn
homeworld, and that she is worried what will happen when word about the
attack hits the station.  He prepares for the coming riots, and says
she should send out a general alert as soon as possible.

<p>
"We interrupt this program with this late-breaking story," says an ISN
reporter, as the patrons of the Zocalo watch.  "Officials in EarthDome
confirm that the Centauri Republic has begun a devestating frontal
assault on the Narn homeworld.  Reports continue to come in, alleging
that the main Narn fleet has been neutralized and that Narn is
completely encircled by its enemies.  Neither government has yet
confirmed nor denied these reports, though some messages relayed from
Narn seem to corroborate the stories of massive destruction and
death...."  The tension becomes too much and a fight between the Narn
and Centauri patrons of the Zocalo breaks out.

<p>
The general alert is sent out as Sheridan and Delenn arrive back on the
station.  Sheridan asks Ivanova what the situation is, and she tells
him that Garibaldi is doing the best he can.  Sheridan has a security officer
escort Delenn to her quarters.  Ivanova explains to Sheridan that she
has heard little more than rumors, though she does know that the
Centauri have used mass drivers in their assault.

<img width=128 height=96 src="/lurk/gif/042/bombard2.gif" alt="">

<p>
The war is not going well for Narn as the Centauri ships use mass
drivers to pummel Narn's cities with asteroids.  As the destruction
continues, Londo watches, helplessly, at a window in the lead ship of
the fleet.

<p>
"With the planetary bombardment in its fourth day," the ISN reporter
reports as the C&C staff watches, "the Narn government continues in
its refusal to surrender.
Minbari, Vorlon, Earth, and other governments have filed official
protests with the Centauri Republic for their use of mass drivers
against the civilian population.  But, so far, the protests have had no
effect.  Although communication with the Narn homeworld is difficult at
best due to the continued attacks, word has reached ISN of cities
utterly destroyed, hundreds of thousands of casualties, the total
elimination of power and water over most of the Narn planetary
surface.  Most of their major cities have fallen, food shipments have
stopped, the planetary economy has collapsed, and medical treatment is
virtually non-existent.  Government analysists predict that, unless the
Narn government surrenders soon, their entire infrastructure will be
totally destroyed.  To quote Senator Ronald Quantrell, 'They're being
bombed back into the stone age.'"  Sheridan can take no more and orders
the feed shut off.

<p>
G'Kar is barely able to maintain contact with the homeworld.  The Narn
on the other end says that the only way to survive is to surrender.
G'Kar asks what will happen to the Narn on Babylon 5, but there is no
way to know what the terms of the surrender will be.  G'Kar offers to
return, but as the only member of the Kha'Ri not on the homeworld,
his contact says, G'Kar should stay alive as long as possible.  The Narn
delivers one
last message to G'Kar from the Kha'Ri, which he says is the hardest
thing he's ever had to ask of G'Kar.

<p>
<img align=right width=128 height=96 src="/lurk/gif/042/sanct.gif" alt="">
G'Kar slowly enters Sheridan's office.  "Captain Sheridan, I... I've
been instructed by government to come to you and ask for... sanctuary."

<p>
Londo arrives at his quarters to find Garibaldi and a contingent of
security guards, placed for his protection, there.  Londo tells
Garibaldi to inform Sheridan that he wishes to convene a meeting of the
advisory council
and the League of Non-Aligned Worlds.

<p>
"A little over five standard hours ago," Londo tells the Council
and the League, "the conflict which began with the Narn declaration of
war came to an end.  The Narn Regime has offered complete and
unconditional surrender.  The terms imposed by the Centauri Republic
are as follows.  One, the ruling body, known as the Kha'Ri will be
disbanded and its members subject to arrest and trial for the
commission of war crimes against the Centauri."

<p>
"Earth requests the right to send observers to these hearings,"
Sheridan says.

<p>
"That request is denied," Londo tells him.  "Two.  To prevent further
acts of terror by the Narn against our people, from this day on, the
penalty for the murder of any Centauri by any Narn will be the
execution of five hundred Narns, beginning with the perpetrator's own
family.  Three.  A provisional ruling council appointed by my
government will take up the responsibility of rebuilding a more
civilized Narn government as a colony of the greater Centauri
Republic."

<p>
"Is there anything else?" Sheridan asks.

<p>
"Yes," Londo replies.  "Just one thing.  Because the Narn homeworld is
now a protectorate of the Centauri Republic, we reserve the right to
determine who can speak for Narn.  As a result, Ambassador G'Kar may no
longer represent the Narn in any official capacity whatsoever.  His
appointment as ambassador to Babylon 5 is hereby withdrawn.  As the
only member of the Kha'Ri still at large, Citizen G'Kar will return to
Narn for trial."<br clear=all>

<p>
<img align=right width=128 height=96 src="/lurk/gif/042/tyrant.gif" alt="">
Sheridan tells Londo that G'Kar has been granted
sanctuary.  Londo tries to protest, saying that the agreement between
the Narn and Centauri had important stipulations about the Kha'Ri, but
Sheridan tells him that neither he nor Earth signed that agreement, so
they are not bound by it.  Delenn stands up, informing Londo that the
Minbari government also stands behind Sheridan's decision, and
that G'Kar may remain for as long as he likes.  Londo gives in, but
demands that G'Kar be removed
from the Council chambers immediately.  G'Kar painfully
complies, but he has a few final words for Londo.  "No dictator... no
invader... can hold an imprisoned population by force of arms forever.
There is no greater power in the universe than the need for freedom.
Against that power, governments and tyrants and armies cannot stand.
The Centauri learned this lesson once.  We will teach it to them
again.  Though it take a thousand years, we will be free."

<p>
Londo watches ISN as the reporter tells of the post-surrender events.
"And dancing in the streets as Centauri Emperor Cartargia declared a
week-long public celebration to commemorate the recapture of the Narn
homeworld.  In related news, the Centauri Republic today announced
plans to annex several smaller worlds adjacent to Narn space, declaring
them protectorates of the Republic.  While government spokesmen insist
that the Centauri do not have any expansionist plans beyond retaking
the Narn homeworld, others in Earthdome are less sure."

<p>
Sheridan tells G'Kar that he will miss G'Kar's imposing presence in the
Council chambers, and that he wants to help G'Kar in any way he can to
win back his planet.  He offers his hand to G'Kar, who hesitates at
first: "The last time I
offered someone my hand, we were at war twenty-four hours later."
As Sheridan leaves,
he is contacted by Ivanova; Delenn wants to see
him in the conference center.  He goes to meet her.<br clear=all>

<p>
<img align=right width=128 height=96 src="/lurk/gif/042/rangers.gif" alt="">
When he arrives, he finds that she and Garibaldi, and a large number of
other humans and Minbari, are in the room, waiting for him.  Delenn
tells him that the people in the room have come to meet him and pledge
themselves to him -- they are the Rangers, Garibaldi explains, who have
been coming through the station to help fight the coming darkness.
Sheridan asks why Garibaldi didn't tell him; Garibaldi says
that he made a promise not to.  Delenn explains to Sheridan that
Babylon 5 must be the fortress of Light to stand against the darkness,
and the Rangers are to help with that.  The Rangers were under her
direct command, but she gives equal authority to Sheridan.

<p>
Sheridan addresses them all.  "I don't quite know what to say... For
the last year, things haven't exactly been going our way.  I was
starting to wonder if it would ever get better.  I think it just did.
Tell the other Rangers, the ambassadors, everyone in this army of Light
that Babylon 5 stands with you.  Tell them... tell them that from this
place, we will deliver notice to the parliaments of conquerers that a
line has been drawn against the darkness, and we will hold that line,
no matter the cost."
