Sinclair and Garibaldi await the arrival of a ship bearing the body of
Branmer, the Minbari general who led the attack on the Line.  Branmer
died on a diplomatic mission and his ship is enroute home, stopping along
the way to let people pay their respects.  The ship -- a Minbari cruiser,
the same kind that Sinclair fought on the Line -- arrives through the
jumpgate.
<p>
On the zocalo, Ivanova is taking a break.  Talia Winters arrives and
sits across the bar from her.  Meanwhile, a girl in scruffy clothing steals
a piece of jewelry from a vendor.  She's spotted, and runs away, then
collapses on the floor, unconscious.  Talia and Ivanova rush to her side.
"She's a telepath," Talia says.
<p>
The Minbari ship approaches the station.  Scans indicate that it's flying
with gun ports open -- armed for a fight.  The captain refuses to explain,
but Delenn arrives at the command center in time to explain that it's
simply a way of honoring a great military leader.
<p>
In medlab, Dr. Franklin reports that the girl appears normal except for
unusually high EEG readings.  Talia explains that she was a latent telepath
whose powers suddenly activated -- probably due to the onset of puberty --
and her mind was unable to cope with the sudden inrush of foreign thoughts.
Talia offers to notify the Psi-Corps so they can send a representative,
but Ivanova objects.
<p>

<p>
A procession bearing Branmer's casket comes aboard.  Neroon, Branmer's
second in command, greets Sinclair and Delenn.  Ivanova and Garibaldi lead
him away to the area they've prepared for the viewing of Branmer's body.
Delenn comments to Sinclair that such a viewing is very unusual, but that
the Star Riders, Branmer's clan, insisted on it.  She seems disturbed.
<p>

<p>
Ivanova arrives in medlab just as the girl awakens.  As she gains
consciousness, she's nearly overwhelmed by the thoughts of the other
people nearby, but Talia teaches her how to block them out.  According to
Talia, who couldn't help picking up the girl's thoughts, her name is
Alisa Belden, and both of her parents are dead.  Ivanova and Talia argue
about who has jurisdiction over Alisa; Ivanova vows that Alisa won't leave
the station if she can help it.
<p>
Neroon won't allow Garibaldi's men to guard Branmer's body until the
viewing ceremony.  He insists on Minbari guards.  He baits Sinclair about
the Line, but Delenn defuses the conversation.
<p>
<img align=middle src="/lurk/gif/017/demand.gif"> Neroon makes his demand.
<p>
The ceremony proceeds normally until the casket is opened.  Branmer's
body is nowhere to be seen.
<p>
Sinclair orders Garibaldi to begin an investigation.  Neroon threatens to
go to war over the issue, claiming that the last incident involving a
Minbari leader, the death of Dukhat (which Garibaldi counters was a
tragic accident) was the cause of the last war.  He's
rebuffed by Delenn, who says that no one clan has the right to dictate
Minbari policy.
<p>
After Neroon and Delenn leave, Ivanova tells Sinclair about Alisa.  Sinclair
says he'll stand behind whatever decision Ivanova makes.
<p>
Later, Sinclair visits Delenn in her quarters.  As she adds pieces to her
crystal sculpture, Delenn tells Sinclair that
Branmer was originally a high priest of the religious caste.  When the holy
war against Earth began, Branmer felt an obligation to go to battle.  He
felt the Minbari cause was just, but obeyed the surrender order when it came.
Another warleader, Sineval, committed suicide rather than obey the order, and
many among the military caste greatly resent the surrender.  Sinclair notes
that Neroon is one of them; he seems to be spoiling for a rematch.

In medlab, Alisa is trying on new clothes, courtesy of the Psi Corps,
while Talia tells her that the Corps will take good care of her once she
joins.  Ivanova arrives and counters with the story of the Corps' treatment
of her mother.
<p>
Neroon intercepts Garibaldi in a corridor.  The investigation is meeting with
no success so far.  An aide rushes up, clutching a piece of Branmer's burial
robe.  He says it was found outside the quarters of the pak'ma'ra -- carrion
eaters.
<p>
Garibaldi and Neroon interrogate one of the pak'ma'ra, who claims ignorance
about the disappearance of Branmer's body.  Convinced that the alien is
hiding something, Garibaldi orders all the pak'ma'ra to have their stomachs
pumped.
<p>
<img align=middle src="/lurk/gif/017/pakmara.gif"> The pak'ma'ra denies
knowledge.
<p>
Na'Toth offers a deal to Alisa: a pampered life on the Narn homeworld in
exchange for periodic tissue samples.  Trying to get a glimpse of life on
Narn, Alisa peers into Na'Toth's mind, and is repulsed; it's cold, alien.
Franklin suggests that she take that into account while she considers
the offer.
<p>
<img align=middle src="/lurk/gif/017/natoth.gif"> Na'Toth makes her offer.
<p>
Dr. Franklin reports to Garibaldi that analysis of the pak'ma'ras' stomach
contents was negative; they hadn't dined on Minbari lately.
<p>
Neroon, furious that Garibaldi is wasting his time pumping alien stomachs,
threatens to have his ship tear the station apart if Garibaldi can't solve
the mystery.
<p>
Tests reveal that Alisa is at least a P10, which she jokes will probably
make her worth more to the Narn.  Ivanova warns Alisa against accepting
the Narn offer, citing evidence that the Narn keep aliens as slaves and
are likely to do so to Alisa once she's in their clutches.  Talia once
again suggests the Psi-Corps, provoking a heated argument with Ivanova;
Alisa breaks in and says she wants to know <em>all</em> her options.
<p>
Ivanova takes Alisa to visit Delenn, who describes Minbari telepaths.  Psi
ability among the Minbari is considered a rare gift, and those who have it
lead lives of public service, helping people who need their talents.  In
return, the Minbari people provide for all the psis' needs.  While Delenn
speaks, Alisa peers into her mind, and to her shock sees a vision of
white-robed Minbari stunning the guards in front of Branmer's coffin, then
opening the lid.  Alisa flees Delenn's quarters; Delenn can clearly feel
that she was being scanned.  Alisa tells Ivanova that Delenn knows what
happened to the body.

<p>
Sinclair enters his quarters to find them a shambles.  He's attacked from
behind by Neroon.  The two of them scuffle; Neroon claims that he wanted
to search the one place that would be strictly off-limits.  But Garibaldi,
arriving with Alisa in tow, claims he searched Sinclair's quarters with
Delenn observing, and ushers Neroon away.  Alisa tells Sinclair what she
saw in Delenn's mind.
<p>
Delenn and an aide are packing something into a cargo container when
Sinclair bursts into the cargo area.  It's an urn, containing Branmer's
ashes.
<p>
Delenn claims that she's honoring Branmer's wishes; he asked for a simple
ceremony, and wouldn't want his body paraded around as a symbol of war.
She had planned to pass the disappearance off as a miracle, a transformation
of Branmer's body so that he could take his place among the gods.  Now
Sinclair and Garibaldi are in a difficult position, since they've promised
to tell Neroon the results of their investigation.  Delenn offers a
compromise: Neroon will be told the truth, but <em>she</em> will tell him.
<p>
Neroon is furious when he learns what happened.  He vows to lead a protest
personally.  Delenn stops him cold, claiming that if he contradicts her
claim of transformation, the Star Riders will be destroyed, dishonored,
by the Grey Council, whose opinion she claims to represent.  She orders him
to obey her, "just as you obeyed the
order to end the war," and further to apologize to Sinclair.
<p>
Neroon does so, and is surprised when Sinclair offers to pay tribute to
Branmer's courage and skill in a personal message to the Minbari people.
"Perhaps there was some small wisdom in letting your people live," Neroon
says.  "We like to think so," replies Sinclair.
<p>
<img align=middle src="/lurk/gif/017/reconcile.gif"> Neroon and Sinclair

<p>
Sinclair and Delenn are talking in the stone garden when Alisa arrives and
announces that she's going to live with the Minbari.  Delenn claims that
Alisa will help increase the understanding and communication between
humans and Minbari.  Sinclair agrees.
<p>
Alisa bids Ivanova and Talia an emotional farewell.  Talia doesn't agree
with her decision, but admits that Sinclair is right; Alisa's presence
among the Minbari will benefit both peoples.
<p>
Sinclair meets up with Alisa on her way aboard the Minbari ship, and asks
her if she saw anything else in Delenn's mind.  Alisa responds that there
was one other thing, a word, "chrysalis."  "She shut down real fast when
I touched that," Alisa says.  She boards the cruiser, leaving Sinclair to
ponder the significance of the word.
