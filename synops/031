<h3>Synopsis by Matthew Murray (i9717029@unicorn.it.wsu.edu)</h3>

<p>
On Centauri Prime, the Centauri emperor prepares for his voyage off the
homeworld.  His prime minister plans to go with him -- citing the
emperor's poor health -- but the emperor
declines; the prime minister is next in line of authority and needs
to remain behind in case of a crisis.
"What I must do," the emperor explains, "cannot wait
any longer."  Before the emperor leaves, he tells the prime minister
how much he appreciates him, and that he seldom shows the gratitude he
should.  Followed by four veiled Centauri women, the emperor leaves the
throne room.

<p>
Ambassador G'Kar attempts to convince Captain Sheridan that inviting
the Centauri emperor to Babylon 5 is unacceptable to the Narns, because
of what his family did to them.  Sheridan tries to tell G'Kar that
this emperor has gone out of his way to be nice to the Narns, but G'kar
dismisses it as a technicality.  Sheridan tells G'Kar that the
resentment the Narn have against the Centauri is not his problem, and
that everyone is welcome aboard the station, including the emperor.
Sheridan tells G'Kar that he should use the opportunity to open a
dialogue with the emperor, but G'Kar refuses to listen.  As he leaves,
Sheridan tells him not to do something he will regret.  "It's too late
for that, Captain.  Too late by far."

<p>
A group of Centauri ships come through the jump gate as a frequent
visitor to Babylon 5 over the last several months arrives on the
station.  The guard asks him if there is anything he can do to assist,
but as soon as the man sees Garibaldi, he replies that he's found what
he's looking for, and leaves.

<p>
Londo meets with Refa, who details what Londo is to do when he meets
with the Centauri emperor.  Londo is to deliver a carefully planned
speech, which discusses the decline of the Centauri government and the
need for change, and contains several predictions about the economy and the
military that Refa has already arranged to come to pass.  Refa's plan
is to make the emperor look weak and short-sighted.  Though Londo
realizes this will not endear him to the emperor and his court, Refa
explains that the emperor's health is very poor, and he is not
expected to live much longer.  Refa tells Londo that, if they don't
take the opportunity that now presents itself, they may not be in
the proper position when the time comes.  Refa leaves Londo to study
the speech.  Vir, who had been watching the proceedings, is made
uncomfortable by the situation, and tells Londo so when he asks.
"Then, for once," says Londo, "we have something in common."

<p>
The emperor's ship arrives and docks.  The command crew of Babylon 5, in
full dress, is in the docking bay to meet him.  The emperor offers
Sheridan the hands of friendship, which Sheridan accepts.  After
introductions are complete, the emperor tells him that he is very
impressed with their choice to risk great dangers in order to achieve
peace.  Sheridan offers to begin the tour, but the emperor interrupts,
asking Dr. Franklin about Ambassador Kosh, as he has never seen a
Vorlon before.  He is curious because the Centauri have sent many
expeditions into Vorlon space, but none have returned, and he wants to
know more about the stories he has heard.

<p>

<p>
G'Kar is communicating with Karmok, a Narn government official, who
tells him that the Ka-Ri endorsed G'Kar's plans.  G'Kar asks when the
best time would be to perform the act, and Karmok tells him that he
should do it at the reception.  Karmok asks if G'Kar is sure he wants
to do it, but G'Kar insists he is.  "It is a strange feeling, Karmok,
to know suddenly that all the decisions in your life have brought you
to this place.  There is no longer doubt or uncertainty.  The future
now consists of only three probablities."  He opens a box sitting
nearby, and removes a shiny dagger from within.  "In the moment that I
strike, the emperor and I will both die.  Or, he will die and I will
spend my life in prison.  Or, I will fail and be killed.  For the first
time in my life, the path is clear."

<p>
Sheridan joins the emperor in an observation dome.
The emperor asks why Sheridan decided to join
EarthForce.  Sheridan says that it was his choice, that he joined
before war, when a draft was instated.  Sheridan says that he
wanted to make a difference, and asks why the emperor is so
interested.  The emperor responds by saying he never made a choice in
his life because all of his actions had been predetermined, and that he
never thought he had to choose otherwise.  He wonders what may
have happened had he done so.

<p>
Sheridan offers his perspective.  "That's why my father taught me to live
each second as though it were the last moment of my life.  If you love,
love without reservation.  If you fight, fight without fear.  He called
it the way of the warrior."  Sheridan admits that he has only a few
regrets, but the emperor says he has many more, and that he has lost
and forgotten most of his life.  The emperor says, even though most of
his life has slipped away, and most of his options are gone, there
still is the opportunity to do something that can make a difference,
and he will not let it slip by.  Meanwhile, the man who arrived aboard
Babylon 5 earlier is standing in the corridor, watching and listening
as Garibaldi makes security plans for the emperor's reception.

<p>
As the reception for the emperor begins, G'Kar is in his quarters,
preparing for the task which lies before him.  "I take this action," he
dictates into a machine, "without the knowledge or permission of my
government.  Neither should my aide, Na'Toth, be held accountable for
my actions.  The responsibility is mine alone.  I ask that my remains
and my personal property be sent back to Narn--to my family.  My copy
of the Book of G'Quan I leave to Na'Toth, with the hope of her eventual
enlightenment."

<p>
<img align=middle width=128 height=96
src="/lurk/gif/031/gkar-will.gif"> G'Kar makes out his will.

<p>
At the reception, Sheridan asks Ivanova about the veiled Centauri women
who follow the emperor around.  Ivanova explains that they are
telepaths, always linked to the emperor.  Two go with him at all times,
and two remain at home at all times.  Since all four can see and hear
what the others see and hear, the emperor can be kept apprised of what
is going on at home, while his court can learn what he is doing
abroad.  Ivanova asks Sheridan if he knows what the emperor's important
speech is about.  Sheridan tells her that he doesn't know, and that he
hoped it would bring Ambassador Kosh to the reception, but Kosh is not
present.  One visitor they did not expect to see, however, G'Kar,
arrives and promises Sheridan that he will listen to the emperor.

<p>
Nearby, the man following Garibaldi is finally captured.  Garibaldi
demands to know why he has been following him.  He says he needs to talk
to Garibaldi, but before he has a
chance to explain, several other security guards arrive.  Though
pressed to say something, the man remains silent and is taken away by
the guards.

<p>
<img align=middle width=128 height=96
src="/lurk/gif/031/stranger.gif"> "I need to talk to you."

<p>
The emperor and his train proceed to the reception, and G'Kar prepares
the dagger he has brought along.  Delenn sees this, but G'Kar moves away
as she walks toward him.  In a corridor, as the emperor walks, his face suddenly
contorts and he clutches his chest as he falls.  The Centauri with him,
including the telepaths, turn in alarm.  Dr. Franklin rushes out of
the reception to help.  On the Centauri homeworld, the remaining two
telepaths enter the throne room and approach the prime minister, who is
talking with two Minbari, and another gentleman who appears to be
human.  The prime minister rises in alarm, as if he knows what has happened
aboard Babylon 5.

<p>
In MedLab, Dr. Franklin is alone with the bedridden emperor, who gives him an
important message to deliver, something that can't be entrusted to another
Centauri.

<p>
Londo and Vir meet with Refa again.  Refa tells Londo that their
competitors are preparing to take power as soon as the emperor dies.
But Refa wants to prevent that.  He tells Londo that they need to do
something extraordinary, something to assure their side gains power.
Londo remembers something Morden told him long ago.  "He said, 'Just
pick a target...'"  Refa asks Londo what he means, and Londo explains.
"I believe there is a Narn colony on the border of Centauri space,
quadrant 14."  The very mention of this makes Vir uneasy, but Londo and
Refa brush it off.  Refa tells Londo that the colony is a listening
post the Narns have used for many years to spy on them, but that the
planet should be ours.  "Well then," Londo says, "let us take it
back!"  Refa claims it would require a major assault, costing many
lives, but Londo says that he will take care of it, and tells Refa
to send some Centauri military vessels to quadrant 14.  Refa doesn't
see how that will help, but Londo says it will be enough.  Refa, though
still unconvinced, tells Londo that he will see to it, and leaves.
Londo turns to Vir.  "Find Mr. Morden.  Bring him here."  Vir begs
Londo to reconsider his actions, and to just listen to him this once.
He tries to tell Londo that once he does this, he cannot turn back.
Londo claims that he has no choice, and then tells Vir that, if he does
not find Morden, he will do so himself.

<p>
<img align=middle width=128 height=96
src="/lurk/gif/031/londo-refa.gif"> "Let us take it back!"

<p>
"No.  No, I'll go," says Vir.  "I'll go, and I'll bring him back.  And some
day I'm
going to remind you of this conversation.  And maybe then...then you'll
understand."

<p>
"I understand... just fine," Londo says.  "By this time tomorrow, we
will be at war with the Narns.  May the Great Maker forgive me."

<p>
G'Kar is in his quarters, again speaking with Karmok, telling him how
upset he is that he didn't get a chance to assassinate the emperor.
His door chimes; it's Dr. Franklin.
G'Kar tells Karmok that he may soon have another opportunity, and
quickly cuts off the communication.  He lets Dr. Franklin in.
Franklin tells
him that he just saw the emperor.  G'Kar asks how the emperor is, and tells
Franklin he was anxious to meet him.  Franklin tells him that the emperor had a
message for him.  At first, G'Kar doesn't want to hear the message, but
he changes his mind when Franklin says, "He wanted to say
he's sorry."  Franklin continues.  "He came all the way out here, risked
his health, and endangered his life, so that he could stand beside a
Narn in neutral territory and apologize for all the things the Centauri
have done to your people.  For all the things his family did.  He said,
'We were wrong.  The hatred between our people can never end until
someone is willing to say, I'm sorry, and try to find a way to make
things right again, to atone for our actions.'  He said it was the only
choice he ever made in his life, and now that seems to have been taken
away from him."  This news strikes G'Kar deeply, and he says he had no
idea that the emperor had come for that reason.  "No, I'm sure you
didn't," answers Franklin.  "Maybe that's the biggest tragedy of the whole
damn story."

<p>
Londo is asleep.  As he is dreaming, he hears himself say, "Keep this
up, G'Kar, and soon you won't have a planet to protect!"  He sees a
contigent of Narn fighters destroying the space station at Ragesh 3.  Within
seconds, that dissolves, and...

<p>
...He sees a great, fiery star with a hand emerging from it, reaching
toward something...

<p>
...He sees Centauri Prime from orbit...

<p>
...He finds himself standing on the dusty or sandy surface of a planet,
shielding his eyes from the
sun as a group of Shadow ships fly overhead...

crown is placed upon his head...

<p>
<img align=middle width=128 height=96
src="/lurk/gif/031/dream3.gif">

<p>
...He sits on a large throne, dressed in elaborate white clothes.  He
is aged, decrepit, and ill.  Surveying
his surroundings, he sees a Narn, his face aged and wrinkled,
wrapped in a dark cloth.  It is G'Kar...

<p>

<img align=middle width=128 height=96

<p>
...Londo once again sees the great hand, stretching further and further
from the star, grasping at something...

<p>
...He is back in the throne room, in a struggle with G'Kar.  They are
both trying to strangle
   each other.  Londo begins losing the struggle, and he begins to fall
   back, as...

<p>
...he wakes up.  He is quite disoriented, and picks up a small clock
nearby, to check the
time.  "It has begun," he says.

<p>
At the Narn colony in quadrant 14, all is quiet as several Narn ships
patrol the area.  Without warning, three Shadow ships appear and begin
firing at the Narn ships.  The Narns put up a valiant fight, but can
seemingly not even scratch the defenses of the enemy.  The Shadow
ships move toward the planet, destroying everything, and anything, in
their way.  The smaller Narn ships are all destroyed attempting to
protect the planet.  As the three Shadow ships arrive near the planet,
a fourth appears and helps the others attack the colony on the planet,
and the station orbiting it.  After all has been destroyed, the four
ships leave the vicinity, vanishing as they do so.

<p>
Refa and Londo are walking through Babylon 5.  Londo tells Refa that
the Narn will be learning of what happened soon enough, and that
Centauri forces can move in at any time.  Refa says that he will have
to move quickly as well, as he has something to take care of at home.
He tells Londo it is an obstacle that must be removed, but he refuses
to elaborate when Londo asks what it is.  Refa leaves as G'Kar appears
and addresses Londo in a threatening tone.  Londo tries to explain, but
before he has a chance to explain or escape, G'Kar drops the gruff
facade and pulls Londo over to a nearby bar, where he buys him a
drink.  "I've heard something that makes me think there is still hope
for us after all," G'Kar tells him.  "I believed your people capable of
only murder and pain.  But, apparently, there is still a spark of
decency in your genetic code.  It's not much of a foundation, I'll
grant you that, but it's a start!"  The drinks arrive and they toast.
"I never thought I would be saying this Mollari, but, to the health of
your emperor.  And, perhaps, to your health as well."  Londo painfully
accepts the toast, and thanks G'Kar, visibly shaken.  They both drink.

<p>
Several large Centauri warships create a jump point and emerge near
the destroyed colony
just as several smaller Narn ships arrive and see the damage
that has been done.  They do not know what happened, but they quickly
see the Centauri ships there.  The Narn communicate this to the
homeworld and prepare to attack the Centauri warships.  The fighting
begins, and several of the Narn ships are destroyed.

<p>
<img align=middle width=128 height=96
src="/lurk/gif/031/battle.gif"> The battle is joined.

<p>
The Centauri prime minister stands quietly near the throne on Centauri
Prime, thinking.  He begins to walk away, but is stopped by four
Centauri as he attempts to leave.  They say nothing.  The prime
minister tries to call his guards, but before he can, one of the four
thrusts a dagger deep into him, and he falls to the floor, dead.

<p>
Garibaldi is in his office, exhausted, when another security officer
enters, telling him that the prisoner wants to speak with him.
Garibaldi refuses at first, but the officer says the prisoner claims it's
important.  The prisoner enters.  Garibaldi tells him that he has
five minutes, and the man explains.  "I was sent to find you.  I have a
message for you."  He puts a data crystal on Garibaldi's desk.  "I
believe it will explain everything."  Garibaldi is reluctant at first,
but he puts the crystal into his player and starts it.

<p>
The screens light up, showing the face of Ambassador Jeffrey Sinclair.
"Hello, old friend," Sinclair says.  "It's been a while.  I'm trusting
this message to an associate of mine who is sworn to bring it to you at
any cost--including his own life.  My job on the Minbari homeworld is
more than just representing Earth.  The President doesn't know about
that part yet, and...I don't think it would be wise of you to tell
him.  There's a great darkness coming, Michael.  Some of the Minbari
have been waiting for it a long time."

<p>
In C&C, Ivanova reports to Sheridan that they intercepted an open
message sent from the Narn homeworld to G'Kar, reporting about the
assault on the Narn colony in quadrant 14.  This upsets and angers
Sheridan greatly.

<p>
"The bearer of this message," Sinclair continues, "is one of my
rangers.  Some are Minbari.  Most are humans.  They have been drawn
here to learn to work together and prepare for the fight ahead."
Garibaldi pauses the message, and the ranger explains that they have
been on Babylon 5 for nearly two months.  He says they are an army, and
that they are growing.  Garibaldi asks if this army's weapons are coming
through the station, and the ranger says no, but that they do have
friends, and that he can say no more.  Garibaldi continues the
message.  "Their job, for now, is to patrol the frontier, to listen, to
watch, and to return with reports too sensitive to trust to regular
channels.  They are my eyes and ears.  Where you see them, you see me."

<p>
<img align=middle width=128 height=96
src="/lurk/gif/031/ranger.gif"> The ranger watches the message.

<p>
Karmok reports to G'Kar that the Narn ships they sent saw the Centauri
warships lead the assault.  G'Kar asks what happened to the inhabitants
of the colony.  Karmok tells him that most died within the first few
minutes of the attack, but that, if there are survivors, they are
probably going to be enslaved by the Centauri forever, now that they
are in control.  Karmok quickly breaks off the communication, wondering
how the Centauri were able to so easily break through their defenses.
G'Kar turns away slowly from the monitor, shaking his fist in rage.  "I
reached out my hand, and he betrayed me.  He <em>knew!  And he betrayed
me!</em>"  He flings his arm across a nearby table, throwing everything on
the table onto the floor.  His rage growing, he wrenches the table from
its legs and the throws it to the ground, where it breaks in two.

<p>
"In the name of our friendship," Sinclair concludes, "I ask that you
give them every courtesy and cooperation.  I wish I could tell you
more...I wish I could warn you.  But the others don't think it's time
yet.  Stay close to the Vorlon, and watch out for shadows.  They
move when you're not looking."  The message ends, and as
Garibaldi turns to the ranger, he receives a call on his commlink
telling him that help is needed in the ambassadorial wing.  The
communication suddenly breaks off.

<p>
G'Kar bursts down the hall, his eyes burning.  He knocks to the ground
everyone who gets in his way.  His voice filled with anger, he
shouts, "Mollari!  <em>Mollari!</em>"  Sheridan and several security guards
intercept him.  Sheridan tells him that, if he returns to his quarters,
they will not press charges.  G'Kar pleads.  "They're doing it to us again.
Step
aside, Sheridan.  I won't let this happen.  <em>Not again!</em>"

<p>
<img align=middle width=150 height=112
src="/lurk/gif/031/again.gif"> "They're doing it to us again."

<p>
Sheridan
offers to help G'Kar, but warns him that, should he
attempt to attack Londo, he will either be killed or sent off the
station, and that he can't help the other Narns either way.  G'Kar
shouts that the Centauri will kill everyone unless he does something.
Sheridan tells him to decide what is more important: getting revenge
against Londo, or saving the lives of many Narns.  Making his decision,
G'Kar gathers up all his energy for one final strike.  The security
guards prepare to fire if necessary, but G'Kar slams into a wall and
falls down beside it.  Sheridan and the other security guards leave him
alone, in pain, to think.

<p>
<img align=middle width=128 height=96
src="/lurk/gif/031/alone.gif"> Defeat.

<p>
In MedLab, the Centauri emperor tries to speak to Franklin, but
Franklin tells him to take it easy and save his strength.  Franklin
asks if there is anything he can do to help, and the emperor tells him
that he very much wanted to see a Vorlon.  Dr. Franklin smiles and steps
aside.  The emperor turns his head, but seconds later, his face is
covered by a shadow.  He looks up to see Ambassador Kosh standing over
his bed.  "How will this end?" the emperor asks.

<p>
"In fire," Kosh intones.

<p>
Garibaldi tells Sheridan and Ivanova what he learned, but does not
reveal the source.  Ivanova asks him why he believes he can trust
whoever told him this, and Garibaldi says that the source comes
"highly recommended."  Sheridan asks Garibaldi why he is holding
something back, and Garibaldi tells him that he made a
promise.  Sheridan has a hard time accepting the information Garibaldi
presents, and threatens to order Garibaldi to talk, but Garibaldi
refuses, knowing that, if he did so, Sheridan would not be able to
trust him again, because someone higher in the chain of command than
Sheridan could order him to talk as well.  Sheridan accepts this, and
Garibaldi continues.  "Ever since New Years, we've been hearing about
some other major race on the prowl.  My source tells me the rumors are
true, and there may be some link to the Centauri government.  Now, who
or what that link is, I don't know, but they're definitely getting
support."

<p>
"And you think this other race was behind the assault on quadrant 14?"
asks Ivanova.

<p>
"It's possible," replies Garibaldi.

<p>
Sheridan tells them that, if that is true, their enemy wouldn't want
anyone else to know.  Ivanova tells him that all they have is
supposition, but Sheridan says it is a good idea to make your opponent
think you know more than you actually do.  "Now, if your source is
right, we may be able to play a bluff," Sheridan tells Garibaldi.

<p>
In MedLab, Refa, Londo, and the emperor's entourage stand around the
emperor's bed.  Refa tells the emperor that they retook the Narn colony
and that not one Centauri was hurt or killed in doing so.  Their
homeworld is rejoicing, and the Centauri are powerful again, but he
wants the emperor's blessing.  He leans in close, but the
emperor tells him nothing.  The emperor points to Londo, who leans
in.  The emperor whispers something to him, then
dies.  Refa asks what the emperor said, and Londo tells him, "He said,
'Continue.  Take my people back...to the stars.'"  The two Centauri
telepaths, who had been watching, look at each other and then walk
away.  Londo and Refa follow, but Refa stops Londo in the hall, asking
him what the emperor really said.  "He said," Londo answers, with great
difficulty, "that we are both damned."

<p>
<img align=middle width=128 height=96
src="/lurk/gif/031/dying.gif"> The Emperor lies dying.

<p>
"Well," Refa tells him, "it's a small enough price to pay for
immortality."  Laughing, he walks away, leaving Londo alone in the
hall.

<p>
G'Kar is back in his quarters, facing the wall, when the door opens and
Sheridan enters.  He tells G'Kar that he thinks he knows how Earth may
be able to help, and that he has called a council meeting to discuss recent
events.  As Sheridan leaves, G'Kar tells him that he will attend the
meeting.  "Thank you...  for stopping me."

<p>
<img align=middle width=128 height=96
src="/lurk/gif/031/thanks.gif"> "Thank you..."

<p>
At the council meeting, Sheridan addresses Londo, asking what will
happen to the Narn civilians on the colony.  Londo says the Centauri can't allow
them to return to the Narn homeworld, but says that he is sure his
government will find them something productive to do.  Delenn tells him she
thinks he means forced slavery, but Londo claims they have no desire to
misuse anyone.  G'Kar enters, and takes his seat at the council table.
Sheridan tells Londo that he has received permission from Earth to send
observers to the colony to check on the civilians, to make sure they
aren't mistreated.  Londo tells Sheridan the observers are not welcome, but
Sheridan doesn't care.  He tells Londo he shouldn't try shooting down
an EarthForce ship; though Earth isn't looking for another war,
it will shoot back if fired upon.  Sheridan tells Londo that the observers
will check on the survivors and put together a full report, including
as much as they can learn about how the colony was so easily defeated.
This disturbs Londo, who tells the council that he thinks he can convince the
Centauri government to allow the civilians to return to the Narn
homeworld, as long as no observers are sent to the colony.  Sheridan
agrees, and tells him, "I'm sure your gesture of goodwill will be
appreciated for what it is...Ambassador."  Delenn asks G'Kar to
speak.

<p>
"Before coming here," G'Kar says,  "I received a communique from my
government.  For a hundred years, the Centauri occupied our
world.  Devestated it.  We swore we would never let that happen again.
This attack on our largest civilian colony has inflicted terrible
damage and loss of life.  They've crossed a line we cannot allow them
to cross.  As a result, two hours ago my government officially declared
war against the Centauri Republic.  Our hope for peace is over.  We are
now at war...we are now at war."

<p>
Refa tells Londo and Vir that the death of the Centauri prime minister
changed the balance of power on the Centauri homeworld, neutralizing
the other powerful families, and leaving the emperor's nephew, who is
on the side of Londo and Refa, the successor to the throne.  Refa
tries to give his cup to Vir, who just glares at him.  Refa continues.
"For the first time in a
hundred years, Ambassador, our people are on the right track again, and
we have you to thank for it.  You will find the emperor's
gratitude...most rewarding."  Refa bids them farewell and leaves.

<p>
<img align=middle width=128 height=96
src="/lurk/gif/031/success.gif"> "Our people are on the right track again."

<p>
"I'm surprised," Vir tells Londo after Refa leaves.  "You could have
asked to be named to the royal court.  It would have put you in a
position to become emperor yourself one day.  That's what you want,
isn't it?"

<p>
Londo thinks back, recalling his recent dream of being crowned and
then, many years later, being strangled by G'Kar.  "No.  I have no
desire to be emperor," he tells Vir.  "I prefer to work behind the
scenes.  The reward is nearly as great, and the risk far, far less."

<p>
Garibaldi thanks the ranger for his help in saving the lives of so
many Narns.  When the ranger asks if Garibaldi will give the
cooperation he needs, Garibaldi agrees, as long as the ranger keeps him
informed of what the rangers learn, both here and abroad.  The ranger
says he will, as long as their presence is kept a secret.  Garibaldi
agrees to that, but asks one last question.  "Aside from me, does
anybody else know you're here?"

<p>
"Just one other," the ranger says as he walks away.

<p>
Delenn, in her quarters, examines a message crystal in her hands
closely.  She puts it into her player, and is greeted with a voice she,
too, hasn't heard in a long time.  "Hello, old friend..."
