<h3>Synopsis by Matthew Murray (mmurray@wsu.edu)</h3>

<p>
Captain Sheridan is out helping to train Zeta Squadron against the
Centauri, should the need to fight them ever arise.  One of the other
pilots is able
to shoot Lt.  Keffer quite easily, and is about ready to start
again when Sheridan receives a call from Ivanova saying there's an
emergency on Babylon 5.  Sheridan orders Zeta Squadron to continue
practicing the maneuvers and returns to the station.

<p>
Lennier enters the Zocalo where he finds Vir sitting there, nursing a
drink.  Lennier sits down next to him and says to Vir, "Sometimes I get
so close, and yet it seems I'm shut out of the important things."

<p>
<img align=right width=128 height=96 src="/lurk/gif/044/nervous.gif" alt="">
"It's a useless feeling," Vir replies.  "The ambassador is definitely
going through some changes.  He even looks different."

<p>
"Indeed, and now with the military starting to stampede over everyone
and everything..."

<p>
"The coming and going and secret meetings..."

<p>
"You never know what it's all about, until later, when it's too late."

<p>
"They never listen to us."

<p>
"It makes me nervous," they both say at once.

<p>
"Same time tomorrow?" Vir asks.

<p>
"Sure," Lennier replies as he leaves.<br clear=all>

<p>
Sheridan meets up with Ivanova who tells him that the Drazi and
Pak'ma'ra ambassadors are waiting for him in his office with an urgent
matter to discuss.  Sheridan orders that all the fighter squads be put
through extensive training so they will be ready to fight if
necessary.

<p>
<img align=right width=128 height=96 src="/lurk/gif/044/soon.gif" alt="">
Ivanova asks the Pak'ma'ra ambassador if he is certain that he is
correct, and he assures her that he is.  The Drazi ambasador explains
that the Centauri have invaded both of their territories, taken command
of listening posts, and are preparing to attack other races and other
worlds.  "War is spreading," the Drazi says.  "Perhaps soon they even
attack you."

<p>
Sheridan paces back and forth in his office as Ivanova arrives with
Londo.  The conversation is very tense as they discuss the movement of
the Centauri forces.  Sheridan asks why what the Centauri did to the Narn
wasn't enough, but Londo insists that they are merely trying to
stabalize the region, using the conquered worlds as a buffer zone,
though the Drazi and Pak'ma'ra don't agree.  Londo says his people merely
want to establish a presence, and Sheridan demands to know where it
will end.  He tries to convince Londo that the Centauri are at the center
of the trouble, but Londo refuses to listen.  He warns Sheridan not to
overstep his authority, which ends at Babylon 5.

<p>
Garibaldi tells Sheridan that Londo has been acting very differently,
and that he can no longer be talked to or reasoned with.  Sheridan asks
Garibaldi how to get through to Londo, but Garibaldi says it can't be
done as long as Londo is afraid, and that he isn't able to keep up with
the climactic changes occurring all around him.  Sheridan says that he
made a full report to Earthdome, and with the new races involved, Earth
can no longer ignore the problem.  Ivanova calls Sheridan and tells him
that Frederick Lantz, from the Ministry of Peace, has just arrived on
the station, and Sheridan leaves to see him.

<p>
As Keffer and a fellow officer finish their training, they both admit
that they are very tired and wish they knew what was going on with
Sheridan.  The officer suggests it might be the "ghost"--something
several other officers say in hyperspace while returning from sector
14.  She explains that they said it looked like a cross between "a
spider and your worst nightmare."<br clear=all>

<p>
<img align=right width=128 height=96 src="/lurk/gif/044/arrival.gif" alt="">
Sheridan meets up with Lantz, who introduces him to Mr. Welles, the man
in charge of the Nightwatch.  Sheridan introduces them to Ivanova, and
Lantz tells Sheridan that he wants to interview Londo and the
ambassadors of the worlds affected by the Centauri expansion.  Mr.
Welles says that he wants to speak with the members of the Nightwatch
aboard Babylon 5.  Ivanova tells them that she can't believe they came
to Babylon 5 -- she never thought they would.  Lantz explains that
Earth can't sit still forever, but it
is good to know firsthand whether they're about to make the right choice.

<p>
Keffer meets up with another pilot in the Zocalo and asks him about the
ghost he saw.  The officer, Mitch, tries to avoid the subject, but
Keffer is able to provide a flawless description of the ship, telling
him that he saw it as well, but that he wasn't able to record it or get
any other information about it.  Mitch tries to convince Keffer that he
shouldn't try to search for it again.<br clear=all>

<p>
<img align=right width=160 height=120 src="/lurk/gif/044/044-1.gif" alt="">
While discussing the situation with the Drazi and the Pak'ma'ra and
other tidbits of information about Earth with Ivanova,
Lantz explains that he wants
to leave his grandchildren a good legacy, and that is what he hopes to
accomplish by working for the Ministry of Peace.

<p>
On C&C, a jump point is detected opening up on the other side of
Epsilon 3, where it can only be detected by Babylon 5.  It turns out to
be a Narn war cruiser, which hails them.  The captain tells Sheridan that,
when the Centauri attacked the homeworld, his ship was on a deep-space
assignment, but that he hopes that they can help liberate the
homeworld again, and to do that, they need the help and sanctuary of
Babylon 5.<br clear>

<p>
<img align=right width=128 height=96 src="/lurk/gif/044/tea.gif" alt="">
Ivanova is just about to eat when Mr. Welles enters and asks to speak
with her.  He asks her if she is happy, and she tells him that she
supposes she is.  He says he likes to know as much as possible about
the people he works with, and that her record is exemplary, and asks
what her plans for the future are.  She says she's happy on Babylon 5
for now, but isn't sure what the future holds for her; she may
like to captain a starship.  Welles tells her that, with the help of
the Nightwatch, she can get her ship years earlier than she otherwise
might, and he offers to pull
some strings for her if she will help them discover disloyal people and
potentially dangerous problems forming on Babylon 5.  She tells him
that she has learned all about the Nightwatch, and was worried
about what she learned, and that she has no intention of violating her
personal beliefs to advance her career.

<p>
Sheridan informs G'Kar about the Narn war ship, and says that it is
safe for the time being.  G'Kar is happy about the news, and glad that
Sheridan plans to give them sanctuary.  Sheridan tells G'Kar about
Lantz's visit; G'Kar is delighted to hear that Earth is prepared to
take sides, and rushes off to try to meet with Lantz.<br clear>

<p>
<img align=right width=128 height=96 src="/lurk/gif/044/report.gif" alt="">
Mr. Welles addresses the Nightwatch members aboard Babylon 5 and is
pleased with their progress, except that of Zack Allan, who hasn't been
reporting much, such as a shopkeeper's vocal complaints about new import
regulations.  Zack tries to defend himself saying that he didn't see
anything wrong with such talk, but Welles disagrees, saying that this
is precisely the kind of thing they should be informed of.  He tells Zack to be
extremely careful about anything suspicious, no matter how innocent it
may seem.  Zack is still very uncomfortable about the situation, but
admits that the reports about the shopkeeper
are true.  Welles is pleased by this, and tells Zack that he shows
great promise.

<p>
Mitch goes to Keffer and gives him a data crystal containing
information about sensor readings of the Shadow ship that may help
Keffer locate it.  Mitch warns him that he may be risking his own life
by searching for the ship, and that he no longer wants any part of the
mysterious vessel.<br clear>

<p>
<img align=right width=128 height=96 src="/lurk/gif/044/snub.gif" alt="">
Lantz finishes meeting with the last ambassador of the League of
Non-Aligned worlds and prepares to meet with Londo when G'Kar arrives,
asking for five minutes of his time.  Lantz refuses, though G'Kar does
his best to convince him otherwise.

<p>
The captain of the Narn ship tells Sheridan that the repairs are going
slowly due to lack of power.
Sheridan suggests shutting down the jump engines so they can use the
extra energy to assist in repairs, and Sheridan assures the captain
that Babylon 5 will protect them.  Lantz arrives at C&C and asks Sheridan
about conducting fighter exercises against Centauri combat models.
Sheridan tells him that it is true, and Lantz orders him to stop with
the drills.  Lantz also informs them that he has been authorized by
Earth to sign a non-aggression treaty with the Centauri, forming an
Earth-Centauri alliance to keep Earth safe.  "We will, at
last, know peace in our time," Lantz says.

<p>
As Welles walks down the corridor, he is approached by a technician
from C&C who was unable to attend the meeting.  She does, however, have
other information for him.

<p>
<img align=right width=128 height=96 src="/lurk/gif/044/shrapnel.gif" alt="">
Sheridan can't believe the idea of the non-aggression treaty, and
Ivanova agrees; it protects Earth and leaves
the Centauri free to attack other worlds.  Sheridan tells Ivanova that
he no longer feels as proud to be in Earth Force as he once did, and
Ivanova tells him that, as 2260 is nearly upon them, it may be a year
to make the uniform mean something again.  She presents him with a
small wrapped present, for Christmas or Hannukah.  He opens it up and
finds a piece of metal inside that he doesn't recognize.  She tells him
that she located a piece of the Black Star and wanted to give it to him
as a reminder that sometimes it is possible to achieve something others
believe can't be done.  Londo calls Sheridan and tells him that he
has learned that Babylon 5 is hiding a Narn warship and orders the ship
and crew turned over to the Centauri.  Sheridan ends the transmission
and wants to know how Londo found out about it, and Ivanova suggests it
was the Nightwatch that was responsible.  The two of them rush
back to C&C.

<p>
Sheridan orders a channel opened up to the Narn ship and tells the
captain that the Centauri know they are there.
A jump point opens and a Centauri battle cruiser
arrives, blocking the Narn ship from fleeing through Babylon 5's jump gate.
Sheridan, who promised G'Kar he'd do whatever he could, sends out Zeta
Squadron to escort the Narn ship.  Lantz arrives at C&C and asks
Sheridan to explain his actions.  Sheridan tells him that he promised
Sanctuary to the Narn ship and will do whatever he can to keep that promise.
Lantz tries to protest Sheridan's actions, but Sheridan has him taken
out of C&C as Zeta Squadron launches.  He opens up a line with Londo
and tells him that the Narn ship will be granted free passage.
Sheridan tells Londo that, if the
Centauri opens fire on the Starfuries, Babylon 5 will respond with
deadly force.  He sends a copy of the transmission to the Centauri
cruiser and orders the defense grid activated.<br clear=all>

<p>
<img align=right width=128 height=96 src="/lurk/gif/044/slice.gif" alt="">
With the Starfuries in position, the Narn ship begins to move toward
the jumpgate.  The Centauri cruiser changes its position, opens its gun
ports, and targets the Narn ship, Zeta Squadron, and Babylon 5 itself.
Sheridan targets the Centauri warship and tells Keffer to fire if fired
upon.  The Centauri lock onto Babylon 5, but Sheridan refuses to fire
until the Centauri do, which happens after only a few seconds.
Sheridan fires interceptor shots and continues to defend Babylon 5
and the Narn ship as it is escorted toward the jump point.  Babylon 5
is hit a couple of times, and Sheridan orders all weapons fired
on the Centauri ship.  The Narn ship
makes it through the jump point; the Centauri ship, severely damaged
by the station's attack, explodes.

<p>
Lantz tells Sheridan that the Centauri are extremely upset over
Sheridan's actions, and despite the fact that morally and legally
Sheridan made the correct choice, Lantz refuses to accept Sheridan's
actions.  Lantz tells Sheridan that the Centauri have accused them of
moving out of neutrality and into a pro-Narn position.  Welles tells
Lantz and Sheridan that the joint chiefs agreed with Sheridan's
actions, which were in accordance with Earth Force regulations, though,
had Sheridan informed them of the Narn warship earlier, things may have
turned out differently.  Lantz tells
Sheridan that the Centauri are willing to drop the entire thing if
Sheridan apologizes.  Sheridan is outraged at this, though Welles tells
him that he has been ordered by the president himself, and that, should
Sheridan go against those orders, he would be removed from command of Babylon
5.  Welles explains that a meeting among all the ambassadors has been
set up in the Zen Garden.

<p>
Zeta Squadron sticks with the Narn warship until Keffer's ship's
computer informs him that there is an elevation in neutrino levels -- one
of the signals from Mitch's data crystal.  Sending the rest of
the squadron and the Narn ship on ahead, Keffer breaks off to
investigate.

<p>
Sheridan, in his dress uniform, practices his apology.  "I
apologize.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry we had to defend ourselves against an
unwarranted attack.  I'm sorry that your crew was stupid enough to fire
on a station filled with a quarter million civilians, including your
own people.  And I'm sorry I waited as long as I did before I blew them
all straight to hell.  As with everything else," he muses, "it's the
thought that counts."  He leaves to go make the speech.

<p>
Keffer,
following the computer signals, finally spies the Shadow ship and
orders the computer to begin recording.<br clear=all>

<p>
<img align=right width=128 height=96 src="/lurk/gif/044/pursuers.gif" alt="">
All the ambassadors and their assistants have gathered in the Zen
garden, waiting for Sheridan's speech as Sheridan makes his way there.
As he approaches the transport tube, he is noticed by two young
Centauri.  In the garden, Ivanova notices that G'Kar has arrived.  She
tells him that he shouldn't be there, and he tells her that he has come
to speak on Sheridan's behalf, and that the League of Non-Aligned
Worlds may listen to him.  Delenn and Kosh move off together to talk
in private.

<p>
Keffer is scanned by the Shadow ship.  He orders
the computer to attach a homing beacon and eject the system record.
The beacon has barely had time to leave the ship when the Shadow vessel
turns toward Keffer, and he is enveloped, screaming, in a blinding
white light.<br clear=all>

<p>
<img align=right width=128 height=96 src="/lurk/gif/044/fall1.gif" alt="">
Sheridan enters the transport tube and finds a place to sit down for
the trip.  When the car arrives at the second transport station,
everyone except Sheridan leaves the car.  When the car recommences its
motion, Sheridan hears a strange noise and notices that an explosive
device has been placed on a seat nearby and is nearly ready to
explode.  Sheridan orders the computer to override and open the shuttle
doors.  He springs out the door and the car explodes behind him.

<p>
The explosion -- and the rapidly falling Sheridan -- capture the attention
of those in the Garden below, but
there is very little time.  "In Valen's name!" Delenn says.

<p>
"Oh my God!"  Ivanova exclaims.  "Emergency alert.  We've got an
explosion in the core shuttle.  We need rescue jetpacks and we need 'em
now."

<p>
"What are you trying to do?"  G'Kar asks.

<p>
"He's more or less weightless," Ivanova explains.  "But the ground is
rotating at sixty miles an hour.  If we can't catch him, he'll be
killed by the impact."

<p>
"You won't have time!" G'Kar offers.

<p>
Delenn turns to Kosh, standing by her in a deserted section of the
garden.  "Kosh, you know what's at stake.  If you are going to do
anything, you must do it now!"  The headpiece of Kosh's encounter suit
opens up, a brilliant blue light shining from within.

<p>
Sheridan continues to fall as Ivanova receives another communication,
saying that the rescue team can't get there for two minutes.  Ivanova
tries to get them to hurry, since they have only thirty seconds.<br clear=all>

<p>
<img align=right width=128 height=96 src="/lurk/gif/044/kosh1.gif" alt="">
Delenn looks up at Kosh as he emerges from his encounter suit.  As Kosh
soars into the air, she recognizes him as a tall, winged Minbari, the
bone on his head carved into the shape of a crown.  He is glowing with
white and yellow light as he flies toward Sheridan.

<p>
Lennier also recognizes him instantly.  "Valeria!" he exclaims.

<p>
The Drazi ambassador sees Kosh as well, but sees him differently.
"Droshalla," he shouts out as he sees a light
ensconced Drazi rise into the air on her wings.<br clear=all>

<p>
<img align=right width=128 height=96 src="/lurk/gif/044/kosh3.gif" alt="">
"G'Lan," G'Kar says breathlessly, referring to the Narn clad in pure
white who is flying up to Sheridan to rescue him.

<p>
Londo looks up as well, puzzled.<br clear=all>

<p>
<img align=right width=128 height=96 src="/lurk/gif/044/kosh5.gif" alt="">
As Sheridan falls, he too sees something different.  A human male, clad
all in white, and outlined by a warm yellow glow against his wings,
holds his hands out to Sheridan, who grasps them.  The figure,
appearing as an angel to Sheridan, helps him to the ground, again in
the secluded part of the garden.  When he arrives, Sheridan is
astounded.  "Kosh?" he asks.  The figure nods.

<p>
Delenn enters Sheridan's quarters.  She was worried about him, but
Sheridan says he is fine.  "The whole station's talking about what
happened.  Every race that was in the garden saw something different...
yet the same.  A being of light."

<p>
"Yes," Delenn affirms.  "Each according to his or her type."

<p>
"But it was Kosh, wasn't it?" Sheridan asks Delenn, and she nods.
"That's what he meant when he said that if he left his encounter suit,
he'd be recognized by...  everybody," Sheridan concludes.

<p>
"For millions of years, the Vorlons have visited other worlds, guided
them and..."

<p>
"Manipulated us?  Programmed us so that... when we saw them, we would
react the right way?"

<p>
"It is, as you say, a matter of perspective," Delenn tells Sheridan
solemnly.  "What matters is that he has revealed himself to those who
understand--you, me...  and those who have been watching.  The Shadows
will know what Kosh has done.  They will worry, afraid that he would
not reveal himself unless the Vorlons were prepared to stand against
them."

<p>
"Are they?"

<p>
"I do not think so.  But as long as the Shadows believe the rest of us
are unaware of their existence, we have time to prepare."

<p>
"Well, let's just hope that nobody find out about them until..."
Sheridan is interrupted by a call from Ivanova saying that Zeta
Squadron has returned, but Keffer has not.

<p>
In the Zocalo, a Narn and Drazi both describe what they saw in the
garden.  The Narn leaves, but the Drazi asks Londo, sitting nearby,
what he saw.  "Nothing," Londo replies.  "I saw...  nothing."  He turns
and leaves.

<p>
Londo shouts angrily in the council chamber as Ivanova, in voiceover,
explains.
"It was the end
of the Earth year 2259, and the war was upon us.  As anticipated, a few
days after the Earth-Centauri treaty was announced, the Centauri
widened their war to include many of the Non-Aligned Worlds.  And there
was another war brewing closer to home, a personal one whose cost would
be higher than any of us could imagine."
The shopkeeper Zack informed on is forced out of his shop, closed by
the Ministry of Peace "pending
allegations of sedition." Ivanova, in her quarters, silently and solemnly
lights her menorah.  "We came to this place because
Babylon 5 was our last, best hope for peace.  By the end of 2259, we
knew that it had failed.  But in so doing, it became something
greater.  As the war expanded, it became our last best hope... for
victory.  Because sometimes, peace is another word for surrender.  And
because secrets have a way of getting out."

<p>
<img align=right width=128 height=96 src="/lurk/gif/044/shadow.gif" alt="">
The image of the Shadow ship, seen from the beacon Keffer sent out
appears as an announcer explains.  "When our ship
encountered a distress beacon attached to an EarthForce recording
device, these images, released exclusively to ISN, were found on that
recording.  Strategic analysts in EarthDome have indicated they don't
know who this new race might be... but promised to find out."  The
Shadow vessel turns toward the camera and fires, reducing the image to
static.
