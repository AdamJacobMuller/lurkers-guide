An ISN Special Report.

<li>
President Clark commited suicide
last night.  Cameras show the Executive Office, a sheet thrown over a body
in a chair with the sign, "Traitor to Earth!" taped to the chest.

<p>
<li>
Meanwhile, Sheridan has surrendered to Earth officials and awaits their
decision on whether to charge him with a crime.  Despite his current
popularity, he still must justify his actions.  There is a shot of Sheridan
seated in a conference room filled with milling Earth Force personnel.

<li>
Acting President Susanna Luchenko, of the Russian Consortium, announced
that the legal system will prosecute those who committed crimes during
Clark's term, and urged people not to take justice into their own hands.

<p>
<li>
ISN sends its prayers to Susan Ivanova, critically wounded on Babylon 5.

</ul>

<p>
Franklin is oblivious to the thrill of captaining a White Star, wishing
only that the journey to B5 were already over, and afraid what
he'll find when he catches up with Marcus.

<br clear=all>
<p>
<img align=right width=128 height=96 alt="" src="/lurk/gif/087/marcus.jpeg">
But it's already too late.  Two medics enter the infirmary and discover
Marcus' still form slumped over Ivanova's braced and bandaged body, both of
them plugged into the alien healing/execution device.  When Franklin
arrives, he is immediately escorted to Ivanova, the medic explaining on the
way that Ivanova seems to be "cured" but Marcus was dead when they found
him.  

<p>
Ivanova is anything but happy to be alive though.  She is curled up in a
medical gown on the floor next to a window where a sheet-covered body can
be seen inside.  She hears someone approach and shouts at him to go away.

<p>
"Susan, it's me," Franklin says quietly, and sits down next to her.

<br clear=all>
<p>
<img align=right width=128 height=96 alt="" src="/lurk/gif/087/crying.jpeg">
Rocking herself and weeping, Susan rails at Marcus for doing this, for
hacking through codes to find out about the device, for breaking all the
rules, and for never asking for anything.  For sacrificing himself for her,
for taking himself from her, and for taking away the chance that she could
love him back.  When she was resigning herself to her death she heard
someone say, "I love you," and wondered, "Is that God?"  Instead of
drifting away however, she was dragged back into her body, and then
realized that Marcus was dying beside her, even as her life began to beat
more strongly.  Incapacitated, she couldn't do a thing to prevent it.

<p>
After so many bad relationships, she was afraid of loving and being hurt
again, but she should have done it anyway, or at least "boffed him once."
When Stephen remarks that "that's one way to deal with unrequited love," she
replies, "All love is unrequited, Stephen.  All of it," and buries her head
in his shoulder.

<p>
Striding impatiently in a docking bay, G'Kar chides Londo for being late.

<p>
"You're early," Londo returns.

<p>
When G'Kar objects that he is "never premature," Londo retaliates, "That's
not what I hear," allowing however that two minutes may well be prodigious
for a Narn.  At this moment, Vir hustles up nervously with something urgent
and secret to tell the Ambassador.  Londo magnanimously offers to give
G'Kar pointers on his problem, and as G'Kar strides off in a huff, Londo
comments that they are "developing a strange relationship.  At times I find
I rather enjoy it."

<br clear=all>
<p>
<img align=right width=128 height=96 alt="" src="/lurk/gif/087/emperor.jpeg">
It appears that the Regent is ill and not expected to live much longer.
The Centauri government has requested Londo to return home to lead them.
When Mollari's expression remains annoyed, Vir explains, "You're going to
be Emperor, Londo!  Isn't that wonderful?"  Vir has no way of knowing that
Londo has dreaded this day more than anticipated it.

<p>
Awaiting his fate in Earth Dome, Sheridan has an unwelcome visitor.  Bester
begins by denying everything about using Garibaldi, William Edgars and a
telepath virus, but admits that the wise course of action would be to
destroy such a virus while keeping the antidote--just in case.  Of course,
he gloats, for a mental scan confirming Garibaldi's story to be valid in
court, the telepath would have to be a member of Psi Corps.  

<p>
Sheridan smiles and replies, "You really think you've got it all covered,
don't you."

<p>
Bester can't contain his real reason for coming any longer.  He wants to
know whether his lover, Carolyn, was one of the telepaths used to disable
the destroyers in the final battle at Mars.  If she was, Bester threatens,
Sheridan won't leave the room alive.

<br clear=all>
<p>
<img align=right width=128 height=96 alt="" src="/lurk/gif/087/bester.jpeg">
The captain scoffs, "Death.  Been there, done that."  Using the telepaths
as weapons was the hardest decision he ever made, he claims.  Only thirty,
single telepaths without families were chosen out of a hundred.  Making the
Psi Cop agonize just a little bit longer, because Carolyn was single and
had no family, Sheridan shouts, "I know what it's like to lose someone,
just to find her and lose her again," and he wouldn't even wish it on
Bester.  Carolyn is still on the station and can be transferred to Earth as
soon as it's safe.

<p>
Bester's bluster drops and he sits weakly.  "Thank you," he says.

<p>
Sheridan's disgust doesn't waver.  He continues that he knows that with
Clark out of power, Bester will have to regroup, but he won't stop trying
to take over the government.  But Sheridan will be watching.  And when
Bester starts a war between the telepaths and the normals someday, he'll
lose.  

<p>
Stung, Bester replies, "We'll see."

<p>
Before he leaves, Sheridan reminds him not to rest too easy because
Garibaldi will be coming after him.  Bester dismisses this, but Sheridan
assures him that whatever Garibaldi does, "it will be creative, colorful,
and extremely unpleasant."

<br clear=all>
<p>
<img align=right width=128 height=96 alt="" src="/lurk/gif/087/bookie.jpeg">
Garibaldi smashes a fat little man's face into a wall.  "Where is she?" he
asks, meaning Lise.  The man denies all knowledge.  Garibaldi flings him
into another wall and explains the situation more clearly.

<p>
Londo and G'Kar find Delenn musing silently.  She congratulates Londo on
his promotion and he barks, "You've heard that already?"  

<p>
"There is little that does not reach me these days."

<br clear=all>
<p>
<img align=right width=128 height=96 alt="" src="/lurk/gif/087/giddy.jpeg">
Before the representatives from the non-aligned worlds arrive, she wants
them to read a proposal, because their support will be critical.  After a
glance, G'Kar asks if she is sure she wants to do this.  Londo reads it and
begins laughing.  Nonplussed, Delenn says it isn't funny.  Londo chortles
that being in the "presence of living history...makes you giddy."  When the
others arrive, he tells them that he hopes they "have all brought a change
of underwear.  You will need it after you read this."

<br clear=all>
<p>
<img align=right width=160 height=120 alt="" src="/lurk/gif/087/inconvenient.jpeg">
Sheridan's patience with being cooped up is exhausted about the same time
it is decided what to do with him.  President Luchenko explains that the
debate was between whether to give him the Medal of Honor or shoot him, or
both.  She criticizes his "inconvenient" military action and political
naivete, but offers that in exchange for amnesty for his crew and allies,
he must resign from Earth Force.  If he refuses, he will be court
martialed.  Sheridan asks for the amnesty in writing and agrees to resign.

<p>
A man enters a warehouse on Mars.  A big guy asks him, "How much do they
want for her alive?"  They jump at a knock at the door.  There's a colorful
package outside.  They open it; it explodes and Rangers drop down from the
rafters as Garibaldi and more Rangers break in the door.  Running through
building, Garibaldi calls, "Lise!" until there is a muffled reply from
behind a door.  He breaks her out and they fall into each other's arms.

<br clear=all>
<p>
<img align=right width=128 height=96 alt="" src="/lurk/gif/087/unrequited.jpeg">
Approaching Earth, Delenn is in a reverie because the Council has approved
her proposal.  "They will talk about this day for a hundred years."
Lennier says he wishes Marcus were here, and then asks with emotion in his
voice if Delenn heard Ivanova's comment about love being unrequited.
Delenn looks deeply at Lennier, touches his face and tells him, "She's
wrong, of course."

<br clear=all>
<p>
<img align=right width=128 height=96 alt="" src="/lurk/gif/087/press.jpeg">
ISN carries the news conference live.  The President graciously introduces
Sheridan and declares that all sides in the recent war fought for Earth.
Explaining it as a conflict between love of Earth and love of duty,
Sheridan announces his resignation in the hopes that the wounds can heal
quickly.

<br clear=all>
<p>
<img align=right width=128 height=96 alt="" src="/lurk/gif/087/whitestars.jpeg">
Then G'Kar rises to announce that the League of Nonaligned Worlds is now
dissolved, and there is a new Alliance instead.  Delenn in turn explains
that Earth is being offered a chance to join in an economic and political
pact.  She describes the common authority that all members have agreed to
recognize.  The mission of the Rangers, she explains, is to protect borders
but not participate in wars, to create the peace, but not enforce it.   As
she speaks, the room shakes as dozens of White Stars jump into the sky
above.  From now on, all member races may contribute to the Ranger ranks,
she adds.

<p>
In a private meeting, President Luchenko asks for something more concrete
than "peace" to convince realists to enter the pact.  Delenn casually
offers artificial gravity.  Luchenko takes the bait and asks who will be in
authority over the new alliance.  Delenn explains that they have a board,
indicating herself, Londo and G'Kar, but they also have an elected
President as well.

<br clear=all>
<p>
<img align=right width=128 height=96 alt="" src="/lurk/gif/087/president.jpeg">
The President has his feet on the table when an Earth Force General bursts
in demanding to know where the letter of amnesty is.  Copies have already
been given to the reporters, Sheridan replies smugly.  As they leave the
room, Delenn appears at the end of the corridor with someone to see him.
It's his father, free and healthy.  They embrace and then Sheridan Sr.
reaches out to Delenn, delighted to welcome her into the family.

<p>
ISN reports that Earth has agreed to enter the Interstellar Alliance.  At
the press gathering, President Sheridan states that as part of the
agreement all member states must recognize the sovereign rights of colony
worlds, and thus, Mars will be granted independence.  

<br clear=all>
<p>
<img align=right width=128 height=96 alt="" src="/lurk/gif/087/bed1.jpeg">
Watching this in bed, Garibaldi and Lise try to put off figuring out what
they are going to do next, but marriage seems to be in the plans.

<p>
Ivanova has been promoted to Captain and has accepted command of a new
Warlock class warship for a yearlong shake-down cruise, ISN continues.

<p>
Sheridan and Delenn were married in a private ceremony on board White
Star 2 while heading back to Babylon 5, the report concludes.

<br clear=all>
<p>
<img align=right width=128 height=96 alt="" src="/lurk/gif/087/eye.jpeg">
Londo shuts the news off.  As G'Kar picks rice off his jacket and pops it
in his mouth, Londo tells him to cut it out.  If it were any good would
they be throwing it at people?  He muses that he'd sure like to see the
newlyweds now.  G'Kar looks distracted, and peering at him Londo demands to
know where his artificial eye is.   It's sitting innocuously on a table,
aimed at the honeymoon bed.
