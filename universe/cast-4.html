<p>
Despite its fantastic setting, <cite>Babylon 5</cite> is at its core a story
about people, about the choices they make and the consequences of those
choices.  <cite>Babylon 5</cite>'s characters are as interesting and varied
as the situations they encounter.

<dl>

<dt>
<img align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/sheridan4.gif" width=80 height=100>
Captain John Sheridan
-
<a href="/lurk/making/cast.html#boxleitner">Bruce Boxleitner</a>
<dd>
The commander of Babylon 5 and, with Delenn, leader of the Army of Light.
Formerly an officer of the Earth Alliance military until Babylon 5's secession,
Sheridan was a hero of the Earth-Minbari War.  He now finds himself at the
center of a storm that dwarfs anything in his experience.
A visit to Z'ha'dum, the Shadow homeworld, resulted
in his death, but he was revived by Lorien, one of the First
Ones.  His sacrifice resulted in the destruction of the Shadows'
largest city and halted their advance.  The experience lent him a heroic
mystique in the eyes of many, a situation which doesn't entirely please him.

<p>
<dt>
<img align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/ivanova4.gif" width=80 height=100>
Commander Susan Ivanova
-
<a href="/lurk/making/cast.html#christian">Claudia Christian</a>
<dd>
Second in command and in charge of the day-to-day operations of Babylon 5,
Ivanova's responsibilities have only increased since the start of the Shadow
War.  A capable pilot and tactician, she can frequently be found in command of
part of the White Star fleet.  Ivanova's natural pessimism, bordering on
fatalism, would be unbearable if not for her dry sense of humor.  Born in
St. Petersburg, Russia, and raised abroad on Earth, Ivanova is a latent
telepath, "not even a P1," and spent her life hiding her talent from
Psi Corps after their legally-mandated drug treatments drove her mother
to suicide.

<p>
<dt>
<img align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/delenn4.gif" width=80 height=100>
Delenn
-
<a href="/lurk/making/cast.html#furlan">Mira Furlan</a>
<dd>
Officially, Delenn is the Minbari Ambassador, a former member of Minbar's
ruling body, the Grey Council.  The Shadow War splintered the Council and
her people; now she leads the Religious and Worker Castes as co-commander
of the Army of Light.  Delenn's strong sense of destiny, her conviction
that her role in the war is a matter of fate, led her to undergo a physical
transformation that gave her human characteristics.  At first, this made her
an outcast, but as the ancient prophecies started coming true, she found
her people rallying around her.  Delenn and Sheridan are in love, but their
relationship is largely on hold thanks to the demands of the war.

<p>
<dt>
<img align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/garibaldi4.gif" width=80 height=100>
Security Chief Michael Garibaldi
-
<a href="/lurk/making/cast.html#doyle">Jerry Doyle</a>
<dd>
Formerly in charge of security on Babylon 5. Though he has a troubled past,
bouncing from position to position and trying to overcome alcoholism, he seems
to have found his home on Babylon 5.  Garibaldi is something of a smart-aleck,
always ready to crack a joke, but given to bouts of self-doubt and
introspection when nobody's looking.  While Sheridan was on Z'ha'dum, Garibaldi
was abducted by the Shadows and brought to a Psi Corps facility; he has no
idea what was done to him there, and only vaguely remembers the abduction
itself.  Since his return he has become short-tempered and skeptical of
Sheridan and his other compatriots.

<p>
<dt>
<img align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/franklin4.gif" width=80 height=100>
Dr. Stephen Franklin
-
<a href="/lurk/making/cast.html#biggs">Richard Biggs</a>
<dd>
Dedicated and assured, a specialist in xenobiology (alien biology), and
in charge of Medlab on Babylon 5. His background is mainly in
experimental medicine, so his bedside manner is occasionally not what
it should be. His strong sense of personal morality is at times in
conflict with his duties as the chief medical provider for aliens from
hundreds of worlds and cultures, some of whom view his obligations
rather differently. Dr. Franklin is known to operate outside the rules
when he feels the issue is important.  He runs a free clinic in the
Downbelow section for those who cannot afford medical care; he also
serves on an "underground railroad" for telepaths who do not want to be
found by the Psi Corps. In his middle thirties now, he spent years
hitchhiking through space, offering his medical services in exchange
for the opportunity to examine new life forms.

<p>
<dt>
<img align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/londo4.gif" width=80 height=100>
Londo Mollari
-
<a href="/lurk/making/cast.html#jurasik">Peter Jurasik</a>
<dd>
The former Centauri ambassador to Babylon 5, Londo was promoted to chief of
planetary security and became a member of the Centauri Royal Court.  Londo
was once a minor figure, a decadent nobleman from an insignificant royal
house.  But his dealings with the Shadows, dealings whose price he didn't
understand until too late, propelled him into the corridors of power and
are likely to make him the next Emperor.  World-weary and horrified by the
events spinning out of control around him, Londo's sarcastic sense of humor
has been all but smothered; he finds himself walking on eggshells, choosing
his words carefully lest they cause even more damage.

<p>
<dt>
<img align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/gkar4.gif" width=80 height=100>
G'Kar
-
<a href="/lurk/making/cast.html#katsulas">Andreas Katsulas</a>
<dd>
The ambassador of the Narn Regime when there was a Narn Regime to represent,
G'Kar is a fugitive, wanted by the Centauri Republic.  Sheridan granted
him asylum on Babylon 5, which G'Kar is using as a base of operations from
which to organize a movement to retake his homeworld from the Centauri.
Thanks to a Vorlon-induced revelation, G'Kar believes that his people
must serve the role of sacrificial lambs, sacrificing themselves in the
interest of the greater good.  He is something of a spiritual leader
among his people; his exile, now well over a year long, has given him a
compelling serenity and sense of conviction.

<dt>
<img align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/kosh4.gif" width=80 height=100>
Ambassador Kosh
-
animatronics
<dd>
Native voice
designed by Chris Franke.<br>
English translation: Ardwight Chamberlain.
<p>
The station's second Vorlon Ambassador after the first was assassinated by
the Shadows, Kosh is a reclusive, dark personality, who seems to hold the
other beings on the station in low esteem, if not contempt.  Like all Vorlons,
in public he wears a bulky encounter suit to hide his true form.  When he
bothers to speak with others at all, he communicates through a complex sequence
of musical tones, translated into English by a device on his encounter suit.
The only person on the station who knows anything about Kosh is his aide
Lyta Alexander, whose body he occasionally inhabits when he wants to travel
incognito.
