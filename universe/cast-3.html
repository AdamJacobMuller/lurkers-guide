Despite its fantastic setting, <cite>Babylon 5</cite> is at its core a story
about people, about the choices they make and the consequences of those
choices.  <cite>Babylon 5</cite>'s characters are as interesting and varied
as the situations they encounter.

<dt>
<img align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/sheridan.gif" width=80 height=100>
Captain John Sheridan
-
<a href="/lurk/making/cast.html#boxleitner">Bruce Boxleitner</a>
<dd>
The commander of Babylon 5 and representative of the Earth Alliance.
One of the few heroes of the Earth-Minbari War, Sheridan scored Earth's only
major victory of the war, something which has earned him the hatred of the
Minbari warrior caste, though since his appointment he has generally gotten
along with the Minbari.  Sheridan leads a cell
of an anti-Government resistance movement aboard Babylon 5.  When he found
out that the Shadows were responsible for the loss of his wife Anna, he
pledged himself to help defeat them.  Along with
Delenn, Sheridan is in charge of the Rangers on Babylon 5.

<p>
<dt>
<img align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/ivanova.gif" width=80 height=100>
Commander Susan Ivanova
-
<a href="/lurk/making/cast.html#christian">Claudia Christian</a>
<dd>
Second in command and in charge of the day-to-day operations of Babylon 5,
Ivanova is an ambitious career officer.  She can be quirky or
pessimistic at times, but she has a dry sense of humor that shows
itself in the rare moments she is able to relax among others. Born in
St. Petersburg, Russia, and raised abroad on Earth, Ivanova is a latent
telepath, "not even a P1," but has spent her life hiding her talent from
Psi Corps after their legally-mandated drug treatments drove her mother
to suicide.

<p>
<dt>
<img align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/garibaldi.gif" width=80 height=100>
Security Chief Michael Garibaldi
-
<a href="/lurk/making/cast.html#doyle">Jerry Doyle</a>
<dd>
In charge of security on Babylon 5. Though he has a troubled past, bouncing
from position to position and trying to overcome alcoholism, he seems to
have found his home on Babylon 5.  Garibaldi is something of a smart-aleck,
always ready to crack a joke, but given to bouts of self-doubt and
introspection when nobody's looking. His natural sense of paranoia wasn't
reduced when he was shot in the back last year by his own second-in-command
while he was investigating the death of President Santiago.  He is working
with Sheridan in the fight against the corruption on Earth.

<p>
<dt>
<img align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/franklin.gif" width=80 height=100>
Dr. Stephen Franklin
-
<a href="/lurk/making/cast.html#biggs">Richard Biggs</a>
<dd>
Dedicated and assured, a specialist in xenobiology (alien biology), and
in charge of Medlab on Babylon 5. His background is mainly in
experimental medicine, so his bedside manner is occasionally not what
it should be. His strong sense of personal morality is at times in
conflict with his duties as the chief medical provider for aliens from
hundreds of worlds and cultures, some of whom view his obligations
rather differently. Dr. Franklin is known to operate outside the rules
when he feel the issue is important.  He runs a free clinic in the
Downbelow section for those who cannot afford medical care; he also
serves on an "underground railroad" for telepaths who do not want to be
found by the Psi Corps. In his middle thirties now, he spent years
hitchhiking through space, offering his medical services in exchange
for the opportunity to examine new life forms.


<p>
<dt>
<img align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/delenn-2.gif" width=80 height=100>
Ambassador Delenn
-
<a href="/lurk/making/cast.html#furlan">Mira Furlan</a>
<dd>
Represents the Minbari. Once a member of Minbar's ruling body, the Grey
Council, she lost her position after her controversial decision, following
a prophecy, to undergo a transformation that gave her human characteristics.
Religious, with a strong sense of fate and justice,
she believes that she is the chosen one, who will lead in the upcoming fight
against the Shadows.

<p>
<dt>
<img align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/londo.gif" width=80 height=100>
Ambassador Londo Mollari
-
<a href="/lurk/making/cast.html#jurasik">Peter Jurasik</a>
<dd>
The representative of the Centauri Republic. Once on an inconsequential
assignment, Londo has become one of his government's most powerful figures
due to a Faustian bargain struck with new "friends" he knew nothing about,
a deal that has spun far out of control.  With their help, and the help of
a few other ambitious Centauri, his government decimated the once
powerful Narn Regime.  Once jovial and indulgent, Londo is now deadly
serious as he comes to realize what the consequences of his association
with the Shadows really are.

<p>
<dt>
<img align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/gkar.gif" width=80 height=100>
G'Kar
-
<a href="/lurk/making/cast.html#katsulas">Andreas Katsulas</a>
<dd>
The ambassador of the Narn Regime when there was a Narn Regime to represent,
G'Kar is now a fugitive, wanted by the Centauri Republic.  Sheridan granted
him asylum on Babylon 5, which G'Kar is using as a base of operations from
which to organize a movement to retake his homeworld from the Centauri.
With limited resources, his authority challenged by the other Narn, G'Kar's
position is truly desperate.  Ironically, he was among the first to realize
that the Shadows were helping the Centauri, but nobody heeded his warnings.
G'Kar is well-read, deeply spiritual, and extremely intelligent.

<p>
<dt>
<img align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/kosh.gif" width=80 height=100>
Ambassador Kosh Naranek
-
animatronics
<dd>
Native voice
designed by Chris Franke.<br>
English translation: Ardwight Chamberlain.
<p>
In order to save Sheridan's Life, Kosh finally has shown himself outside of
his encounter suit, which he would wear even in his own methane-filled
quarters when receiving visitors.  Kosh is still very much an enigma;
to many species, he appears as a holy being of light -- an
angel, for instance.  Kosh has taken a great interest in Sheridan, and is
attempting to train him for the upcoming fight against the Shadows.  He
communicates through a complex sequence of musical tones, translated into
English by a device on his encounter suit. When he speaks, his words are
few and sound cryptic, but often have a strange truth to them.
