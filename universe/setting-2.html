<blockquote><cite>
The Babylon Project was our last, best hope for peace.  A self-contained
world five miles long, located in neutral territory.  A place of commerce
and diplomacy for a quarter of a million humans and aliens.  A shining
beacon in space, all alone in the night.
It was the dawn of the Third Age of Mankind...the year the Great War
came upon us all.  This is the story of the last of the Babylon stations.
The year is 2259.  The name of the place is Babylon 5.
</cite> - Captain Sheridan
</blockquote>

<p>
Babylon 5's mission appears increasingly hopeless.  After nearly two years of
operation, everything is changing for the worse.  Though Babylon 5's mission
of peace continues, war appears to be imminent, and
there is a dangerous new power in the galaxy that few even suspect exists.
Amid the heightening tensions, the complex relationships among the
major powers are shifting in unpredictable ways.

<p>

The <strong>Earth Alliance</strong> is in charge of the station and the
surrounding space.  Its president was recently killed in an "accidental"
explosion.  His successor seems to be taking the goverment in a sinister
direction.  President Clark is connected with the <strong>Psi-Corps,</strong>
an organization responsible
for the tracking and training of human telepaths; increasingly, though, the
Corps appears to be meddling in Earth politics, pursuing its own agenda.
Evidence that the last president's death was not an
accident isn't being taken seriously.  Babylon 5's first commander, Sinclair,
was abruptly removed from his post and sent to the Minbari homeworld.
The new commander, Captain Sheridan, has his work cut out for him; keeping the
peace has never been more difficult.

<br clear>

<p>
<img align=right width=80 height=100 alt="" src="/lurk/gif/chars/lennier.gif">
Once an adversary of Earth, the <strong>Minbari Federation</strong> has
continued to show interest in and friendship with humanity.  Over the past year,
a few have discovered why: the Minbari religious caste believes that
some humans are carrying reincarnated Minbari souls, a discovery they made on
the brink of victory over Earth eleven years earlier.  The abrupt cessation of
the Earth-Minbari War was a direct result; Minbari have a strict moral code
against killing others of their kind.  Minbari are humanoid, bald, with pale
skin and bone crests on their heads.
<br clear>

<p>
<img align=right width=80 height=100 alt="" src="/lurk/gif/chars/londo.gif">
The <strong>Centauri Republic</strong>, long considered a fading empire,
seems to be on the upswing, thanks to a deal that Ambassador Londo Mollari
struck with a mysterious race he knows next to nothing about.
Centauri women are
bald; men wear their hair in peacock-style fans whose length indicates the
wearer's social standing.  The Republic is rife with political intrigue and
backstabbing.

<br clear>
<p>

<img align=right width=80 height=100 alt="" src="/lurk/gif/chars/gkar.gif">
Among those formerly under Centauri domination are the <strong>Narn,</strong>
a reptilian-looking race who fought off their oppressors in a century-long
war of attrition.  The Narn Regime has been building up its military, and it
looks like that preparation may pay off, as the Centauri have gotten
aggressive again and there may be more conflict ahead.  Only Narn Ambassador
G'Kar believes that somebody else is responsible for the Centauri's military
flexing and that more races than the Narn are in danger.


<br clear>
<p>

<img align=right width=80 height=100 alt="" src="/lurk/gif/chars/kosh.gif">
Even though the <strong>Vorlon Empire</strong> has had a representative on
Babylon 5 for a year and a half, almost nothing is known about his race.
Ambassador Kosh seems to be taking an interest in Captain Sheridan, but
Kosh's interest in humans is still shrouded in mystery.  The Vorlons are
an extremely powerful race; no expedition into their space has been
heard from again.  There seems to be some history between the Vorlons and
the Minbari, but neither one is willing to say what it is.

<br clear>
<p>

<img align=right width=80 height=100 alt="" src="/lurk/gif/chars/morden.gif">
The <strong>Shadows</strong> are a strong and dark power who are clearly not
interested in being discovered.  Only those who pay attention to prophecies
suspect they may have returned after a centuries-long absence.
Through their human agent Morden (pictured here) they have offered to help
Londo restore the Centauri Empire's glory... but clearly that's only one step
in their larger plans.

<br clear>
<p>

Much has been resolved since Babylon 5 went online, but many more mysteries
and problems remain.  Who are the Shadows, and what do they want?
What is going on back on Earth, where a new administration seems to be playing
some dangerous games? How will Londo deal with his newfound power as he
moves aggressively to recapture the Centauri Republic's former glory?
Babylon 4 reappeared briefly, in the process of being pulled forward in time by
a future version of Commander Sinclair to act as a base of operations in a
great war; when will that happen, and how will it end?
