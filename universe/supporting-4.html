<h3>Assistants to the Ambassadors</h3>

<dl>

<p>
<dt>
<img width=80 height=100
align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/vir4.gif">
Vir Cotto
-
<a href="/lurk/making/cast.html#furst">Stephen Furst</a>
<dd>
Londo's aide.  Vir feels strongly that the choices Londo has made over
the past year and a half are taking the Centauri down a self-destructive
and morally wrong path, and he's getting less and less shy about expressing
that opinion to Londo.  He feels somewhat powerless in his position, close
to the major decisions but always on the sidelines.

<p>
<dt>
<img width=80 height=100
align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/lennier4.gif">
Lennier
-
<a href="/lurk/making/cast.html#mumy">Bill Mumy</a>
<dd>
Delenn's aide, recently out of a monastery on the Minbari homeworld.  He reveres
Delenn as an almost holy figure and accepts her transformation without
question.  He has pledged his life to her, in fact, and is perfectly willing
to die by her side.  Still something of an innocent thanks to his isolated
upbringing, Lennier has learned some of the art of diplomacy during his tenure
on Babylon 5.

<p>
<dt>
<img width=80 height=100
align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/lyta4.gif">
Lyta Alexander
-
Patricia Tallman
<dd>
A former Psi Corps telepath -- the first one assigned to the station, in
fact.  Three years ago she scanned the Vorlon ambassador, an experience that
left her forever altered, and eventually led to her role as Ambassador Kosh's
aide.  Since the death of the original ambassador, Lyta has been less than
pleased with her job; his successor is clearly less concerned with her
well-being.  But she believes in the rightness of the Vorlon cause, so she
continues to serve.

<h3>Other Characters</h3>

<dl>

<p>
<dt>
<img width=80 height=100
align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/marcus.gif">
Marcus Cole
-
Jason Carter
<dd>
A Ranger permanently stationed on Babylon 5, Marcus is a brave, capable
warrior whose sarcastic wit belies dogged determination and fierce loyalty.
Marcus fights for the Army of Light because he has nothing else left; his
last remaining family was killed in a Shadow attack.  Marcus secretly yearns
for the affection of Commander Ivanova, but so far she seems uninterested.

<p>
<dt>
<img width=80 height=100
align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/zack4.gif">
Zack Allen
-
Jeff Conaway
<dd>
One of Garibaldi's lieutenants, Zack is earnest and trustworthy, if not
necessarily the brightest person on the station.  During Garibaldi's absence,
the job of security chief fell to Zack; the authority seemed to give him
self-confidence, making him more willing to speak his mind.

<p>
<dt>
<img width=80 height=100
align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/theo.gif">
Brother Theodore
-
Louis Turenne
<dd>
A Dominican monk, visiting the station to study the religious beliefs of
alien races.  First appears in
<a href="/lurk/guide/046.html">"Convictions."</a>

<p>
<dt>
<img width=80 height=100
align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/morden.gif">
Morden
-
Ed Wasser
<dd>
A member of the same expedition Sheridan's wife was on, Morden was captured
by the Shadows and works for them.  He is always accompanied by one or two
of them, though they're invisible to most people.
Never a major player, he is always ready to talk to Londo
and pass messages to and from his "associates."  Thanks to Sheridan's
expedition to Z'ha'dum, Morden is now a hideous, scarred figure, who travels
in the shadows and hides his face with a hood and cloak.

<p>
<dt>
Lorien
-
Wayne Alexander
<dd>
The oldest of the surviving First Ones, Lorien lived on Z'ha'dum until
Sheridan's visit.  Lorien is much more than he seems; he can visit one's
dreams and transfer pieces of his vast lifeforce into others.  Lorien is
saddened by the conflict between the Shadows and Vorlons, and is helping
Sheridan put an end to it.  He has introduced a third question to the
two asked by the Shadows and Vorlons: "Why are you here?"  It may prove
to be the question destined to be asked by humanity.

<p>
<dt>
<img width=80 height=100
align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/bester.gif">
Bester
-
Walter Koenig
<dd>
A Psi-Cop, one of an elite unit of the Psi Corps whose function is to track
down rogue telepaths, among other things.  Perhaps in part because of his
P12 psi rating -- more than twice as high as Lyta's -- he seems to have
risen to a position of some importance in the Corps.  Bester opposes the
Shadow influence on the Corps, and is working behind the scenes to help the
Army of Light.

<p>
<dt>
<img width=80 height=100
align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/corwin.gif">
Lt. Corwin
-
Joshua Cox
<dd>
Third in command in C&amp;C, after Sheridan and Ivanova.  Corwin is shy but
well-intentioned, a loyal officer.
