The Babylon Project was our last, best hope for peace.  It failed.

But, in the Year of the Shadow War, it became something greater:  our last,
best hope... for victory.  The year is 2260.  The place: Babylon 5.

<p>
Babylon 5 has failed in its mission.  War has erupted, and is quickly pulling
all the major races in.

<p>
<img align=right width=80 height=100 alt="" src="/lurk/gif/chars/sheridan.gif">
The <strong>Earth Alliance</strong> 
is in charge of the station and the surrounding space.  The corrupt
administration of the EA, led by President Clark, has connections to the
sinister activities of the
<strong>Psi Corps,</strong> a government agency that tracks and trains
human telepaths and increasingly seems to be running the government rather
than serving it.  An Orwellian agency called <strong>Night Watch</strong> is
stifling any signs of dissent, carting people off to be reeducated if they
don't cooperate.  Earth has taken a questionable stance
by allying itself with the expansionist Centauri Empire, hoping to save its
own skin by allowing the Centauri to roll unhindered over the lesser races
Earth once saved.  Babylon 5's commander, Captain Sheridan (pictured here,)
along with a small group, is working to covertly wrestle control away from the
current administration, bolstered by evidence that President Clark was
directly involved in the assassination of his predecessor.

<br clear>

<p>
<img align=right width=80 height=100 alt="" src="/lurk/gif/chars/londo.gif">
The <strong>Centauri Republic</strong>, only months ago a fading empire,
is currently on an expansionist path.
A deal with unknown forces enabled Ambassador Londo Mollari (pictured) to
regain some of their past glory.  It seems only a matter of time, though,
before the deal runs its course and the Centauri find out its price.
In terms of appearance, Centauri appear human at first glance, though that's
deceptive.  Women shave their heads; men wear their hair in fans, with length
indicating social standing.  The Centauri Emperor is a puppet, completely under
the thumb of several royal houses who have risen to ascendancy with Londo's
help.

<br clear>
<p>

<img align=right width=80 height=100 alt="" src="/lurk/gif/chars/gkar.gif">
Once a major power, the <strong>Narn Regime</strong> has been recently
conquered in a brutal assault by the Centauri, especially humiliating since
they were unwilling
subjects of the Centauri Republic of old.  Former ambassador G'Kar, one of
the few who knows that the Centauri aren't working alone, leads a
resistance movement from Babylon 5, but his chances of reclaiming his
homeworld seem slim.  Narns have a reptilian appearance and are easily
provoked.  The strict new rules imposed by the Centauri (including
the death of the killer's family if any Narn kills any Centauri) have forced
them to move carefully.

<br clear>

<p>
<img align=right width=80 height=100 alt="" src="/lurk/gif/chars/lennier.gif">
Once an adversary of Earth, the <strong>Minbari Federation</strong> has
continued to show interest and friendship with humanity,
though how long that will
remain the case is uncertain.  The balance of power in the Minbari ruling body,
the Grey Council, has shifted in favor of the warrior caste, many of whom
are none too happy about the surrender to Earth twelve years earlier.  (Only
the Council and a few outsiders know that the war was ended when the Council
discovered that some humans carry Minbari souls.)  The Minbari have been a
major power for well over a millenium, and were instrumental in the defeat of
the Shadows when they last rose up a thousand years ago.

<br clear>
<p>

<img align=right width=80 height=100 alt="" src="/lurk/gif/chars/kosh.gif">
Very little is known about the <strong>Vorlon Empire</strong>.  The Vorlons
are an ancient race, the last remaining member of a group of elder races known
as the First Ones who ruled the galaxy millions of years ago.  The Vorlons
have visited the lesser races for eons, possibly manipulating many of them
for their own purposes.
The fact that Vorlons appear as holy figures of legend to the few onlookers
who see them outside their encounter suits -- different figures to different
observers, no less -- seems to support that.  The Vorlons are
ancient adversaries of the Shadows, and it's to help wage war against them
one last time that the Vorlons remained behind when the other First Ones
went away.  They are able to project images into people's minds, no doubt
part of the reason for their subjective appearance.

<br clear>
<p>

<img align=right width=80 height=100 alt="" src="/lurk/gif/chars/morden.gif">
The <strong>Shadows</strong> are a dark power, ancient beyond even the Vorlons.
They have fought fierce wars against the First Ones across millions of years.
The last Great War against the Shadows was ten thousand years ago; after that,
perhaps thinking the Shadows destroyed, most of the First Ones departed.  A
thousand years ago the Shadows rose again, and were defeated by an alliance
of the few remaining First Ones and others, including the Minbari.  Now, with
no First Ones other than the Vorlons to oppose them, their victory seems
certain; what their ultimate goals are, nobody knows, except perhaps their
human representative, Morden (pictured.)  The Shadows generally choose to
make themselves invisible, though some can sense their presence anyway.

<br clear>
<p>

<!--img align=right width=80 height=100 alt="" src="/lurk/gif/chars/ranger.gif"-->
The <strong>Rangers</strong> are an underground "army of light" formed to
gather information and perform covert operations in the war against the
Shadows.  Organized with the help of Delenn, Sinclair
(former Babylon 5 commander and current Earth ambassador to Minbar) and
Sheridan, the Rangers have pledged their lives to fight the coming
darkness.  Rangers are identified by a pin which depicts elements of human
and Minbari appearance.

<br clear>
<p>

Babylon 5's original mission of peace may have failed, but it has become
something greater: a chance for victory.  The alliances formed against the
Shadows are recent, though, and the players may not be ready to win the war.
Meanwhile, the Earth goverment back home seems to have its own
agenda, and will likely not be of any help in the fight against the darkness.
