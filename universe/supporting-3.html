<h3>Assistants to the Ambassadors</h3>

<dl>

<p>
<dt>
<img width=80 height=100
align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/lennier.gif">
Lennier
-
<a href="/lurk/making/cast.html#mumy">Bill Mumy</a>
<dd>
Delenn's aide, recently out of a monastery on the Minbari homeworld.  He reveres
Delenn as an almost holy figure and accepts her transformation without
question.  He has pledged his life to her, in fact, and is perfectly willing
to die by her side.  Still something of an innocent thanks to his isolated
upbringing, Lennier has learned some of the art of diplomacy during his tenure
on Babylon 5.

<p>
<dt>
<img width=80 height=100
align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/vir.gif">
Vir Cotto
-
<a href="/lurk/making/cast.html#furst">Stephen Furst</a>
<dd>
Londo's aide.  Vir feels strongly that the choices Londo has made over
the past year and a half are taking the Centauri down a self-destructive
and morally wrong path, and he's getting less and less shy about expressing
that opinion to Londo.  He feels somewhat powerless in his position, close
to the major decisions but always on the sidelines.

<h3>Other Characters</h3>

<dl>

<p>
<dt>
<img width=80 height=100
align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/marcus.gif">
Marcus Cole
-
Jason Carter
<dd>
A Ranger permanently stationed on Babylon 5.  Marcus has taken a liking to
Commander Ivanova, though she's approaching the relationship with more than
a little caution.  First appears in
<a href="/lurk/guide/045.html">"Matters of Honor."</a>

<p>
<dt>
<img width=80 height=100
align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/theo.gif">
Brother Theodore
-
Louis Turenne
<dd>
A Dominican monk, visiting the station to study the religious beliefs of
alien races.  First appears in
<a href="/lurk/guide/046.html">"Convictions."</a>

<p>
<dt>
<img width=80 height=100
align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/morden.gif">
Morden
-
Ed Wasser
<dd>
A member of the same expedition Sheridan's wife was on, Morden was captured
by the Shadows and works for them.  He is always accompanied by one or two
of them, though they're invisible to most people.
Never a major player, he is always ready to talk to Londo
and pass messages to and from his "associates."  Delenn and G'Kar have met
him, but only Delenn has any idea who he is.  Morden is meticulously polite,
but nonetheless is a menacing presence who can casually discuss the deaths
of tens of thousands of Narn as easily as most people talk about the weather.

<p>
<dt>
<img width=80 height=100
align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/zack.gif">
Zack Allen
-
Jeff Conaway
<dd>
One of Garibaldi's lieutenants, Zack is earnest and trustworthy, if not
necessarily the brightest person on the station.  He is a
member of the Nightwatch, though he's having second thoughts now that he
sees how it's being used to persecute and harass innocent people.

<p>
<dt>
<img width=80 height=100
align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/lyta2.gif">
Lyta Alexander
-
Patricia Tallman
<dd>
A former Psi Corps telepath -- the first one assigned to the station, in
fact.  Three years ago she scanned Ambassador Kosh, an experience that left
her forever altered, though she has told nobody the full extent of it.
Shortly thereafter she was recalled to Earth for questioning.  Now she's on
the run from the Corps, even working to expose some of its machinations.

<p>
<dt>
<img width=80 height=100
align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/sinclair.gif">
Ambassador Jeffrey Sinclair
-
Michael O'Hare
<dd>
The first commander of Babylon 5. Officially, he's on the Minbari homeworld
as Earth's ambassador, but his main function is as the head of the Rangers.
Sinclair is of special importance to Delenn, and though she hasn't fully
explained why, it's likely he carries a Minbari soul of some stature.  A
glimpse into the future when he was head of Babylon 5 revealed that he will
be involved in the theft of Babylon 4, and will possibly be witness to the
eventual destruction of Babylon 5 at Garibaldi's hands.

<p>
<dt>
<img width=80 height=100
align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/bester.gif">
Bester
-
Walter Koenig
<dd>
A Psi-Cop, one of an elite unit of the Psi Corps whose function is to track
down rogue telepaths, among other things.  Perhaps in part because of his
P12 psi rating -- more than twice as high as Lyta's -- he seems to have
risen to a position of some importance in the Corps.  Bester ruthlessly
pursues his agenda, which most of the time is the same as the Corps'.

<p>
<dt>
<img width=80 height=100
align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/refa.gif">
Lord Refa
-
William Forward
<dd>
A ruthless, unprincipled Centauri noble with whom Londo is cooperating in a
bid for power.  Refa and his cohorts are more or less in charge of the Centauri
Republic; the Emperor is simply a figurehead who follows their lead.

<p>
<dt>
<img width=80 height=100
align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/corwin.gif">
Lt. Corwin
-
Joshua Cox
<dd>
Third in command in C&amp;C, after Sheridan and Ivanova.  Corwin is shy but
well-intentioned, a loyal officer.
