<h3>Assistants to the Ambassadors</h3>

<dl>
<dt>
<img width=80 height=100
align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/vir.gif">
Vir Cotto
-
<a href="/lurk/making/cast.html#furst">Stephen Furst</a>
<dd>
Centauri assistant to Londo.  Generally timid and unsure of himself, Vir
occasionally works up the nerve to confront Londo about the dangerous path
he's following by dealing with Morden.

<p>
<dt>
<img width=80 height=100
align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/natoth-2.gif">
Na'Toth
-
Mary Kay Adams
<dd>
A female Narn, assistant to G'Kar.  She is one of the few who he's told about
his discovery that a new race (or rather, a very old race) is on the move.
She is fiercely loyal to G'Kar, even if
he's not ready to believe it at first.  She prefers the direct approach rather
than G'Kar's subterfuge and deception.

<p>
<dt>
<img width=80 height=100
align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/lennier.gif">
Lennier
-
<a href="/lurk/making/cast.html#mumy">Bill Mumy</a>
<dd>
Delenn's aide, fresh out of a monastery on the Minbari homeworld.  He reveres
Delenn as an almost holy figure and accepts her transformation without
question.  Still something of an innocent thanks to his isolated upbringing,
Lennier is slowly learning the ways of diplomacy.

<h3>Other Characters</h3>

<dl>
<dt>
<img width=80 height=100
align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/keffer.gif">
Lt. Warren Keffer
-
Robert Russler
<dd>
Head of Zeta Squadron, the newest of Babylon 5's fighter wings.
Keffer leads many of the excursions away from the station, when
the presence of a command-level officer isn't required.  Keffer's family
is back on Earth.

<p>
<dt>
<img width=80 height=100
align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/morden.gif">
Morden
-
Ed Wasser
<dd>
Little is known about the human agent of the Shadows.  He is able to
communicate with them directly, and is one of the few who know they've been
on Babylon 5.  Never a major player, he is always ready to talk to Londo
and pass messages to and from his "associates."  Delenn and G'Kar have met
him, but only Delenn has any idea who he is.  Morden is meticulously polite,
but nonetheless is a menacing presence who can casually discuss the deaths
of tens of thousands of Narn as easily as most people talk about the weather.

<p>
<dt>
<img width=80 height=100
align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/clark.gif">
President Morgan Clark - Gary McGurk 
<dd>
When President Santiago was killed in an "accidental" explosion, Clark
took office and immediately began his own agenda.  He personally
assigned Sheridan to his position, unaware of Sheridan's interest in
fighting the mounting corruption in Earth government.  Not much of an
advocate of Babylon 5's interests.

<p>
<dt>
<img width=80 height=100
align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/lyta.gif">
Lyta Alexander
-
<a href="/lurk/making/cast.html#tallman">Patricia Tallman</a>
<dd>
Lyta was Babylon 5's first commercial telepath, rating P5, in her early
thirties or late twenties.  She was transferred off the station shortly
after examining Kosh, presumably due to her newfound knowledge of the
Vorlons.


<p>
<dt>
<img width=80 height=100
align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/zack.gif">
Zack Allen
-
Jeff Conaway
<dd>
One of Garibaldi's lieutenants, Zack is earnest and trustworthy, if not
necessarily the brightest person on the station.  After the arrest of
Garibaldi's old aide for attempted murder (cf.
<a href="/lurk/guide/024.html">"Revelations,"</a>)
Zack has risen to a new level of importance in Garibaldi's staff.

<p>
<dt>
<img width=80 height=100
align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/sinclair.gif">
Ambassador Jeffrey Sinclair
-
<a href="/lurk/making/cast.html#ohare">Michael O'Hare</a>
<dd>
The first commander of Babylon 5. Shortly after the death of
President Santiago, Sinclair was recalled to Earth and assigned
to a new post, as the first human ambassador to the Minbari
(cf. comic
<a href="/lurk/comic/001.html">"In Darkness Find Me."</a>)
He was named commander of
Babylon 5 at the insistence of the Minbari, who captured him
during the Battle of the Line and scanned him. Delenn is
certain Sinclair has an important destiny (cf.
<a href="/lurk/guide/002.html">"Soul Hunter,"</a>
<a href="/lurk/guide/019.html">"A Voice in the Wilderness, part 2."</a>)
This is borne out by the brief glimpse into the future in
<a href="/lurk/guide/020.html">"Babylon Squared,"</a>
in which he was the leader of an army of light fighting in a great war.

<p>
See also JMS' announcement of, and some subsequent discussion
about,
<a href="/lurk/ftp/OHare.Leave">Michael O'Hare's departure.</a>

<p>
<dt>
<img width=80 height=100
align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/bester.gif">
Bester
-
Walter Koenig
<dd>
A Psi-Cop, one of an elite unit of the Psi Corps whose function is to track
down rogue telepaths, among other things.  Perhaps in part because of his
P12 psi rating -- more than twice as high as Talia's -- he seems to have
risen to a position of some importance in the Corps.  Bester ruthlessly
pursues his agenda, which most of the time is the same as the Corps'.

<p>
<dt>
<img width=80 height=100
align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/refa.gif">
Lord Refa
-
William Forward
<dd>
A ruthless, unprincipled Centauri noble with whom Londo is cooperating in a
bid for power.  First appears in
<a href="/lurk/guide/025.html">"The Geometry of Shadows."</a>
