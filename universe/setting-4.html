The Shadow War is at a standstill as 2261 begins.  Ancient, implacable
enemies, held at bay by races long dead or departed, the
<strong>Shadows</strong> were
no more than legends to most of the younger races.

<p>
All that changed in 2260.  The Shadows, awakened years earlier from a
millenium-long slumber on their ancestral home of Z'ha'dum, gradually made
their presence known, and their purpose became clear: weeding out the weak and
defenseless among the younger races to promote rapid evolution.  Moving
largely behind the scenes, they set the younger races upon one another,
causing wars and inciting genocide.  The Shadows are the embodiment of
the question, "What do you want?"  They seek not military victory, but
philosophical dominance, a universe in which younger races scramble madly
to attain their goals without regard for the consequences.  Such an
environment demands chaos, and it's chaos the Shadows have so effectively
brought upon the major races.

<br clear=all>

<p>
<img align=right width=80 height=100 alt="" src="/lurk/gif/chars/vorlon-angel.gif">
When the other First Ones departed for reasons of their own, the
<strong>Vorlons</strong>
were left behind to oppose the Shadow philosophy.  If the Shadows represent
chaos, the Vorlons are lords of order: they seek the same outcome, the
advancement of younger races, but on their terms, whether their charges
like it or not.  The Vorlons prefer to ask the question, "Who are you?"  It
is a question that leads to introspection and spiritual growth, but not to
expansion or scientific advancement.

<p>
Unfortunately, the struggle between the two philosophies is played out not
among the ancients, but among the younger races, unwitting pawns in a game
few yet realize is being played.

<br clear=all>

<p>
<img align=right width=80 height=100 alt="" src="/lurk/gif/chars/clark.gif">
The <strong>Earth Alliance,</strong> headquartered in Geneva, is led
by President Clark.  Clark came to power with the help of
the Shadows and the Psi Corps, a Shadow-dominated agency created to control the
telepathic talents planted furtively in the human gene pool by the Vorlons.
ISN, a blatant propaganda machine, controls the flow of information to the
citizenry and the outside world.  Political dissent is stifled
by an Orwellian agency called the Night Watch.  Passage to and from the
Earth Alliance is difficult thanks to the imposition of strict martial law,
ostensibly to protect humans from alien influences that might spark another
devastating war.  So far, Earth has largely stayed out of the Shadow War;
Clark's extreme xenophobia hasn't led him to strike out against the
other races.  Rumors of a resistance movement persist, but so far they're
nothing more than rumors.

<br clear=all>

<p>
<img align=right width=100 height=80 alt="" src="/lurk/gif/b5port.gif">
Until recently,
<strong>Babylon 5</strong> was an outpost operated by the Earth Allance, built
with the aid of a few alien governments.  Captain Sheridan declared
independence in mid-2260 in opposition to Clark's totalitarian policies.
By continuing its function as a remote outpost used by a multitude of species,
B5 has been able to maintain its autonomy from Earth, though with autonomy has
come the isolation of most of B5's crew from their families and friends
back home.  With the war against the Shadows out in the open, the station has
served as a base of operations, a gathering point for those who oppose the
Shadows: the Vorlon-inspired Army of Light.

<br clear=all>

<p>
<img align=right width=100 height=80 alt="" src="/lurk/gif/wsport.gif">
The <strong>Rangers</strong> are the core of the Army of Light.  Made up
primarily of humans and Minbari, the Rangers were formed to gather information
and perform covert operations to undermine the work of the Shadows.  The
Army of Light as a whole is composed of the Narn, the Minbari, and various
minor races,
all of whom feel that the Shadows must be opposed at any cost.  By
implication, they side with the Vorlons, and in fact the Vorlons have
encouraged the Army's formation, contributing tidbits of advanced technology
toward the construction of the White Star Fleet of warships.

<p>
<img align=right width=80 height=100 alt="" src="/lurk/gif/chars/lennier4.gif">
An old, highly spiritual race, the <strong>Minbari</strong> are humanoid with
exterior bone crests on their heads.  A thousand years ago, the Minbari fought
the Shadows alongside the Vorlons, and came to trust the Vorlons implicitly.
Minbari society is divided into three castes: Warrior, Religious, and
Worker.  After a recent splintering of their political leadership, Minbari
society is at an impasse.  The Religious and Worker Castes have given their
support to the Army of Light, but the Warrior Caste, arrogant and
isolationist, resents such involvement with inferior races.

<p>
Only a few know that Minbar and Earth have linked histories: a human, Sinclair,
the first commander of Babylon 5, traveled back in time to the previous war
against the Shadows and delivered a new base of operations, Babylon 4, to the
Minbari.  Sinclair became a great spiritual leader, the founder of Minbari
society and a prophet thanks to his knowledge of future events.  Sinclair's
journey opened a doorway between Minbari and humans, and since the last war
a thousand years ago, Minbari souls have been slowly reincarnating in human
bodies.  Upon discovering that, the Religious Caste halted the Earth-Minbari
War, a decision still resented by the Warrior Caste.

The <strong>Centauri Republic,</strong> until recently a declining empire, has
allied itself with the Shadows and is enjoying a renaissance of military and
political might.  The Centauri are even allowing the Shadows to house ships
and personnel on their homeworld.  The insane Centauri Emperor, Cartagia,
believes the Shadows will elevate him to godhood if he cooperates with them.
Instead, the pact is likely to leave Cartagia dead and Centauri Prime in
ruins.  Centauri are mostly human in appearance; men wear their hair in fans
whose height indicate social standing, and women have shaved heads.

<br clear=all>

<p>
<img align=right width=80 height=100 alt="" src="/lurk/gif/chars/gkar.gif">
Once a major power, the <strong>Narn Regime</strong> was one of the victims of
Centauri expansionism, especially humiliating since they were unwilling subjects
of the Centauri Republic a hundred years ago.
Under the leadership of former ambassador G'Kar, now living in
sanctuary on Babylon 5, the Narn are assisting with Babylon 5 security and
acting as footsoldiers for the Army of Light.  Narns have a
reptilian appearance and are easily provoked.
