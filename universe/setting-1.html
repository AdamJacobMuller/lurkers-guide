<blockquote><cite>
It was the dawn of the third age of mankind, ten years after the
Earth/Minbari war.  The Babylon Project was a dream given form.  Its
goal, to prevent another war by creating a place where humans and aliens
could work out their differences peacefully.  It's a port of call - home
away from home for diplomats, hustlers, entrepreneurs, and wanderers.
Humans and aliens wrapped in two million, five hundred thousand tons
of spinning metal, all alone in the night.  It can be a dangerous place,
but it's our last best hope for peace.  This is the story of the last of
the Babylon stations.  The year is 2258.  The name of the place is
Babylon 5.
</cite> - Commander Sinclair

<p>
With the completion of the last of the Babylon stations in 2257, the
galaxy is enjoying a fragile peace.  Babylon 5 is functioning as planned,
defusing disputes among the five major governments and acting as a hub
for interstellar commerce and communication.

<p>
<img align=right width=80 height=100 alt="" src="/lurk/gif/chars/sinclair.gif">
The <strong>Earth Alliance,</strong> headquartered in Geneva,
is in charge of the station and the
surrounding space.  It is led by President Luis Santiago, a forward-looking
politician who values Earth's participation in Babylon 5 tremendously.
Of special note is a branch of the Earth government called
<strong>Psi-Corps,</strong> responsible for the tracking and training of
human telepaths.  Pictured here is Jeffrey Sinclair,
commander of Babylon 5.
<br clear=all>

<p>
<img align=right width=80 height=100 alt="" src="/lurk/gif/chars/delenn-1.gif">
Earth's former adversary, the <strong>Minbari Federation,</strong> was the
major alien contributor to the construction of Babylon 5.  An old, highly 
spiritual race, Minbari are humanoid with exterior bone crests on their
heads.  The Minbari are ruled by a body known as the Grey Council,
three members from each of the three castes of Minbari society.  The reason
behind the sudden Minbari surrender at the climax of the Earth-Minbari War
is a closely-guarded secret, but what isn't a secret is that the warrior
caste was none too pleased about the order; even today, it is a source of
tension within Minbari society.<br clear=all>

<p>
<img align=right width=80 height=100 alt="" src="/lurk/gif/chars/londo.gif">
The <strong>Centauri</strong> were the first aliens encountered
by humanity.  Physically, they look nearly identical to humans,
and in fact the Centauri initially claimed that Earth was a lost
colony (a claim they later retracted after humans discovered that
the similarities weren't so great after all.)  Centauri women are
bald; men wear their hair in peacock-style fans whose length indicates the
wearer's social standing.  The Centauri Republic is a fading empire, slowly
losing control of its member worlds, a decline much like that of the
British Empire.<br clear=all>

<p>
<img align=right width=80 height=100 alt="" src="/lurk/gif/chars/gkar.gif">
Among those formerly under Centauri domination are the <strong>Narn,</strong>
a reptilian-looking race who fought off their oppressors in a century-long
war of attrition.  Now the Narn Regime is building its military up, trying
to settle the score through an aggressive expansionist policy.  Most Narn
would like nothing better than to see the Centauri wiped from the face of
the universe, and from all appearances, they'll shortly be in a position to
get their wish.<br clear=all>

<p>
<img align=right width=80 height=100 alt="" src="/lurk/gif/chars/kosh.gif">
The final major government represented on Babylon 5 is the <strong>Vorlon
Empire.</strong>  The Vorlons are shrouded in mystery.  Even though their
ambassador is on the station, nobody knows what they look like; they dress
in bulky encounter suits.  Whether the suits are there to keep a noxious
atmosphere in or prying eyes out is a matter of some debate.  The Vorlons
are an extremely powerful race; no expedition into their space has been
heard from again.  They seem to have had dealings with the Minbari in the
past, though neither the Minbari nor the Vorlons care to discuss the matter.
<br clear=all>

<p>
<img align=right width=160 height=100 alt="" src="/lurk/gif/chars/league2.gif">
Each of the five races has an ambassador on the Babylon 5 Advisory Council,
something like the UN Security Council.  In addition, a number of smaller
governments are members of the <strong>League of Non-Aligned Worlds,</strong>
which is also represented on the Council.  This group is generally sympathetic
to Earth, largely because Earth stepped in to save many of them from invasion
by a hostile race (now extinct.)<br clear=all>

<p>
The peace is most often threatened by aggressive behavior on the part of
the Narn, or by lingering tensions between Earth and the Minbari warrior
caste, a sizable fraction of which wouldn't mind a rematch.  And there are
enduring mysteries to set everyone on edge: the reasons behind the Minbari
surrender and the sudden disappearance of Babylon 4, the nature and motives
of the Vorlons, the hint of dark forces moving behind the scenes in the
Earth government.
