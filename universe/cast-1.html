Despite its fantastic setting, <cite>Babylon 5</cite> is at its core a story
about people, about the choices they make and the consequences of those
choices.  <cite>Babylon 5</cite>'s characters are as interesting and varied
as the situations they encounter.

<img align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/sinclair.gif" width=80 height=100>
<a href="/lurk/chars/sinclair.html">Commander Jeffrey Sinclair</a>
-
<a href="/lurk/making/cast.html#ohare">Michael O'Hare</a>
<dd>
The commander of Babylon 5 and representative of the Earth Alliance.
A survivor of the climactic Battle of the Line at the end of the
Earth-Minbari War, Sinclair sometimes yearns
for his days as a hotshot fighter pilot, and partially for that reason,
he's given to taking unnecessary personal risks.  He's uncomfortable in his
position and in fact isn't entirely sure why he was given command of such a
major post and made a high-level diplomat; his stiff demeanor is perhaps due
to a fear that he isn't up to the job he's been given.  Sinclair was born on
Mars Colony and is 39 years old.

<p>
<dt>
<img align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/ivanova.gif" width=80 height=100>
Lt. Commander Susan Ivanova
-
<a href="/lurk/making/cast.html#christian">Claudia Christian</a>
<dd>
Second in command and in charge of the day-to-day operations of Babylon 5,
Ivanova is an ambitious career officer.  She can be quirky or
pessimistic at times, but she has a dry sense of humor that shows
itself in the rare moments she is able to relax among others. Born in
St. Petersburg, Russia, and raised abroad on Earth, she has a strong
dislike for the Psi-Corps, whose legally-mandated drug treatments drove
her mother to suicide after it was discovered her mother was a latent
telepath. She is new on the station and often buries herself in her
work; her friends are few and her family is all but gone.

<p>
<dt>
<img align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/garibaldi.gif" width=80 height=100>
Security Chief Michael Garibaldi
-
<a href="/lurk/making/cast.html#doyle">Jerry Doyle</a>
<dd>
In charge of security on Babylon 5.  He has a troubled past, bouncing from
position to position and trying to overcome alcoholism.  He was picked by
Sinclair for the job; the two worked together in the past.  Sinclair
knew that Garibaldi would be persistent, not willing to give in to
political pressures -- in Sinclair's words, "a pain in the ass."  Garibaldi
is something of a smart-aleck, always ready to crack a joke, but given to
bouts of self-doubt and introspection when nobody's looking.

<p>
<dt>
<img align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/talia.gif" width=80 height=100>
Talia Winters
-
<a href="/lurk/making/cast.html#thompson">Andrea Thompson</a>
<dd>
Babylon 5's resident telepath, on her first solo assignment, with level 5 psi
rating, bound by the rules and regulations of the Psi Corps. She sells her
telepathic services to businessmen, and occasionally assists Sinclair in
negotiations. Talia was raised and trained by the Psi Corps, meaning that
that organization is her family.

<p>
<dt>
<img align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/franklin.gif" width=80 height=100>
Dr. Stephen Franklin
-
<a href="/lurk/making/cast.html#biggs">Richard Biggs</a>
<dd>
Dedicated and assured, a specialist in xenobiology (alien biology,) and
in charge of Medlab on Babylon 5. His background is mainly in
experimental medicine, so his bedside manner is occasionally not what it
should be. His strong sense of personal morality is at times in
conflict with his duties as the chief medical provider for aliens from
hundreds of worlds and cultures, some of whom view his obligations
rather differently. In his middle thirties now, he spent
years hitchhiking through space, offering his doctoral services in
exchange for the opportunity to examine new life forms.

<p>
<dt>
<img align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/londo.gif" width=80 height=100>
<a href="/lurk/chars/londo.html">Ambassador Londo Mollari</a>
-
<a href="/lurk/making/cast.html#jurasik">Peter Jurasik</a>
<dd>
The representative of the Centauri Republic.  Londo views Babylon 5's
mission as something of a sham, with limited chance of helping his people
regain their lost glory and sense of purpose.
His assignment on Babylon 5 is not considered an important position, in spite
of the high status that his regalia and high-standing hair would indicate. A
war hero in his younger days, he has since grown decadent and indulgent.
Londo can often be found
in one of the station's bars or casinos, drinking himself to oblivion.
He has a biting, cynical sense of humor.  Perhaps his only real friend is
Garibaldi, who understands something of what Londo has been through.

<p>
<dt>
<img align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/delenn-1.gif" width=80 height=100>
Ambassador Delenn
-
<a href="/lurk/making/cast.html#furlan">Mira Furlan</a>
<dd>
Represents the Minbari Federation.  Delenn is a member of the highest Minbari
governmental body, the Grey Council, and why she's masquerading as a lowly
ambassador is one of the ongoing mysteries of <cite>Babylon 5</cite>.
A member of the religious caste, Delenn's belief in fate and destiny is
often evident.  She is fascinated by humans and tries to learn all about them;
some say she is suspiciously watchful of Commander Sinclair.

<p>
<dt>
<img align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/gkar.gif" width=80 height=100>
Ambassador G'Kar
-
<a href="/lurk/making/cast.html#katsulas">Andreas Katsulas</a>
<dd>
The representative of the Narn Regime rose to his position in part thanks to
his wife's renown as a hero of the revolutionary war against the Centauri,
but his own ambition and ability are more than equal to the job.
G'Kar will waste no opportunity to turn a situation to the Narns' advantage,
even if it means antagonizing everyone else on the station.  He takes pride
in his position and himself, a pride perhaps bordering on arrogance at times.
G'Kar would like nothing better than to see the Centauri, and Londo in
particular, pay dearly for their brutal occupation of Narn. 

<p>
<dt>
<img align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/kosh.gif" width=80 height=100>
<a href="/lurk/chars/kosh.html">Ambassador Kosh Naranek</a>
-
animatronics
<dd>
Native voice
designed by Chris Franke.<br>
English translation: Ardwight Chamberlain.
<p>
Even less is known about Ambassador Kosh than about his race.  He arrived on
the station in 2257 and was promptly the victim of a complex assassination plot
involving the Minbari and others.  He is rarely seen in council meetings,
claiming that "we take no interest in the affairs of others," and Vorlons'
reasons for coming to Babylon 5 at all are unknown.
Kosh communicates through a complex sequence of musical tones, translated into
English by a device on his encounter suit. When he speaks, his words are few
and sound cryptic, but often have a strange truth to them.
Kosh's quarters are
filled with a dense atmosphere of methane and other gases; whether he
needs it or is using it to make himself less accessible is an open question.
Even when he's receiving visitors there, Kosh wears his suit.
