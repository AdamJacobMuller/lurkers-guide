Despite its fantastic setting, <cite>Babylon 5</cite> is at its core a story
about people, about the choices they make and the consequences of those
choices.  <cite>Babylon 5</cite>'s characters are as interesting and varied
as the situations they encounter.

<dt>
<img align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/sheridan.gif" width=80 height=100>
<a href="/lurk/chars/sheridan.html">Captain John Sheridan</a>
-
<a href="/lurk/making/cast.html#boxleitner">Bruce Boxleitner</a>
<dd>
The commander of Babylon 5 and representative of the Earth Alliance.
One of Earth's few war heros, Sheridan scored the only major victory against
the Minbari during the war, something which has earned him the hatred of the
Minbari warrior caste.  Generally jovial, occasionally serious, Sheridan was
hand-picked by the President to replace Sinclair.  Sheridan is still recovering
from the loss of his wife Anna, who died on an alien archaeological dig.
Most of his career has been spent aboard starships; he's still in the process
of getting used to being the head of what is essentially a small city in space.
Sheridan and Ivanova have served together in the past.

<p>
<dt>
<img align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/ivanova.gif" width=80 height=100>
Commander Susan Ivanova
-
<a href="/lurk/making/cast.html#christian">Claudia Christian</a>
<dd>
Second in command and in charge of the day-to-day operations of Babylon 5,
Ivanova is an ambitious career officer.  She can be quirky or
pessimistic at times, but she has a dry sense of humor that shows
itself in the rare moments she is able to relax among others. Born in
St. Petersburg, Russia, and raised abroad on Earth, she has a strong
dislike for the Psi-Corps, whose legally-mandated drug treatments drove
her mother to suicide after it was discovered her mother was a latent
telepath.
Although she has become more comfortable with her job and her role on
Babylon 5, she has a tendancy to bury herself in her work.  Her promotion
to Commander has given her new ambassadorial duties, which she finds
extremely challenging.

<p>
<dt>
<img align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/garibaldi.gif" width=80 height=100>
Security Chief Michael Garibaldi
-
<a href="/lurk/making/cast.html#doyle">Jerry Doyle</a>
<dd>
In charge of security on Babylon 5.  He has a troubled past, bouncing from
position to position and trying to overcome alcoholism.  He was picked by
the station's first commander, Sinclair, who
knew that Garibaldi would be persistent, not willing to give in to
political pressures -- in Sinclair's words, "a pain in the ass."  Garibaldi
is something of a smart-aleck, always ready to crack a joke, but given to
bouts of self-doubt and introspection when nobody's looking.  His natural
sense of paranoia wasn't reduced when he was shot in the back by his own
second-in-command while trying to prevent the assassination of President
Santiago; he recovered, but is now convinced that something is dreadfully wrong
at the heart of the Earth Alliance.

<p>
<dt>
<img align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/talia.gif" width=80 height=100>
Talia Winters
-
<a href="/lurk/making/cast.html#thompson">Andrea Thompson</a>
<dd>
Babylon 5's resident telepath, on her first solo assignment, with level 5 psi
rating, bound by the rules and regulations of the Psi Corps. She sells her
telepathic services to businessmen and occasionally assists the station
personnel.  Talia was raised and trained by the Psi Corps, meaning that
that organization is her family.  Last year, she was visited by an old teacher
who had undergone a Psi Corps experiment.  He altered her, giving her
telekinetic abilities and possibly other powers as well.  He also warned her
of the changing nature of the Corps; she is now not entirely sure she trusts
its motives.

<p>
<dt>
<img align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/franklin.gif" width=80 height=100>
Dr. Stephen Franklin
-
<a href="/lurk/making/cast.html#biggs">Richard Biggs</a>
<dd>
Dedicated and assured, a specialist in xenobiology (alien biology,) and
in charge of Medlab on Babylon 5. His background is mainly in
experimental medicine, so his bedside manner is occasionally not what it
should be. His strong sense of personal morality is at times in
conflict with his duties as the chief medical provider for aliens from
hundreds of worlds and cultures, some of whom view his obligations
rather differently. In his middle thirties now, he spent
years hitchhiking through space, offering his doctoral services in
exchange for the opportunity to examine new life forms.
Dr. Franklin is known to operate outside the rules when he feel the issue
is important.  He runs a free clinic in the Downbelow section for those who
cannot afford medical care.

<p>
<dt>
<img align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/londo.gif" width=80 height=100>
Ambassador Londo Mollari
-
<a href="/lurk/making/cast.html#jurasik">Peter Jurasik</a>
<dd>
The representative of the Centauri Republic.  Londo views Babylon 5's
mission as something of a sham, with limited chance of helping his people
regain their lost glory and sense of purpose.  He has a biting, cynical
sense of humor.  Without realizing it at first, Londo has struck a bargain
with the Shadows, who are working to advance his career and restore the
Centauri to their past splendor, asking in return only the granting of an
unspecified "favor" at some point in the future. It is a bargain he is
already beginning to regret, but the restoration of his people means so
much to him that he feels it's worth the price.

<p>
<dt>
<img align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/delenn-2.gif" width=80 height=100>
Ambassador Delenn
-
<a href="/lurk/making/cast.html#furlan">Mira Furlan</a>
<dd>
Represents the Minbari. A member of the Minbari ruling body,
the Grey Council, she came to Babylon 5 posing as a simple
ambassador to study humans after the discovery that some of them carry
Minbari souls.  She was offered the leadership of the Council but turned
it down, instead returning to Babylon 5 to play a role in a prophecy
involving a struggle between darkness and light. Once back, after
consulting with the Vorlon ambassador, she used a mysterious
device to transform herself into a bizarre half-Minbari, half-human
hybrid.  She claims she undertook the change to act as a bridge of
understanding between humans and Minbari; whether that's the real reason
or not, only she knows.

<p>
<dt>
<img align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/gkar.gif" width=80 height=100>
Ambassador G'Kar
-
<a href="/lurk/making/cast.html#katsulas">Andreas Katsulas</a>
<dd>
Represents the Narn Regime.
Though ambitious and often antagonistic, G'Kar is extremely spiritual, and
his knowledge of ancient scripture has led him to realize that an ancient
race has come back to help the Centauri rebuild their empire.  He has even
survived an attack on the shadows, but none in his own government or the
Babylon 5 council believe him.

<p>
<dt>
<img align="middle" src="/lurk/gif/chars/kosh.gif" width=80 height=100>
Ambassador Kosh Naranek
-
animatronics
<dd>
Native voice
designed by Chris Franke.<br>
English translation: Ardwight Chamberlain.
<p>
After a year and a half on the station, Kosh and his people are still an
enigma.  With the coming of the Shadows -- Kosh is one of the few who seem
to know about them -- he has started attending council meetings, though his
reasons for coming to Babylon 5 are still unknown.
Kosh communicates through a complex sequence of musical tones, translated into
English by a device on his encounter suit. When he speaks, his words are few
and sound cryptic, but often have a strange truth to them.
Kosh's quarters are
filled with a dense atmosphere of methane and other gases; whether he
needs it or is using it to make himself less accessible is an open question.
Even when he's receiving visitors there, Kosh wears his suit.
