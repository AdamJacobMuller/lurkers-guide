<h2><a name="SY">Synopsis</a></h2>

<p>
Ivanova clears a Narn ship, the D'Vordo, for docking.  An urgent call from
G'Kar comes in; he demands immediate clearance to depart the station from
bay four.  When she refuses, he sets his ship to launch anyway; Ivanova warns
the D'Vordo to abort its approach.  Garibaldi rushes to bay four to try to
stop G'Kar, but when he arrives, G'Kar stuns him.

<p>
G'Kar takes Garibaldi with him, but Garibaldi wakes up and fires a starweb,
a sort of net made of energy, at G'Kar, entangling him.

<p>
G'Kar's ship nearly collides with the D'Vordo as it rockets full speed away
from the station.

<p>
Ivanova tells Sheridan that Garibaldi is nowhere to be found; she believes
G'Kar has taken him off the station.  Sheridan heads for a shuttle to
pursue G'Kar.

<p>
Garibaldi and G'Kar float in a cylindrical area.  G'Kar is still caught in
the starweb, and Garibaldi sings annoying songs to him, threatening to
continue until G'Kar reveals what's going on.

<p>
On his way to the shuttle, Sheridan is intercepted by Greegil, a Narn who
claims to be a relative of G'Kar's, newly arrived on the D'Vordo.  He
says he can help Sheridan catch
G'Kar.  Sheridan reluctantly brings him along.  As they fly in pursuit, Sheridan
tries to find out exactly how Greegil is related to G'Kar.  Greegil won't
offer any information unless Sheridan offers something in exchange.

<p>
Garibaldi continues to sing.  Eventually, G'Kar falls asleep.  Garibaldi
wakes him up and asks where the food is; G'Kar answers that he doesn't need
to eat, as Narns can hibernate six days at a time.  "I'll be happy to watch
you starve to death," G'Kar says.  "At least it'll be quieter."  When Garibaldi
points out that G'Kar will die, too, trapped in the starweb, G'Kar answers,
"There are worse things than death.  Dishonor is one."

<p>
Garibaldi continues to search for food, but he's never seen a ship like the
one he's in: no food, no controls, just solid walls encircling them.  He begins
to sing "It's a Small World," which causes G'Kar to surrender.

<p>
Sheridan and Greegil haggle over the value of information.  Finally, Greegil
tells Sheridan how he's related to G'Kar, but the Narn familial ties he
describes are meaningless to Sheridan.

<p>
G'Kar shows Garibaldi where his food, a Narn delicacy called phroomis, is
stashed.  He notes that Garibaldi does seem to have some negotiating skills.
On Narn, he says, negotiation is an art.  Garibaldi asks G'Kar about the
ship, but G'Kar says it's better he doesn't know.  Garibaldi convinces him
to play a game of "laser-mirror-starweb," loser tells all.

<p>
Sheridan and Greegil catch up with G'Kar's ship, which doesn't respond to
Sheridan's signals.  Greegil tells Sheridan that G'Kar is possessed by a
Lokvar, a seizure of the mind, that may cause G'Kar to be violent.  Greegil
predicts that Sheridan will have to shoot G'Kar.

<p>
Garibaldi wins two games of laser-mirror-starweb, but G'Kar still refuses
to talk about the ship.

<p>
Sheridan grapples G'Kar's ship while Greegil tries to get him to put up
the shuttle's shields in case G'Kar fires at them.

<p>
G'Kar and Garibaldi hear a loud clanking sound from one end of their chamber.

<p>
Sheridan and Greegil approach the airlock through a docking tube they've
extended from Sheridan's shuttle.  They open the door.

<p>
The end of the cylinder swings open as G'Kar and Garibaldi watch apprehensively.

<p>
Sheridan and Greegil enter G'Kar's ship... and find it empty.  Greegil
concludes that G'Kar never left the station.

<p>
A cleaning robot enters the cylinder.  G'Kar set his ship on autopilot; they
are actually in Babylon 5's core.  G'Kar shouts that it's Garibaldi's fault --
with just G'Kar's mass in the axis tube, the cleaning robot wouldn't have
come ahead of schedule.  The two of them flee through the other end of the
cylinder, but the axis tube runs the length of the station, five miles, and
there are apparently no exits along the way.

<p>
G'Kar's ship begins to self-destruct.  He and Greegil flee.  Greegil gets to
Sheridan's ship first, and promptly turns around and pushes the airlock door
shut as Sheridan floats toward it.  G'Kar's ship explodes before Sheridan's
shuttle can escape; the shuttle's occupant screams...


<H2><A NAME="BP">Backplot</A></H2>
<ul>

   <li> Narn children are taught the art of negotiation at an early age; the
	Narn consider themselves master hagglers.

   <li> If Greegil is to be believed, the Narn kinial system has several ranks
	denoting levels of family obligation:  this-kini, val-kini, dar-kini,
	on-kini, dru-kini, bas-kini, and ini-darka.  Ini-darka is the highest
	rank.

</ul>

<H2><A NAME="UQ">Unanswered Questions</A></H2>
<ul>

   <li> Did Sheridan make it onto the shuttle?

   <li> What does Greegil really want, and how is he related (familially or
	otherwise) to G'Kar?

   <li> Why is G'Kar trying to avoid him, if that's what's happening?

</ul>

<H2><A NAME="AN">Analysis</A></H2>
<ul>

   <li> Why would G'Kar drag Garibaldi all the way from the docking bay to
	the core of the station?  Clearly Garibaldi wasn't conscious for
	most of the trip or he would have known he wasn't on G'Kar's ship,
	so G'Kar could have left him in the docking bay or in a closet and
	nobody would have been any the wiser.

</ul>

<H2><A NAME="NO">Notes</A></H2>
<ul>

   <li> This story takes place in early spring 2259, between the episodes
	<a href="/lurk/guide/025.html">"The Geometry of Shadows"</a>
	and
	<a href="/lurk/guide/026.html">"A Distant Star."</a>

   <li> Laser-mirror-starweb is rock-paper-scissors with different names.

   <li> At one point (just after they haggle) Sheridan calls Greegil "Greelig."

   <li> This issue features a computer-generated cover picture by Foundation
	Imaging, a rendering of G'Kar's ship nearly hitting the D'Vordo.

   <li> During one of the negotiation scenes, Greegil says, "You'd have me cut
	my own throat, you dibbler".  This is probably a reference to Terry
	Pratchett's Discworld series of novels, which feature a salesman called
	"Cut-me-own-throat Dibbler."

   <li> This story introduces a lot of gadgets we've never seen in the series
	(and probably never will.)  The starweb and "shields" on Earth ships
	are two that seem like they would have appeared in the show if
	they were part of the canonical B5 universe.  The maintenance robot in
	the station's core is questionable, though it at least isn't
	inconsistent with anything in the series.  The stun gas used by G'Kar
	might be the same as the "morph gas" mentioned in
	<a href="/lurk/guide/012.html">"By Any Means Necessary."</a>

</ul>

<ul>

   <li> Ron did a CGI cover, though I've only seen a B&W repro, and
	can't vouch for it in detail.
