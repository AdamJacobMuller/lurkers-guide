<h2>JMS's comments on the poll:</h2> (August 31, 1995)
<p> In *general*, the P5 ratings poll tends to reflect my own opinions of the show, which is generally a good thing, I suppose.
The ones I think are knockouts tend to do well.
From time to time, I'm a bit surprised -- I still think that Parliament of Dreams is rated lower than I'd rate it, ditto for Soul Hunter and one or two others -- but what I've found is that generally the real serious episodes get rated higher, while the 
lighter ones (like Geometry of Shadows, which is still something of a favorite) get rated lower.
<p> What's great is that this season [2], we haven't had one single episode on the level of War Prayer or Infection or Grail, some of our weaker first season eps.
The worst we've done is pretty darned good.
What we're now working for in year three is that they're all better than that at their baseline rating.
