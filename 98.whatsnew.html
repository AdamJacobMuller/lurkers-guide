	A plea, if you'll forgive a slightly off-topic entry here:

	<p>
	I'm being bombarded with tons of E-mail asking me B5 trivia questions.
	If you're considering asking me to help you cheat in a trivia contest,
	please don't -- you may think it's a clever and unique idea to ask
	the guy who runs the Lurker's Guide to help you out, but I assure
	you you'll be in line behind a couple hundred other clever and unique
	thinkers.  It was already tiresome after the first 5 or 10; now it's
	downright frustrating and is taking up a substantial part of what
	little time I have to go through Guide-related mail.

	A lot of people have written asking why there aren't images for
	most of the episodes in season five.  It's nothing nefarious, just
	a result of some household rearranging a few months ago that
	makes it a lot less convenient for me to digitize stills for the
	guide pages.  Rest assured that I do intend to put stills on the
	pages that don't already have them.  In the meantime, I've grabbed
	some images from
	<a href="http://tnt.turner.com/babylon5/">TNT's site</a>
	for the most recent few episodes as placeholders.

	Another day, another problem.  The permissions on the Lurker's Guide
