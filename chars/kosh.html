<h1>The Vorlons and Ambassador Kosh</h1>
<h3>as written by J. Michael Straczynski</h3>
<p>
Let's talk about the Vorlons...because there ain't much we can SAY about
the Vorlons...because nobody <strong>knows</strong> anything about them.
<p>
In our opening movie, everyone's awaiting the arrival of the fifth and
final ambassador (four if you don't count Sinclair) from the primary alien
governments.  He is a Vorlon, a race we have tried, without much success,
to learn about ever since we first picked up their transmissions. Several
scout ships were sent on First Contact missions.  All of them met with
unfortunate "accidents" upon entering Vorlon space.  
The Vorlons tendered their most <em>sincere</em> apologies.
<p>
And suggested no further expeditions.
<p>
Now, at last, with B5 becoming functional, and all of the <em>other</em>
ambassadors in place, it no longer makes strategic sense to continue in
their isolation.  So the arrival of the Vorlon is a Big Deal.  No human has
ever even <strong>seen</strong> a Vorlon.  
<p>
And they play it right up to the hilt.  The ambassador -- Kosh Naranek --
maintains only audio contact with B5 as his ship makes the long voyage,
citing "problems" with video.  He clearly doesn't want to broadcast the
Vorlon face all over the quadrant.  So no problem, after all, he has to
arrive eventually, and they'll see him then.
<p>
Not quite.
<p>
The ship arrives.  The Vorlon ambassador emerges from his ship...and well,
y'see, he comes from a very different environment.  Lots of methane and
CO2.  Our atmosphere is poisonous to Vorlons.  So he emerges wearing an
Encounter Suit...which covers every square inch of his body except for his
hands -- assuming those <strong>are</strong> his hands -- with a dark faceplate in the
front.  The only place he can remove all of that is in his quarters, and
there are no vids in his quarters, no way to observe him or see his true
face.
<p>
So...even now, no human has <strong>still</strong> ever seen a Vorlon.
<p>
Well, that's not <em>entirely</em> true.  
Legend has it that one human saw a Vorlon.  A pilot who crashed, off
course, on a Vorlon colony.
<p>
According to that legend, the human who saw a Vorlon...was turned to stone.
But, after all, it's only a legend.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<h4>Why are the Vorlons allowed to participate in Babylon 5?</h4>
<p>
     The Vorlons are the great unknown.  They occupy a *huge* sector of space.
No expedition ever sent to Vorlon space has ever returned, or sent back word.
No human had ever even *seen* a Vorlon prior to Kosh's arrival on B5.  Their
technology is vastly superior to just about everyone else's.  To unravel the
mystery, to maybe get a *piece* of their tech, is more than sufficient
inducement, I'd think.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
     We will reveal what Kosh is a LOT sooner than year 5.  Closer to the end
of year 2.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<em>Is Kosh what he/she/it appears to be?</em>
<p>
     Kosh is always and forever *exactly* what he appears to be, no less
and no more.  At the same time, Kosh is absolutely *nothing* like what
he appears to be.
<p>
     These are not contradictory statements.
<p>
     And this is about the straightest answer I've given yet on the
subject, believe it or not.
