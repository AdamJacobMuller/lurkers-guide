<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>By Any Means Necessary...</H3>

<P>
When diplomats from the universe's two warring superpowers come to
Babylon 5 for a peace summit, Captain Sheridan and the
Earthforce Personnel know that security is paramount. But
a brilliant con woman is making plans of her own - plans
for the ambassadors of both Centauri and Narn - and in the belly
of B5 the seeds of rebellion are being sewn....

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Betrayals</H3>

<P>
A twin brother and sister, equally committed to their cause but
divided by strategy, seek liberation for the planet, T'll. Then a
T'llin exile is murdered, and violence erupts on Babylon 5, its
internal communications hopelessly scrambled. With rebels
threatening to bathe the peace conference in blood, and hostile
warships approaching, Garibaldi must plot a rescue of Sheridan
and the diplomats. But it may be too late. The T'llin
have learned the art of destruction from masters, and for them 
freedom is worth any price: even self-annihilation.

<H2><A NAME="SY">Synopsis</A></H2>


<P>
The book opens in Sheridan's office with Garibaldi, Ivanova and Franklin 
in 
attendance.  Plans are arduously being reviewed for the upcoming peace 
conference between the Narn and the Centauri.  Sheridan expresses to 
Garibaldi some of the concerns that added security drills have had to the 
population of the station.  The discussion is interrupted by Both G'Kar 
and 
Londo who separately are checking that both delegations have been given 
equally sized quarters among other important concerns.  Privately, G'Kar 
expresses to Na'Toth a desire for peace, since he had always hoped that 
the battle could be fought at a time of the Narn's choosing.  Both the 
Centauri and the Narn begin elaborate preparations of their respective 
delegations quarters.
</P>



<P>
Down Below, the T'llin where in hiding, but preparing for the visit of 
the 
Primes, a brother and sister who were the rulers of the T'll.  T'llin 
homeworld had been decimated and dominated by the Narns using the 
techniques they had learned from the Centauri.  The T'llin already 
onboard 
the station prepare to rent more suitable quarters for the arrival of 
their leader.
</P>


<P>
Garibaldi is training his new arrivals in hostage situations; Sergeant 
Kobayashi is one of the hostages.  The recruits fail miserably, and the 
'dead' Sergeant offers the advice that they should have used gas to knock 
everyone out before coming in.  Back at Command and Control (C&C), the 
situation is tense as usual, Ivanova is finding that the new officer, 
Larkin who is serving C&C just can't hack the work.  Larkin is somewhat 
mentally unstable from the internal monologue given and resents being 
talked down to and resolves to put Ivanova in her place.  Sheridan 
continues to be besieged by diplomatic requests of various sorts.  The 
Narn 
and the Centauri are discussing every issue from who should debark first 
to who should land first.  While shopping for goods for their leaders, 
the 
T'llin encounter Na'Toth.  Na'Toth attacks and ends up injured.  G'Kar 
charges Na'Toth with investigating the situation since the Narn do not 
want their treatment of the T'llin publicized.
</P>


<P>
Garibaldi is preparing the new recruits for their first shift at the 
customs area.  Each new recruit will be paired with an experienced 
security officer.  After depositing his charges, he meets Semana 
MacBride, 
she is wearing a Minbari like dress and her attractive appearance is 
calculated to draw the interest of men.  She is arguing with the security 
officers about entering the station with the sculpture that is to be 
donated to the station.  Garibaldi assists her in getting through customs 
and also finds himself concerned about her.  After she departs, he puts 
in 
a priority one request for her records from Earth Central.  MacBride is 
similarly 
concerned, and grateful, that she was able to encounter Garibaldi so 
early 
on to warn her of the dangers.  Ivanova is simultaneously relieved and 
more 
concerned by Larkin's clean bill of health.  She had required him to get 
a 
physical, but not a psych evaluation because she did not want to subject 
him to a telepathic scan.  Larkin returns to his quarters and sits down 
at 
his personal computer and resolves that it is time to put Ivanova in her 
place.
</P>


<P>
Garibaldi and Na'Toth argue about why she did not report the incident 
with 
T'llin immediately and explains that none are recorded as residents.  The 
computer record does not indicate that <EM>any</EM> T'llin have come 
aboard 
the station, but this contradicts Garibaldi and other's own experiences 
of 
seeing families of T'llin around.  In Semana's quarters, she feeds a 
bizarre plant-like creature named Tiko.  Tiko seems to have ability to 
disguise itself as a variety of objects successfully.
Na'Toth uses informers to try and get information about the T'llin 
downbelow, but in the process ends up their prisoner.
The furnishing Londo ended up ordering for himself rather than the 
delegates arrives and he seems very satisfied since the accountants seem 
hell bent on preventing him from enjoying his new stature.
</P>


<P>
The next morning, Ivanova finds a data crystal outside her door.  She 
immediately summons Garibaldi and they view it together.  The crystal 
suggests that her brother was a traitor on Io and shows "him" meeting 
with 
a spy on Io during the Earth-Minbari war.  The T'llin decide to release 
Na'Toth rather than kill her after some debate.  And, from Earth, 
Sheridan 
receives a communique that the president's niece will be visiting as a 
reporter.  At C&C, Ivanova arrives late, but composed, which upsets 
Larkin 
greatly.
</P>


<P>
Sheridan is selected to unveil Semana MacBride's statue.  Garibaldi 
returns 
to security to find G'Kar on the screen demanding the Garibaldi come to 
his quarters immediately.  G'Kar explains the assault on Na'Toth and 
demands that Garibaldi handle it immediately.  After some discussion, 
Garibaldi resolves to look into this by going down below alone and in 
disguise.  The T'llin manage to rent an office suite using a human agent 
to 
sign the deal.  
</P>


<P>
Garibaldi gets attacked down below and is rescued.  Franklin manages to 
patch him up a bit.  Garibaldi explains it could not have been the T'llin 
who have all completely disappeared.  Sheridan arrives in Medlab and says 
we have to talk.  Ivanova sets up a private interview with Larkin to try 
and assess what might be the problem.  Ivanova has no success in trying 
to 
get Larkin to talk in any significant way and ends up leaving him in 
tears.  Larkin resolves that he must really get her for talking to him 
like that.  Garibaldi brings the somewhat aggravated Captain up to speed 
on the situation with the T'llin.
</P>


<P>
Semana was all ready for the unveiling.  Semana applies her charms 
vigorously to the Narn ambassador, much to Na'Toth's chagrin.  Semana 
also 
dotes on Londo, also to Vir's chagrin.  Na'Toth and Vir 
exchange knowing glances sharing for a brief moment the same thought.  
Garibaldi takes a moment to approach MacBride and inquire about her 
previous misunderstanding with the law over an earlier art deal.  After 
being revealed, the statue has two T'llin sculpted on the side.  This 
causes G'Kar to loose his temper and Semana promises that they will be 
removed.  Sergeant Midori Kobayashi finally approaches Delenn and invites 
her to a tea ceremony.  Delenn asks Lennier to make inquiries about the 
sergeant.
</P>

<P>
After the party, Semana returns to the site and loosens the T'llin from 
the 
statue, the Primes step free and Semana provides Minbari disguises for 
them and some credits.  Lennier manages to get a hold of Garibaldi.  In 
discussing the statue he notes that the disappearance of the T'llin 
figures 
was due to the fact that they probably walked away.  Lennier advises 
Garibaldi to inquire with the lady, Semana, to find out more.  Lennier 
then proceeds to ask about the sergeant and the tea ceremony.  Garibaldi 
heartily endorses the sergeant, describing her as absolutely trustworthy. 
 
Semana takes a private moment with G'Kar to offer the Centauri Eye, see 
<A 
HREF="/lurk/guide/013.html">Signs and Portents</A>.  Semana shows G'Kar 
the Eye, actually 
it is her pet disguising itself as the eye.  G'Kar returns to his quarters 
excited and Na'Toth is appropriately skeptical that it could be the 
actual 
eye.
</P>


<P>
The next morning, Susan found yet another data crystal outside the door.  
This one she did not view, but gave directly to Garibaldi.  This one had 
a 
surprising ring of truth because it concerned actions of Vanya Ivanov 
during the war, and the ship shown was one destroyed in battle by the 
Minbari, but it could have been destroyed by sabotage perhaps.  
Londo is busy decorating his quarters with just two weeks left to the 
conference.  At Vir's expression of concern, Londo explains the Centauri 
have no intention of negotiating peace.  G'Kar meanwhile has obtained a 
diplomatic pouch with crystals showing Centauri attacks on Narn 
civilians.
</P>


<P>
Phina and Olorasin Primes, the brother and sister leaders of the T'llin, 
begin making their rounds of the diplomats aboard Babylon 5.  Phina, the 
brother, would like to do something to show the Narns he meant business.  
At his sister's request, they are visiting the ambassadors.  Delenn 
agrees 
to meet with them, but is unable to offer any help.  When they leave, she 
expresses her regrets to Lennier.  Lennier offers that he knows that if there 
is anything Delenn can do for them she will.  They visit Captain Sheridan 
who can only offer to relay their request to Earth Dome, and then head 
towards the Centauri ambassador's quarters.  G'Kar makes a call to a loan 
shark for money to purchase the Eye from Semana.  The phone's privacy 
screen is out of order and Londo is able to overhear the conversation.  

</P>


<P>
Back in C&C, Ivanova manages to piss Larkin off even further by thanking 
him for a job particularly well done.  His internal psychopathy 
transforms 
this into a deeper insult steeling his resolve to send another crystal.  
Londo approaches Semana in a burst of energy, wanting to talk with her.  
She agrees to have cocktails with Londo just prior to her dinner with 
G'Kar.
</P>


<P>
Londo arrives on time, but Semana was already there.  When Londo 
expresses 
his interest in the Eye obliquely, she is surprised since she can not 
understand how he would have found out about it.  Londo still is not 
certain what Semana has for sale but, given the importance of the Eye and 
the asking price, the thought comes to him.  A later call to Centauri 
Prime 
seems to confirm his suspicions that it is the Eye and that it was in 
fact 
perhaps missing from the Palace.  Semana puts the squeeze on G'Kar for 
the 
money sooner than G'Kar seems to be able to obtain it.  Prima Phina 
meanwhile was secretly trying to meet with the Centauri ambassador.  
While 
in the hall outside he removes his mask and Na'Toth comes upon him and 
kills him.  Even Garibaldi feels he must concede that this situation does 
not seem to have been provoked by Na'Toth, e.g. Phina could have been 
reaching for a weapon.
</P>


<P>
The next morning, Ivanova finds a third data crystal in her office.  
Garibaldi arrives and expresses some surprise that she even uses her 
office.
Garibaldi explains that they haven't yet proved the others forgeries, but 
something still feels wrong, scripted, about them.  She insists on seeing 
this crystal, it suggests that her father together with the Psi Corps 
doctor conspired to kill her mother.  Their discussion is interrupted by 
Sheridan who is upset that Garibaldi did not involve him in the T'llin 
death the previous evening.  Upon finding out about her brother's death, 
Olorasin breaks down.  The two were very closely linked twins, perhaps 
somewhat 
telepathically, and she collapses.
</P>


<P>
Londo and Semana finally meet so he can see the object, she shows him the 
Eye, cautioning against touching, allegedly for his own safety against 
being traced, but mostly to prevent the truth from coming out about her 
creature if it were to bite the Ambassador.  The creature shows up 
properly even under a scan as the Eye.  Londo immediately goes to 
Garibaldi and the two return to Semana's quarters with a search warrant.  
She shows papers for a miniature she had bought elsewhere and gets a good 
one over on Londo after she has managed to get Garibaldi convinced that 
at 
most she was trying to overcharge.  Meanwhile the T'llin are discovered 
in 
the rented office and will have to return to Down Below.
</P>


<P>
The Japanese tea ceremony prepared by Kobayashi was no small feat.  It 
turns out it is from a respect she gained for the Minbari when they 
spared 
her colony during the war.  Kobayashi also explains that she probably 
would not 
have been able to approach Delenn had she not undergone the 
transformation 
to the human-like form.  Delenn and Lennier leave feeling significantly 
lighter, younger and more refreshed.
</P>


<P>
Ivanova had spent hours going over personnel records looking at people 
who 
would have access to get at her office.  She intentionally saved Larkin's 
record for last.  She decides to check on whether any of the commanders 
who Larkin had previously responded to her message, she discovers that 
the 
messages were never sent.  Further research indicates that two have had 
serious psychological problems and the third gives less than a ringing 
endorsement.  The researchalso reveals that his hobby as a 
teenager 
was the creation of ultra-realistic vids, and that both of his 
parents 
were telepaths, but he wasn't.  Both realize that being an untalented kid at 
a 
Corps school would be especially cruel.  They decide that they must 
confront Larkin and Ivanova asks him to be present.
</P>


<P>
Cray who had previously helped the T'llin set up and was acting as 
G'Kar's 
loan shark, informed on the T'llin to G'Kar who immediately calls 
Garibaldi to round them up.  Olorasin awakens as the other T'llin begin 
to try 
and move her somewhere safer.  At that moment she resolves to carry out 
her brother's plan because she realizes that if they are to be turned 
over 
to the Narn eventually, the choice is to die now, or die later.
</P>


<P>
Wrapped in his own fantasies, Larkin reports to Ivanova's office.  She 
confronts him with the changed recommendation from a previous officer as 
well as the various incidents.  After he breaks up some about discussions 
of his parents, Ivanova orders him for a psych-evaluation and takes him 
off 
duty.  Garibaldi tells Larkin that he will be watching and Larkin is sent 
on his way.  Garibaldi explains that the suggestion of vid equipment was 
a 
security trick that Larkin fell for, and that there was no video 
equipment 
on the manifests.  Larkin begins losing it further because he thinks 
Garibaldi actually looked at his quarters.  Sheridan greets the 
president's niece, Chancy Clark.  Chancy immediately buttonholes Lennier 
for a tour of the station relieving Sheridan of the rather unpleasant 
duty.  While trying to deal with the T'llin, a call comes in of an 
officer 
down from PPG fire.  A guy in an EA uniform fired upon the security guard.
</P>


<P>
From the description, Garibaldi recognizes it is Larkin and puts out an 
APB.  Larkin is trying to get into the escape pods.  Ivanova immediately 
heads towards the pods on a hunch that it would be the best way for a 
civilian unfamiliar with the Starfuries to exit the station.  Ivanova 
and 
a technician arrive as Larkin gets himself into the airlock.  She and Hal 
try to explain the lock has malfunctioned and no pod is present.  No 
luck, 
Larkin eats the vacuum of space in just seconds.
</P>


<P>
After realizing that the various members of the press couldn't reach any 
sort of agreement on broadcast arrangements, Sheridan decides that it 
will 
be shown over video to the press from a remote camera.  Sheridan 
encounters 
Lennier waiting outside the press room and Lennier explains that he finds 
Chancy Clark's behavior confusing and intriguing.  Clark's niece 
ingratiates herself with Lennier and also observes to Sheridan that she 
will be attending in the arrival in person.  Sheridan discusses the 
Larkin 
situation with Ivanova and Garibaldi; he is upset that he was not 
involved 
with the situation.  Garibaldi explains the T'llin situation to G'Kar and 
says that they feel like they have gotten all of the T'llin rounded up 
into the brig.  G'Kar insists on seeing Semana in spite of Na'Toth's 
attempt to cancel the lunch meeting they had.  Up in C&C the arrival of a 
freighter with a friend brings an urgent message to Ivanova.  The friend 
tells Ivanova of a Centauri "fleet" of sorts near the jumpgate the Narns 
will be using.  Londo says he did not know of the "welcoming committee" 
and 
Sheridan has Ivanova take Alpha Wing to the gate to get the Centauri away 
from there.  The remaining T'llin capture Cray and recruit him for their 
plan demanding maps and security codes for the station.
</P>


<P>
Alpha Wing arrives at the Centauri yacht fleet and attempts to contact 
them.  They seem like a bunch of bozo Centauri looking for trouble or a 
good time.  Londo's cousin Sodev is on board one of the yachts and Londo 
himself consents to having them blown out of the sky.  G'Kar meets with 
Semana and explains that he has obtained most of the asking price, she 
rebuffs the offer because she does not want to be traced and wants to be 
off the station as soon as possible.  Before they can negotiate further, 
Na'Toth drags the ambassador away.  Mollari arrive immediately and Semana 
seems ready to sell to him.   The Primes' plan is to conceal themselves 
in 
the docking bay in hibernation till the delegates arrive.  Ivanova's 
group 
uses some trickery to get the Centauri to leave without a fight.
</P>


<P>
Garibaldi realizes that Olorasin is missing and sets off to find out her 
whereabouts as the reception is getting ready to start.  Semana dupes 
Londo with a cake in a Chinese-style puzzle box and exits the station 
quickly on the last 
transport out.  All of the ambassadors except Kosh are present for the 
reception and security is continuing to look around for any problems in 
the docking area.  The two delegations enter the docking area 
simultaneously and head down to the platform to be greeted.  In moments, 
the hull breach warnings sounded and air began escaping.  The delegates 
and guests crowded into the hull breach area to wait out the problems.  
Additionally, breach doors came down sealing the docking area from the 
rest 
of the station.  After keeping the camera out, they closed the breach 
area.
</P>


<P>
The T'llin had come out of hibernation in their fake Earthforce uniforms 
with PPGs in hand.  Olorasin announces that they are her prisoners and 
Sheridan spots one with a bomb rigged to a dead man's switch.  Garibaldi 
determines that the communications to the docking area have been disabled 
and readies his team for action.  In the docking bay, the Centauri are 
confused as to why the T'llin do not consider them friends, but Olorasin 
explains that it is because they taught the Narns to be the way they are. 
 
Olorasin explains that they too have learned, but perhaps more quickly 
than the Narn and are willing to kill everyone to make their point.
</P>


<P>
Sheridan asks Olorasin what she wants, she explains they want the Narn to 
leave their world.  Delenn attempts to intervene, with little apparent 
effect.  Seeing that arguing was going nowhere, the delegations at 
Olorasin's insistence begin discussing peace as they sit waiting.  
Olorasin rather effectively cuts through the posturing between the 
parties 
as Garibaldi's team comes through the outer hull into the docking bay.  
Na'Toth makes a foolish attempt to change the situation which results in 
her being shot by a PPG.  As Olorasin hovers over Na'Toth ready to kill 
perhaps because of the murder of her brother, Garibaldi's team becomes 
ready to operate and their charges go off on the breach door.
</P>


<P>
At that moment, Olorasin decides to surrender and orders her troops to 
give up
their weapons.  The T'llin with the dead man's switch lets it go and Midori 
throws herself against the T'llin, sparing the others' lives at the cost of 
her own.  Sheridan expresses some thoughts to the Narn about the T'llin 
and getting out of their world.  He also explains that the remaining 
Prime 
will be granted asylum and Delenn explains that the Centauri have agreed 
to 
be the second sponsor.  Delenn and Sheridan leave hand in hand to discuss 
the T'llin situation suggesting that Delenn may be able to offer some aid.
</P>


<P>
As the officers make a toast to Midori, Garibaldi explains that Delenn 
had 
offered to write her family, calling it an obligation.
</P>

<UL>
<LI>
Who attacked Garibaldi down below?
</LI>
<LI>
How did Larkin manage to gain so much access to the systems and create 
such 
sophisticated forgeries?  The book suggests a high level of experience on 
his part, but also hints that there may be more back doors in Earth 
Alliance 
systems than are readily apparent.
</LI>

<LI>
How did Lennier know the figurines of the T'llin had walked away?  Do the 
Minbari have more knowledge of T'llin physiology and their ability to 
hibernate, or is it just a suspicion?
</LI>

<LI>
Having G'Kar make the call to the loan shark from a public phone seems to 
be a bit too convenient.  Why would G'Kar use a public phone to make the 
call?
</LI>

<LI>
Was the Eye actually stolen from Centauri Prime or is Londo being played 
for a complete fool?  The Centauri already have lost this valuable object 
once before, to loose it again does not seem that unthinkable.
</LI>

</UL>


<H2><A NAME="AN">Analysis</A></H2>


<UL>
<LI>
The Narn may not have had significant space capabilities prior to 
encountering the Centauri.  Why though when the Centauri met the humans 
much more recently, did they not enslave the planet?  This suggests that 
the Centauri have been in decline for quite some time.

<LI>
This novel is set in 2259, the second season, prior to the destruction 
of the Narn Homeworld
</LI>
<LI>
This book portrays Garibaldi and Sheridan as not entirely getting along, 
it 
is unclear what this is based upon, but is not entirely out of character 
either, at the least Sheridan and Garibaldi do not have the relationship 
that Sinclair and Garibaldi did.
