<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>The Enemy Within</H3>

<P>
Babylon 5, designed to be a place of peace in a troubled universe, has 
erupted with riots as visiting cultures clash and passions explode.  
Security chief Garibaldi must use all his skills to quell the violence 
between races.  But the troubles escalate as terrifying nightmares 
plague 
everyone on board from Captain Sheridan to Vorlon Ambassador Kosh.  It 
seems as if some "force" is touching them all...
</P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>The Touch of Your Shadow, The Whisper of Your Name</H3>

<P>
Then an alien presence appears.  A long, twisting band of green light 
<EM>nine million miles long</EM> stretches out against the darkness of 
space on a collision course with Babylon 5.  Since it remains invisible 
to 
computer sensors, some are calling it an illusion, others are calling it 
an 
evil life force.  Still others are calling it God.  Now it is up to 
Captain Sheridan and Garibaldi to find out, risking there lives, and 
perhaps their souls, to venture forth among the stars to meet the 
unknown...
</P>

<H2><A NAME="SY">Synopsis</A></H2>


<P>
The novel opens with Garibaldi sitting on a transport near the Euphrates 
sector jump gate.  A friend who owes him from a World Series bet
is taking him back home on a rickety transport.  Almost as soon as they 
arrive, the friend offers to buy a drink.  After Garibaldi refuses, his 
link beeps, ending any thoughts of peace and quiet.  Garibaldi reports to 
Brown deck as request.
</P>


<P>
The Consortium of Live Eaters had gotten down to Brown deck and started 
rioting.  Meanwhile a fight was breaking out at the Trinocular Film 
Festival and the Life in Transition group was starting a fight in the 
Main 
Hall.  The LITs as they were called had created quite a stir, their 
belief that life was just a "mistake," led to a large counter protest 
outside the hall.  Garibaldi convinces them to return to their conference 
room and posts several guards to keep them there.
</P>



<P>
Garibaldi finally gets a chance to meet with Sheridan who apologizes for 
bringing the Security Chief's leave to such an abrupt end.  Ivanova 
arrives 
and Sheridan explains to them how the entire station has been erupting 
in 
violence.  Also, a  number of people have been having particularly 
violent 
nightmares.  Dr. Franklin arrives late and explains that he hasn't been 
able to find a source for the disturbances.  Garibaldi reiterates the 
request to lock the conferees up, but Sheridan explains that a number of 
the ambassadors have complained. (See <A HREF="#NO">Notes</A>.)  After 
ending the meeting, Garibaldi stays and asks the Captain if he has been 
having the nightmares too.  Sheridan admits to having them without saying 
more.
</P>


<P>
Psi Corps member Martina Coles attempts to sleep and she feels 
<EM>something</EM> and yet nothing reaching out to her.  Kosh stands in 
contemplation as something shakes "Kosh to the core of [its] alien 
being."  (See <A HREF="#NO">Notes</A>.)  Ambassador Delenn, dreaming, 
finds a curved 
scimitar in her hand.  A voice cries out to her, warning her to defend 
herself or die.  The voice belongs to Sheridan, who kills her all the 
while talking about the end of a time for talking.  (See <A 
HREF="#NO">Notes</A>.)
G'Kar dreams about destroying the Centauri ships as a hero in war.  But 
the Centauri, specifically Londo use a new kind of weapon to disable the 
Narn and prevent victory.  Garibaldi  finds himself in a shuttle with 
Ivanova.  The two argue about the controls with him finally attempting 
the 
landing.  As they were about to make it, he realizes a battle is underway 
and he wakes screaming 'No!' and covered in sweat.  His link beeps, 
trouble 
in Security Central among other locations.
</P>


<P>
After breaking up a fight between two of his officers by throwing them in 
the Brig, Garibaldi goes to handle the Fermi's Angels.  The Angels are 
motorcyclists in space.  Meanwhile, Sheridan plans a meeting along with 
Ambassadors 
for the next day about the incidents on the station.  The invitation also 
includes Coles who Sheridan feels may have information.  Then Ivanova 
calls from the observation dome asking him to come see something.
</P>


<P>
The Worm is 9 million miles long and half a million miles wide but aside 
from a green luminescence, it does not show up on anything but through 
direct observation.  Sheridan orders a science team to investigate and 
they begin planning.  He also contacts Earth Dome and the president's 
aide 
already knows about the vent.  Sheridan is surprised that they are 
willing 
to admit that they have a mole on the inside.
</P>


<P>
Two things touched Martina Coles' mind.  One was that strange thing 
that had brushed across the other day.  The other was an alien.  A 
Vorlon, 
Kosh.  After shaking off the shivers and cold sweat that the feeling had 
brought on she goes to the ambassador's quarters.  She asks him to stay 
out of her mind and he responds "You are . . . not ready to hear me."  
They "argue" a bit about whether there will be a time when she is ready 
to 
hear, but Martina flees the quarters in afraid that continuing will not 
get 
her anywhere and that she might loose her cool.  She finally makes it 
back 
to her quarters in a state of terror.
Garibaldi manages to handle the Angels by convincing them that he is 
'hip'. 
And they give him a jacket and offer to give him a ride.
</P>


<P>
At the briefing the next day, the table was crowded.  Ivanova had already 
positioned herself next to the door so that after Londo and G'Kar 
entered 
they would not leave and would stay at the table.  The science team that 
Ivanova was organizing had not yet left.  And Sheridan tried to get any 
information about the incidents.  Kosh was of course absent from the 
meeting. Martina Coles balks at reading aliens for Sheridan in an attempt 
to figure anything out.  She explains that her temporary contract has a 
clause excusing her from such requests.  Garibaldi makes a reference to 
the 
alleged bomb planted in Londo by saying 'Boo!' and that calms Londo down 
again.  After the meeting adjourns, Delenn talks to Sheridan and warns him 
that the station may be in worse danger based on her dreams.  She warns 
that the races may all turn on each other and explains her dream in which 
he tries to kill her.
</P>



<P>
In the Observation Dome, Ivanova is surprised that the Worm is moving 
towards the station at a rapid click.  The Worm would arrive within 
forty-eight hours.  Lennier meanwhile was beginning to be affected by the 
Worm.  When Coles accidentally brushed against him in the hall, he began to 
simmer angrily.  Returning to his quarters he smashed a mirror and began 
to 
recall his dreams of roaming the halls with a spear and a loincloth.  His 
goal, targeting the non-Minbari.  The blood from his knuckles brought 
unconsciousness and sleep.
</P>


<P>
Franklin was under a tremendous amount of stress from the influx of minor 
injuries as well as the concern about the unknown plague that was 
afflicting the station.  Garibaldi meanwhile also had his hands full with 
chaos throughout the station.  He attempts to break into Coles' quarters, 
but she arrives before he enters.  They argue briefly and she passes out. 
 
Garibaldi offers some aid and seems convinced that Coles is at the least 
not working against them.  
</P>


<P>
Sheridan and Garibaldi discuss Coles and Garibaldi thinks she knows 
something but is too frightened to discuss it.  Sheridan also explains 
that 
Earth Central is afraid of the Worm but unwilling to assist with sending 
troops. Back in Command and Control, Ivanova monitors the large science 
probe they sent to the Worm.  Nothing.  Not even video. They agree to 
prepare another probe, this one with a weapon to give off a little shock.
</P>


<P>
Sheridan sleeps fitfully.  He dreams of the Minbari Grey Council.  They 
ask what he fears.  Delenn enters the circle from behind and asks if 
Sheridan fears her.  The council disappeared and in darkness he found 
himself staring into a lit mirror, his face Minbari.
</P>


<P>
Again the Worm invades Martina Coles' mind and she screams in terror.  And 
then a dream, actually a memory comes.  Psi Corps had let a Narn come to 
her 
when she was sixteen to breed.  Psi Corps hoped that it would be more 
powerful than anything they had ever produced.  Martina ran away and 
nothing was ever said of it again.  When she awakens, Martina reaches out 
to Kosh and asks to speak to him.
</P>


<P>
Sleep deprivation is hitting the command staff badly.  Franklin has 
created a vile looking sleep pill that will enable a few hours of sleep 
without interruption by dreams.  Delenn informs Sheridan that her world is 
now on full alert since they are afraid the Worm is a prelude to war.  
Sheridan gives Delenn one of the pills to assist her in sleep.  As she 
falls asleep in his office she says she could never kill him, and 
Sheridan 
responds with the same.
</P>



<P>
Three hours of truly restful sleep was a great aid to Garibaldi who 
quickly 
prepared to go underground in search of the transmitter that was giving 
Earth Dome the inside track on station events.  But, his investigation 
does not turn up anything immediately except that black marketers from 
Down Below
have already begun to leave the station out of fear.
</P>


<P>
The Reverend Bobby James Galazy of the Universal Church of Solar 
Illumination has found the ideal opportunity to stir up further debate.  
He calls the Worm a chance to drive the heathen from Babylon 5.  He 
claims 
that only humans are made in God's image and the others must be destroyed.
</P>


<P>
Meanwhile, a Centauri ship is heading towards the Worm.  With Londo's 
help 
they manage to get the ship to return to the station with only minimal 
difficulty.  The command staff agrees that everyone should be involved 
and 
share in the results when the station sends out its shuttle later.
</P>


<P>
Kosh tells Coles she is ready and to come to him.  But Coles is already 
having second thoughts, but finally relents and heads towards Kosh.  Kosh 
then opens a portion of his mind to her, revealing what he has determined 
about the Worm.
</P>


<P>
Ivanova is called upon to meet with the Consortium of Live Eaters and 
procure the return of a Centauri who had been abducted.  They are a race 
that live in an acidic atmosphere and were not visited by members of the 
staff.  After donning a special environmental suit she enters their 
chambers.  They explain that they are preparing for termination of their 
community during the "Feast and Dissolution Ceremony" and the Centauri 
entered "willingly."  They agree to return the Centauri and proceed with 
their ceremony without the Centauri.  Ivanova watches them consume 
themselves in just a few brief moments.
</P>


<P>
Hilton Dowd, Clark's aide, explains to Sheridan how displeased the 
President is with Sheridan's responses thus far.  Dowd mentions that 
military action is being considered.  When Sheridan explains that 
anything 
like that should wait till after the manned shuttled expedition, Dowd 
explains he already knows of that and is expecting the results.
</P>


<P>
Ivanova and her scientific team including several techs and a Dr. Creighton 
Laramie of Barker Industries on Earth approach the Worm.
As the shuttle draws closer, 
sensors turned up nothing.  As Dr. Laramie described it, there is just the 
illusion of brightness.  Ivanova contacts Sheridan before they agree that 
the shuttle will go through the Worm.  As Sheridan agrees, one of the 
techs comes out like a loony with a spanner in hand.   Another tech 
explains that a third tech is already badly injured and they need to 
return 
to the station to save his life.  Laramie puts up a small fight about the 
need to return to the station, but relents.
</P>


<P>
When they get back to the station things have gotten out of control.  
Ivanova is sent to try and handle the bikers while Garibaldi tries to 
handle a situation between the Narn and Centauri in the Zocalo.  After 
locating G'Kar, Garibaldi heads to the Zocalo.  Mollari is already dead 
drunk and next to one of Garibaldi's guards in the Zocalo.  
</P>


<P>
Ivanova has little success with the bikers till Garibaldi checks in via 
link and he convinces them to cut her some slack.  They take off to come 
help Garibaldi in the Zocalo.  Meanwhile, Garibaldi is pinned down with 
G'Kar but he notices that Mollari had been kidnapped by the Narn.  G'Kar 
attempts to help them but given the general chaos little seems likely.
</P>



<P>
Once again Ambassador Delenn's dreams are intruded upon by the image of a 
fight 
with Sheridan.  This time the setting is a joust in which Sheridan 
finally 
kills her as she pleads for him not to take her life.
</P>


<P>
Coles awakens to Garibaldi who has brought her back from Kosh's quarters. 
 
He gives her one of the sleeping pills.  When Coles awakens, Sheridan and 
Garibaldi question her about what she learned from Kosh.  She says she 
learned nothing, just that it felt like a ghost of something.
</P>


<P>
Sheridan resolves to speak to Kosh and goes to visit him.  Kosh explains 
that Coles saw a fragment and that he is studying the worm, but can tell 
Sheridan nothing.  As Sheridan pushes Kosh, he senses that the Worm is 
affecting Kosh also and Kosh finally withdraws asking Sheridan to leave 
firmly.
</P>


<P>
In one of the docking bays, Ivanova is trying to keep people from leaving 
the station.  The crowd's mob mentality overwhelmed Ivanova and they 
stormed towards the freighter.   The freighter attempts to take off, but 
the only thing that it succeeds in doing is rupturing itself, the hull and 
taking a number of lives with it.
</P>


<P>
Reverend Bobby James Galaxy continues to dream up his Final Plan.  Dreams 
of destroying the aliens.  Mass destruction, which he truly believed in.  
Franklin found that even with the pills, dreams came, terrible dreams.  
Him 
in Medlab being the subject of study.  Franklin contacts Sheridan and 
explains that the pills can not be used repeatedly or that perhaps the
ever-increasing proximity of the Worm is reducing their effectiveness.
</P>


<P>
Garibaldi was having no luck locating Londo, but he did discover that 
Laramie was the spy.  Sheridan has Laramie put in the brig but before 
long 
Earth Central is on the comm with a pardon for Laramie.
</P>


<P>
Lennier begins acting out his dreams and puts on a loincloth and enters 
the 
halls of the station and begins attacking people.  In Command and 
Control, 
Earthforce fighters have entered the sector through the jump gate and are 
heading directly towards the Worm.  Sheridan contacts Earth and demands 
an 
explanation and asks that the ships be called back.  Sheridan heads off 
with the station's Starfuries to intercept the Earthforce fighters and 
deter them from attacking the Worm.  Through bullying, Sheridan is able 
to 
get them to head back to the station with him.
</P>


<P>
Then a jump point opens and a Centauri battle cruiser emerges near the 
Worm.  To make matters worse, renegade Narn fighters led by G'Kar arrive 
and begin a space battle.  (See <A HREF="#NO">Notes</A>.)  The three 
underground fighters continue the attack on the Centauri despite 
Sheridan's request that the come back to the station.  G'Kar is captured 
by the Centauri creating a dual hostage standoff.  But, the Centauri 
battle cruiser is also crippled from the battle.
</P>


<P>
Sheridan has Garibaldi bug Laramie's lab before allowing Laramie to be 
released.  Garibaldi also discovers that as yet Laramie has discovered 
nothing of value.  The two hostage holding parties each make demands for 
release of their respective hostages and then set simultaneous execution 
times.
</P>


<P>
As the Worm drew closer, Coles lay in a fetal position trying to ignore 
the memories inside her mind.  Lennier sat making weapons like a madman.  
Delenn locked herself in her quarters and fell into nightmares in which 
she and Sheridan battled over and over.  Sheridan saw himself transformed 
into a Minbari.  Everywhere, chaos.  Reverend Galaxy awakens with a plan.
</P>


<P>
Ivanova explains that a mad man, Galaxy, together with the Fermi Angels,
was planning to blow up Babylon 5 
as the Worm passes over.  Garibaldi goes to Laramie and after some 
arguing, Laramie admits him.  Laramie agrees to help.
</P>



<P>
Lennier and Garibaldi end up in a tussle that results in Garibaldi being 
stabbed.  Delenn summons Sheridan to the garden where she attempts to 
kill 
him, first offering a weapon to the Captain.  Sheridan is possessed with 
anger and begins to slash at her and then the power went out.
</P>


<P>
The Worm passed through the station.  The power surge met Laramie's 
counter 
surge and all power went out.  After the worm passed, the Centauri agree 
to release G'Kar for Mollari and vice versa.  The station and the people 
on it begin to return to their senses, somewhat embarrassed about what 
they 
had done.
</P>


<P>
As some things begin to return to normalcy, there are apologies for bad 
judgments.  And a final meeting about the Worm.  Little was learned;
Laramie, Coles, and Kosh each offer nothing of substance.  Garibaldi is 
given free reign to deal with all of the resulting conflicts and claims 
and basically locks all the various parties in a conference room until 
they can settle the difficulties.
</P>


<P>
The book ends inside Kosh's mind.  The alien had sensed a presence, "What 
are you...?", Kosh had asked.  And a reply came as the Worm receded, 
"What 
are you?"
</P>

<H2><A NAME="UQ">Unanswered Questions</A></H2>


<UL>
<LI>
What was the Worm?  Anything that a Vorlon can't even comprehend has to 
send some shivers down ones spine.</LI>

<LI>
What does Psi Corps hope to gain through breeding Narns and Humans?  Could 
it have happened given the Narn's continued desire for telepaths as seen 
in many episodes?
</LI>


</UL>

<H2><A NAME="AN">Analysis</A></H2>


<UL>
<LI>The very suggestion that there are phenomenon in the universe that 
the 
Vorlons can not even comprehend is a nice touch.  All too often, powerful 
races seem to be able to comprehend everything.  This portrayal of the 
Vorlons suggests that they are creatures just like the humans, only more 
advanced.</LI>

<LI>The willingness of Clark to show his hand in this book fits 
remarkably 
well with where the Third Season has gone.  This foreshadows the level to 
which Clark has ruthlessly maintained a grip on power through plants of 
loyal followers.</LI>

<LI>One does have to wonder if Clark is at all involved in any of the 
groups that we have seen in early episodes such as the Home Guard.</LI>


<LI>
The dream where Sheridan sees himself as a Minbari is rather interesting 
in light of the suggestion that some or many Humans carry Minbari souls.  
This may suggest that Sheridan, like Sinclair, has one.
</LI>

<LI>
The suggestion that Kosh is a powerful telepath is unsurprising, but the 
ambassador's ability to communicate at such a distance seems rather 
remarkable given what we know about telepathy among the other races and 
the need for some physical proximity.  Although, Ironheart, <A 
HREF="/lurk/guide/006.html">Mind War</A>, had reached a level where 
contact and proximity were no longer necessary.
</LI>

</UL>


<H2><A NAME="NO">Notes</A></H2>

<UL>
<LI>
The book refers to G'Kar as an ambassador, given the alleged time setting 
of the book this is inaccurate.  However, if you just assume that 
ambassador is being used as shorthand for head of the Narns, the book 
works.  The setting is supposed to be early 2260, before <A 
HREF="/lurk/guide/047.html">A Day in the Strife</A>, which is the episode 
where G'Kar's position as leader of the Narn is challenged.
</LI>

<LI>
The book refers to Delenn as being a member of the Grey Council still.  
This was not true during the time setting of the book, but it perhaps 
should be interpreted to mean that someone of high birth or position in 
Minbari society does not typically wield weapons.  But that notion is 
also 
contradicted by Delenn's fighting scene with Marcus in
<a href="/lurk/guide/045.html">"Matters of Honor."</a>
</LI>


<LI>
The arrival of Narn fighters seems implausible given the time setting and 
the probable use of any remaining fighters to attack the Centauri back 
home.
</LI>

</UL>

<h2><a name="JS">JMS Speaks</a></h2>
<ul>

   <li> Gerald, the reality is that as humans, we're all flawed. 
	Errors and inconsistencies in something as big as a novel, written by
	someone who doesn't work on the show, isn't involved in it day to day,
	are gong to slip through. That is inevitable.  I try to keep track of
	it all, read as much as I can, to keep it in line, but the *only* way
	to keep it 100% canon is to invest all the time I currently spend doing
	that on the series, which is a 24 hour a day job.

	<p>
	A writer comes in, has a notion for a book, or gets one
	assigned to him; the writer then goes away and around that notion
	writes 100,000 words or so.  I don't see it again until the finished
	manuscript comes in, almost always at the last minute.  The *only* way
	to make sure that every word of that is canon is to work hand in glove
	with the writer through every page. The reason the B5 series is as
	consistent as it is, is because that's what I do, day in and day out.

	<p>
	So the broad strokes are always going to be pretty much
	consistent with the series; of the next batch, we'll probably do some
	backstory in the B5 universe taken from my notes.  But some of the
	details will always be off a bit, because you're turning the work over
	to the hands of others.  There is simply no other way to do it short of
	my adding Editor and Publisher to my list of hats.

   <li> It's either their ignorance or they don't care...but you're
	correct, in the B5 universe you can't have two races interbreeding just
	like that. (In fact, I seem to recall pointing this out in my notes on
	the manuscript; odd that it hasn't been attended to, from what you're
	saying.  I can only assume that it slipped between the cracks.)

   <li> Initially Dell kept going for one-word titles, and I generally don't
	like that, so I told them to have the writers come up with more
	interesting titles.
