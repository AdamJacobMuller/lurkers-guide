<li>
I think book 2 is terrific as well, maybe in some ways better than 1 because
though it's not as epic, it really makes the Psi Corps come alive in some
nifty
ways.

<p>
I haven't seen 3 yet, but it should be a real kick.

<p>
The technomage trilogy, at this point, may work out to be my favorite, given
how much of the B5 storyline it interweaves.

<p>
<li>
<em>Why should we buy a book to learn about things that should have been
covered in the series?</em>

<P>
1) The B5 series was never about the Psi Corps, it was about the station and
the people who live there.

<p>
2) Should the show have told everything there was about IPX, the Psi Corps,
EarthDome, and all of the various institutions involved?  Show me any series
ever created that can do that.

<p>
3) The Psi Corps books cover over a hundred years of history, and Bester's
final fate comes years after the events of the B5 storyline.  There is NO WAY
to include all of that in any one series.  You are asking the impossible, and
complaining because we cannot do what simply cannot be done by any series,
ever, anywhere, ever created.
