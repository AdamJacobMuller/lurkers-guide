The
<a href="http://www.tvguide.com/tv/magazine/970630/index.sml">July 5, 1997</a>
issue of
<a href="http://www.tvguide.com/">TV Guide</a>
features B5 on its cover.  (The article contains major spoilers for
future episodes; tread with caution.)

<p>
This is an ideal opportunity for fans to show their support.  Like any other
for-profit publication, TV Guide's coverage is based in part on
what they think will sell more magazines.  If they put "Baywatch" on the cover
and sell twice as many copies as usual, they'll tend to do more "Baywatch"
stories thereafter.

<p>
We can use that simple bit of economics to increase B5's coverage in the future.
As TV Guide is the most popular entertainment magazine in the US, any
increase in B5 coverage will likely prompt more people to try the show out,
and that boost in ratings will improve the chances
of additional TNT movie orders, of the proposed
<a href="/lurk/guide/113.html">spinoff series,</a>
and maybe even a B5 theatrical movie.
Encouraging more TV Guide coverage is probably the best-leveraged thing fans
can do right now to help keep the show going.

<p>
To that end, I'd like to propose that every B5 fan go out and buy two copies
of the magazine when it's released.  Spread the word; if you have friends
who watch the show but aren't on the net, ask them to do the same.  If
nothing else, a B5 cover story in a major national publication is a good
collector's item, given how spotty B5's press coverage has historically been.

<p>
Every science-fiction show in danger in the last five years has spawned a big
letter-writing campaign.  By now, it seems to me, the networks and studios
must be pretty used to it: produce an SF show, get a bunch of fan letters,
like clockwork.  But to my knowledge, no fan campaign has yet had the
audacity to put its money where its mouth is.  A TV Guide-buying campaign,
if it's successful, might even get some press coverage in its own right.

<p>
Let's give it a try and see what kind of waves we can make!

<p>
<b>Update:</b> The preview in the June 28 issue confirms that there'll be B5
coverage.  It says, "There's big news about the sci-fi series Babylon 5, and TV
Guide goes on the set of TNT's upcoming B5 movie to get info straight
from the show's stars and producers."
