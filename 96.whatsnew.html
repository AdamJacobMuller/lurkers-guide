	A glitch in all the credits pages has been fixed; this should make
	the credits look a lot better under Microsoft Internet Explorer.
	(For the technically minded, the problem was that the alignment
	from the preceding &lt;p&gt; tag was being carried over into a

	A new introduction to the Background section of the episode guide
	for season four is in place.  (Select the "Background" link from an

	Lots of little changes all over the Guide today.  I took the day off
	work to spend plowing through some of my E-mail backlog.  I've
	gotten through 220 messages so far; sadly, that's not even half the
	backlog, but I'll attempt to catch up before season four begins.
	Please bear with me if you notice something is out of date -- it's
	almost undoubtedly on my to-do list already, and more mail about it
	will only slow me down further!

	Some of you have noted that the Guide isn't using inline JPEGs any
	more.  They'll be back!  The method I was using to choose between
	JPEGs and GIFs turned out to be too heavy a load on the server.
	Luckily, we'll be installing a faster machine in the next couple
	of weeks.  And, spare time permitting, I'll shortly be implementing
	a more efficient way of doing the picture selection.  The JPEGs
	will return when the first of those two things happens.  Thanks
	for your patience.

	Hyperion has moved to a new ISP yet again.  If you see that your
	browser is listing this server as "http://199.165.129.193/", your
	browser is keeping old host addresses around longer than it's
	supposed to.  You'll want to restart it at some point (though

	We have started putting JPEG versions of some of our inline images
	in place alongside the GIF versions.  Our server should automatically
	feed you an image type your browser can handle; if you find you're
	getting garbage or a broken-image icon where you used to get a
	picture, please let us know.  The change will be an ongoing process
	over the next several weeks.  JPEG provides significant savings in
	file size, and thus download time, for some images; it also looks
	much better in many cases, especially on 16-million-color displays.

	<p>
	Not all images will be JPEGged, just those that benefit either in
	appearance or size.  That means most of the navigational icons will
	remain GIFs even for people who can handle inline JPEGs.

	<p>
	This feature will probably not be available on mirror sites, which
	will continue to serve up GIF images.
