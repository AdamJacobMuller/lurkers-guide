	The following note from Dean Treadway at TNT may be cause for relief
	for some viewers:

	<blockquote>
	For those of you who are not getting the final four episodes of the
	fourth season because your local station dropped B5 in October, we'll
	see what we can do about getting those final four on some 1 am-5 am
	slot sometime before Jan 19, but there's a strong possibility that it
	might not happen.  No promises. You'll hear about it if it happens,
	through the TNT/B5 webpage, due to launch in early November.

	The episode guide and synopsis screenshots are now in JPEG format
	rather than GIF format.  In most cases, this should result in
	improved load time (JPEG typically produces smaller output than GIF
	for these types of images) and, for people with 16-bit (64K) or higher
	color depth, much nicer-looking images.

	the change will happen sometime in the next week.  Images that work
	better in GIF format, such as buttons, will stay GIF.

	The station list on the
	<a href="reference/airtimes.shtml">Air Times</a>
	page now contains hypertext links, mostly to TV station Web pages.
	The textual
	<a href="/lurk/ftp/b5tvlist.txt">station list</a>
	is now derived from the Air Times page rather than the other way around.

	Many people have written to point out that the guide page for
	<a href="guide/071.html">"The Long Night"</a>
	doesn't have much material yet.  I'm getting over a nasty flu; the
	page will be updated when I've recovered.  Thank you for your patience.

	More on the cookies as described in January 8's entry.  It occurred to
	me today that to implement the feature, it wasn't necessary
	to have the Web server set cookies on every hit, which unfortunately
	was my only choice given the server software we're running.  It will
	suffice to simply have the per-user what's new page, a CGI script,
	do it.  Folks who refuse cookies will be relieved to see that they
	no longer have to do it for every image on every page (though I
	consider Netscape's behavior in that regard a pretty serious
	user-interface flaw, and Internet Explorer is no better.)

	We've started running a new version of our Web server software.
	You may have noticed that the Guide is now setting cookies
	in your browser; there's a reason for that.  I plan to use them to
	put together a "What's new since your last visit" page, so you can
	come to the site and jump instantly to all the latest material.  To
	do that, the Guide needs to distinguish you from other users, and
	cookies are the most convenient way to do it.  About 95% of the
	Guide's users use browsers that support cookies, according to my
	most recent statistics.

	<p>
	Some concern has been expressed that they'll be used to collect
	demographic information.  In fact, I have no use for that; I can't
	accept ads or otherwise use the Guide to make money since it's not
	officially sanctioned by Warner Bros.  To the extent that I eventually
	do any usage tracking beyond keeping track of the time of your last
	visit, it'll be to see what the most common paths through the Guide are
	so I can make it more convenient for frequent users.  (But detailed
	tracking like that isn't even on my to-do list yet; just the fancy
	what's-new feature is plenty of work.)

	The long-overdue
	<a href="universe/setting-4.html">Universe pages</a>
	for season four are online.  They should still be considered works
	in progress (there are a couple portraits missing, for example)
	but they should be helpful for new viewers.
