<h2><a name="philosophy">The Philosophy</a></h2>

<a href="creators.html#jms">JMS'</a>
main criteria for a good science fiction television series include that it
must be good science fiction <em>and</em> good television;
it must be geared towards adults, not kids (one slogan
on the set is, "No Cute
Kids, No Cute Robots.  Ever!") doing for science fiction what <cite>Hill Street
Blues</cite> did for police shows.  It must be done on a reasonable
budget and it should look like nothing ever seen on TV.  And to make it a
series, it should not be just individual stories (alien attack/ possession/
misunderstanding of the week) -- the stories should be part of an overall
larger story, but still watchable each week as a separate chapter.

<p>
In keeping with those ideals, a
<a href="/lurk/universe/five-year-overview.html">five year storyline</a>
(the "arc") has been planned
as if the show were a five year miniseries.  Events have been planned for each
season, which will tell a larger story over time.  There is plenty of room for
individual stories within each season and each episode can stand alone,
though certain episodes (which JMS calls "WHAM" episodes) are pivotal to the
big picture -- for example,
<a href="/lurk/guide/013.html">"Signs and Portents"</a>
from season one.

<p>
One common complaint about science-fiction shows (and TV in general) is that
fan input falls on deaf ears.  Not so Babylon 5.  JMS participates in online
discussions in several places, such as
<a href="/lurk/ftp/CompuServe/">CompuServe,</a>
<a href="/lurk/ftp/GEnie/">GEnie,</a>
and
<a href="/lurk/ftp/Usenet/">Usenet,</a>
actively soliciting discussions and thoughtful criticism about the episodes
and the show in general.  Some of this online discussion even goes onto a
"Best of the Nets" bulletin board on a wall in the production offices, where
it's read by many of the staff.

<p>
In fact, since the airing of the pilot, fan input has had
<a href="/lurk/resources/fans.html#effect">visible effects</a>
on the show.

<p>
All freelance scripts have the original writer as the sole credit.  Contrary
to prevailing practice in Hollywood, any
rewrites or additions (such as a "B" plot or additional scenes) by Babylon 5
staff do not add to the writing credit.  This allows freelancers to
get full royalties for the episodes they write.
