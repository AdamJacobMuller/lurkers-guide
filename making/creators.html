The show was created by <b>J. Michael Straczynski</b> (JMS), who is
executive producer along with Doug Netter.  It has been in
development since 1987.

<p>
JMS has been involved with genre television for many
years, as story editor and writer for the Twilight Zone TV series (syndicated
version),
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/6213/index.html">Captain Power,</a>
and the animated The Real Ghostbusters.  He has also
written for Jake and the Fatman and Murder,  She Wrote.  JMS has also had
many published short stories, an anthology, and  two fantasy/horror novels.
Until recently, he was co-host of Hour 25, a Los Angeles area science fiction
radio talk show.

<a href="http://harlanellison.com/"><b>Harlan Ellison</b></a>
is the conceptual consultant for the series.  He has
written a "manifesto" for the show that explains to other writers how to
write science fiction for television and Babylon 5 in particular.  On a
day-to-day basis, he has no preassigned duties (though he plans to write a
script or two) but is something of a generalist, helping refine many aspects
of the production, from writing to sets.  JMS refers to Ellison's position as
"a free-roaming agent of chaos."
