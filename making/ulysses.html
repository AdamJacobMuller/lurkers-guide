<h1>"Ulysses"</h1>
<h2>by Alfred Lord Tennyson</h2>
<p>
It little profits that an idle king,<br>
By this still hearth, among these barren crags,<br>
Match'd with an aged wife, I mete and dole<br>
Unequal laws unto a savage race,<br>
That hoard, and sleep, and feed, and know not me.<br>
I cannot rest from travel; I will drink<br>
Life to the lees.  All times I have enjoy'd<br>
Greatly, have suffer'd greatly, both with those<br>
That loved me, and alone; on shore, and when<br>
Thro' scudding drifts the rainy Hyades<br>
<a name="become.name">
Vext the dim sea.  I am become a name;<br>
</a>
For always roaming with a hungry heart<br>
Much have I seen and known,-- cities of men<br>
And manners, climates, councils, governments,<br>
Myself not least, but honor'd of them all,--<br>
And drunk delight of battle with my peers,<br>
Far on the ringing plains of windy Troy.<br>
I am a part of all that I have met;<br>
Yet all experience is an arch wherethro'<br>
Gleams that untravell'd world whose margin fades<br>
For ever and for ever when I move.<br>
How dull it is to pause, to make an end,<br>
To rust unburnish'd, not to shine in use!<br>
As tho' to breathe were life!  Life piled on life<br>
Were all too little, and of one to me<br>
Little remains; but every hour is saved<br>
From that eternal silence, something more,<br>
A bringer of new things; and vile it were<br>
For some three suns to store and hoard myself,<br>
<a name="spirit">
And this gray spirit yearning in desire<br>
</a>
To follow knowledge like a sinking star,<br>
Beyond the utmost bound of human thought.
<p>
        This is my son, mine own Telemachus,<br>
to whom I leave the sceptre and the isle,--<br>
Well-loved of me, discerning to fulfill<br>
This labor, by slow prudence to make mild<br>
A rugged people, and thro' soft degrees<br>
Subdue them to the useful and the good.<br>
Most blameless is he, centred in the sphere<br>
Of common duties, decent not to fail<br>
In offices of tenderness, and pay<br>
Meet adoration to my household gods,<br>
When I am gone.  He works his work, I mine.
<p>
        There lies the port; the vessel puffs her sail;<br>
There gloom the dark, broad seas.  My mariners,<br>
Souls that have toil'd, and wrought, and thought with me,--<br>
That ever with a frolic welcome took<br>
The thunder and the sunshine, and opposed<br>
Free hearts, free foreheads,-- you and I are old;<br>
Old age hath yet his honor and his toil.<br>
Death closes all; but something ere the end,<br>
Some work of noble note, may yet be done,<br>
Not unbecoming men that strove with Gods.<br>
The lights begin to twinkle from the rocks;<br>
The long day wanes; the slow moon climbs; the deep<br>
Moans round with many voices.  Come, my friends.<br>
'T is not too late to seek a newer world.<br>
Push off, and sitting well in order smite<br>
The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds<br>
To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths<br>
Of all the western stars, until I die.<br>
It may be that the gulfs will wash us down;<br>
It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,<br>
And see the great Achilles, whom we knew.<br>
Tho' much is taken, much abides; and tho'<br>
We are not now that strength which in old days<br>
Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are,--<br>
One equal temper of heroic hearts,<br>
Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will<br>
To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.
