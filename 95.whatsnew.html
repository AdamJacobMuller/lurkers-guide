<dd>
	Much delayed by my lack of time, a
	<a href="synops/048.html">synopsis</a>
	of
	<a href="guide/048.html">"Passing Through Gethsemane"</a>
	is online.

<p>
<dt>December 14, 1995
<dd>
	A
	<a href="/lurk/ftp/Prodigy/951211-bruce">transcript</a>
	of a December 11 Prodigy chat session with Bruce Boxleitner is
	available.

<p>
<dt>December 12, 1995
<dd>
	<a href="/lurk/p5/intro.html">Poll 5</a>
	<a href="/lurk/p5/048">results</a>
	for
	<a href="/lurk/guide/048.html">"Passing Through Gethsemane"</a>
	are available.

<p>
<dt>December 10, 1995
<dd>
	JMS's messages from
	<a href="/lurk/ftp/America-Online/">America Online</a>
	are now being archived (see the file "latest" for the current month's
	messages.)  They are also searchable via the
	<a href="/lurk/search.html">Find</a>
	page.

	<p>
	The
	<a href="/lurk/ftp/History.Babylonia.html">history of Babylonia</a>
	file has been HTMLified.  Thanks to Hallvard B Furuseth.

	<p>
	Switched to the table-based Newsflash section on the home page.
	The vast majority of responses were positive; the only complaints came
	from users of NCSA Mosaic for X, which has had extremely broken table
	support recently.  However, such users can upgrade to the latest beta
	release of Mosaic, which should make the Newsflash section readable.
	Users of non-table-enabled browsers probably won't notice any
	difference.

	<p>
	The
	<a href="credits/041.html">onscreen credits</a>
	for
	<a href="guide/041.html">"Divided Loyalties"</a>
	are online.  Thanks to Dan Dassow.

<p>
<dt>December 7, 1995
<dd>
	The flow of
	<a href="/lurk/ftp/CompuServe/">JMS CompuServe messages</a>
	should be back up to speed now.

<p>
<dt>December 6, 1995
<dd>
	Some episode pages have been shuffled around in the past couple days.
	If you select an episode and get a different episode's page, use
	your browser's reload function and you should get the right page.

	<p>
	I'm considering a slight format change to the Newsflash section on
	the home page.  Have a look at the
	<a href="lurker2.html">alternate version</a>
	and let me know if you object.  I know some people are pretty
	religious about not using tables for formatting, but this <em>is</em>
	tabular information.  In particular I want to know if it breaks
	anyone's browser; I believe I've structured it such that it'll look
	fine on browsers without table support.  (No need to tell me it works
	in Netscape.)  If you're using Mosaic for X, you might want to upgrade
	to the latest beta release, which doesn't break horribly on tables like
	the most recent previous releases have.

	Hyperion's Web server should be much, much faster now; we're getting
	connectivity from
	<a href="http://www.nextron.com/">Interactive Marketing Ventures,</a>
	resulting in significantly higher available bandwidth than we had
	before.  As a result, a lot of the links that used to point to the
	<a href="ftp://ftp.uml.edu/Babylon-5/index.html">ftp.uml.edu</a>
	mirror site are now local instead.  We hope you enjoy the new, faster

   <li> Started retooling the episode guide pages to conform to the Guide's
	new look.  Pages up to
	<a href="guide/015.html">"Grail"</a>
	have been updated so far; more are on their way.
   <li> As part of the retooling, added a "Background" link to the guide
	pages that gives a short summary of the overall storyline up to
	but not including the episode you link from.  The text of the
	summary is mostly taken from the latest version of the FAQ List.
	Useful if you're just starting to watch the show and want to know
	what's gone on before the episode you're about to see.
   <li> A new version of the
	<a href="/lurk/ftp/babylon-5-faq">Babylon 5 FAQ List</a>

<ul>
   <li> Reorganized the

	page slightly, so it's more intuitive (I hope) and more compact.
	Let me know if you think it's significantly better or worse; if
	reaction is positive, I'll apply the same general idea to other
	parts of the Guide to streamline it.
   <li> The guide page for
	<a href="guide/030.html">"A Race Through Dark Places"</a>
	has been fleshed out, thanks to quick action by Dave Zimmerman.
