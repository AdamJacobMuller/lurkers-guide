I
The Shadows have developed a weapon called 'The Cloud'. It is
gray/black and acts as a very large scale energy damper, on the scale of
planets and more it can wipe out almost all energy production. It is 
invisable to (at least the White Star's / Vorlon's) sensors.
Shadows use this to immobilize large fleets, or to calm a planet down before
bombarding it with 'thousands of megatons times thousands of missiles'. These
burrow down, almost into the mantle, before detonating, tearing the planet
apart from the inside.

Missiles: Long, thin and organing looking. Could be hollow too.

II
White Star class ships have automatic repair and other systems, and can
be piloted by a single person if need be, provided that they 'don't run into 
any trouble'.
Extreme cold shuts down the jump engines.
Artifical gravity system offers a form of feed back during combat and 
other near-limit manouvers to indicate it is near it's design limits. 
This manifests as an appropriate centrifugal 'force'.
There is some evidence that some of the fleet may have replaced their 
forward neutron cannon with a non-line of sight 'slice-n-dice' type 
ray. This may have been learnt during encounters with the Shadows, due 
to the Vorlon and hence evolving nature of the ship.

Handguns: Silver, long barreled and elabortly designed.

III
Old style destroyers: Similar to Hyperion class. No rotating sections
however. Has four forward and four backward pointing guns mounted in
pairts on the top and bottom of the main body. These guns are very
large, assumed heavy energy.

PPG rifles: Long, ovel barrel, with a red laser sight mounted on top.

Link: The molecular bonding system used to attach it to skin appears 
to fail under some conditions, pulling the hairs out of the wearers 
arm.

Molecular Container: A substance harder than diamond, designed to be 
hardened around the object to be transported. The containment can only 
be broken using the appropiete molecule.

Ienticards can be cloned, but this is a samll time operation as it is 
usualy easy to detect, and brings on a small fine as punishment.

IV
Vree look like shrimps in armor.
Vree ships are shaped like discs, like the classic UFO shape. From their
underside they fire many green dart shaped blasts, very rapidly. These are
very effective against fighters.
Vree ships: c. 400 m in diameter

TRANSLATOR: Connected to the envirmoment suit, looks vaguly like a 
crystal ball held in a metal skelaton. Flashes when in use.

V
Also highly resilient to even large gun fire power, 3 Battle Crab death
beams needed to disable one within a reasonable time frame.

VI
Vorlon's are able to wrap areas of hyperspace in on itself, effectively hiding
their ships from passing ships. However, there is no physical method to stop
other ships entering the bubble. They appear to use this to sneak up on
targets. On passing through this bubble, a mottle blue web-work 
appears on the skin of the ship. Instruments appear to be confused by 
the curvature of hyperspace inside the bubble, making navigation 
difficult.

Encounter Suits: Vorlon encounter suits can energize blue energy at the back
of the up-sweeping ridge, and uses this as controlled lightning. Suits
can also absorb, to a point, massive amounts of energy, whether electrical
or as plasma (as in a PPG shot). Able to surround itself with a 
transperent dome able to reflect weapons fired at it.
Vorlons true form is a large semi-transparent almost-fluid like being,
but can project different images into each of those present.
Vorlon bio-technology is advanced enough to modify humans with gills, and
increased telepathic abilities.


VORLON PLANET KILLERS (formally Big Ships):
Huge, massive, gigantic- *BIG* etc. etc.
Saucer shaped with blue edge and four massive reaching tendrils at the
front. '3 or 4 miles across'.
CAPABILITIES: Unknown. Hyperspace engines for certain, probably able to
open a jump point, as it is probably responsible for the hyperspace 'folding'.
Its fire power is the key feature of a Vorlon planet destroying raid. They
emerge from hyperspace with just enough firepower to cover the planet killer,
wipe out the target, and vanish.
The firing sequence starts with the blue edge turning yellow in a sweeping
band from the left and right. The bands meet in the middle, and project
something forward, where it is guided and controlled by the tendrils before
being fired.

Ships appear to be either red/orange or green in colour.

HEAVY CRUISERS: Larger version of cruisers, but with a single necelle shaped
tear-drop protrusion on the top at the back. This appears to have many small
yellow windows in it.
CAPABILITIES: Jump point generator, hyperspace engines. More powerful version
of a cruiser. Close in weapons ?

OBSERVATION POST: In at least one case the Vorlons built a city on a large
asteroid, and used it as an observation post. It had many close in and long
range weapon systems to offer protection. The city was comprised of spires and
saucers.

TRANSLATOR: Worn on encounter suit, although Vorlons are telepathic 
and have no need of them ! POints of light flash on and off when used.

VII
The Babylon 5 universe operates on the (outdated ?) theory of 'Particular
Time', that is there are particles ( called chronos ) that 'carry' time.
This means it is possible to prevent chronos progress, trapping things in the 
'gap' between two instances, between the tick and the tock.

VIII
First One's ships are generally extremely big. They generally use non-standard
jump points.
The ships are extremely powerful. Three ones of various races were able
to destroy a Vorlon Planet Killer in just a few seconds. Weapons fired are as
varied as the races. There are Vorlon-like nexus-generated beams, which fire
out at varying angles from the nexus, huge long pilers of energy, yellow
electric like rays and many more.

Sigma 957's: Fires from the base of the hemi-sphere, many bolts of 
thin lightning.

VIV
Narn Handguns: Rectangular, with three short barels one above each 
other. Fires orange/red shots.

X
Centuri Handguns: Shapped like long-bareled versions of Earth pistols, 
ornately decorated. Fires blue shots.
Centuri Rifles: Long, with a blast shield to protect the firer, fire s
white spheres.

XI
The Draak are dark servants of the Shadows, distintive by their weird 
smeared out look.
MOTHERSHIP: Several tens of times longer than a White Star, the 
armour is very strong, the combined efforts of several White Stars not 
even scratching it !
CAPABILITIES: Not yet known

FIGHTER: A less organic looking Vorlon fighter, with a blue/green 
crystel held in the grip of four tendrils. This emmits a continuos 
green/blue ray, along which pulses travel. This must be powerful, 
because it managed to damage a White Star, although not seriously.
CAPABILITIES: Powerful beam weapon.

TRAVEL POD: Shaped like a tulip bulb, it opens two sets of four petals 
(inner and outer) while traverling, similar to a Vorlon ship.
CAPABILITIES: Not yet known

TRANSLATOR: A small tennis ball sized sphere that pulses.

XII
Not all real space co-ords are able to exit to hyper space. When a point is 
formed it settles itself at an appropiete real space co-ord (see Jump 
Gates) and links into hyper space. This means hyper space is a limited 
sub-set of all of the points in real space, so of course distances in 
hyper space are shorter, and now we don't need to worry about the 
1:many, many: 1 real space : hyper space thing and its attached 
probablistic problems.


XIII
The planetary slicer beam(s) on Epsilon 3 bear a similar look to the Shadows
beam weapon. Epsilion 3 also has a weather control system.
15 km/s seems to be a standard attack speed, for Humans and Minbari anyway.
