0:00-3:17

Track 2: Messages From Earth
0:00-1:38: "Z'ha'dum" -- The fall of the White Star and the Z'ha'BOOM.
1:39-2:09: "Voices of Authority" -- Shadows attack Ivanova in the machine.
2:10-4:20: "Severed Dreams" -- Earthforce ships arrive.  Battle.  Attempted

            suicide run.
5:17-6:39:  "Severed Dreams" --  repeat Hiroshi's suicide run through
            destruction of other Earthforce cruiser.

6:30-10:05: Reorchestration of themes from 4:48-5:38.  Probably original
            to this album and not from any actual episode.  Note that from
            9:00-9:12 we hear Christopher Franke's "signature sound" that
            he includes somewhere in all of his solo albums.

Track 3: Main Title 2nd Season 
0:00-1:30

Track 4: Z'ha'dum
0:00-0:50: From 0:29-0:50 is played in "Messages From Earth", as G'Kar writes
           in his book.
0:51-1:59: "The Long Twilight Struggle" -- Narns and Shadows arrive at
           Gorash VII; battle begins.

           the Narn homeworld.
2:56-3:40: "Comes The Inquisitor" -- Lennier asks Sheridan to defy Kosh
             and intervene to save Delenn; Delenn gets zapped.

           about the Draffa plague; Delenn visits Sheridan prior to entering

Track 5: Main Title 3rd Season 
0:00-1:31

Track 6: Severed Dreams
0:00-1:06:
1:07-1:58:
1:59-2:35:
2:36-4:01: "Messages from Earth" -- Marcus battles to save Dr. Kirkish.  This
           runs longer than the music in the episode; the last thirty seconds
           or so repeats the beginning.
4:02-6:29: "Messages from Earth" -- Dr. Kirkish tells her story.
6:30-9:45: "Messages from Earth" -- The White Star arrives at Ganymede;

             via atmospheric jump point.
14:10-14:30: *Not* "Messages From Earth".  That episode does have a triumphant
             fanfare at this point, but it's a different one.  By 14:30 we're
             definitely back into the score of "MfE".
14:30-14:52: "Messages from Earth": Sheridan congratulates the White Star's
             crew; the White Star begins its return journey through hyperspace.
14:53-15:37: "Messages from Earth": Nightwatch theme.
