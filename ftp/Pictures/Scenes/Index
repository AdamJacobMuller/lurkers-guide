INDEX OF BABYLON 5 PICTURES - Scenes directory

This directory contains scenes from the series, primarily indoor shots that
aren't appropriate for the Effects directory.  Images of characters who only
appear in one episode can also mostly be found here.

The file Index940707.jpg is a grid with shrunken versions of most of the
pictures here.  If you like, use it to determine which pictures interest
you.  Thumbnail images of most of these pictures can be found in the "Thumb" 
directory.

Some pictures are available in both GIF and JPEG formats; only the JPEG
versions are listed here, as that's the preferred type.

Pictures copyright 1992-94 Synthetic Worlds Ltd, PTEN, and Warner Brothers
Domestic Television Distribution.
