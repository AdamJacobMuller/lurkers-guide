<h1>Babylon 5 Pictures</h1>
<p>
This area contains various images from and about Babylon 5.  The images
are divided into four categories:
<dl>
<dt>
<a href="Characters/">Characters</a>
<dd>
	Pictures of the people and aliens of Babylon 5.
<dt>
<a href="Effects/">Effects</a>
<dd>
	Outer-space scenes and other effects shots.
<dt>
<a href="Misc/">Misc</a>
<dd>
	Miscellaneous pictures (e.g. advertisements.)
<dt>
<a href="Scenes/">Scenes</a>
<dd>
	Scenes from specific episodes.
</dl>
<p>
Each of the categories contains its own index file as well as a pictorial
index with miniature versions of all the pictures.  If you're just browsing,
consider downloading the index files first so you don't waste time with
pictures you're not interested in.
<p>
On the other hand, if you want to waste a lot of time, there is an
<a href="thumbs.html">alternate interface</a>
to this directory with inline miniatures of the images.  Getting the
index file is usually faster, since it's in JPEG format and is fairly
compact.
