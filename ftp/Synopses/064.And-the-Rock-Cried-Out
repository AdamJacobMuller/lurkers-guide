  Synopsis by Katrina Glerum (kat@midwinter.com)
  
   Z Minus 14 Days
   
   The station is a flurry of activity as war preparations continue.
   Since they can jam the Shadows, telepaths of many races are being
   recruited and assigned to Army of Light patrol ships. G'Kar insists
   that each telepath should be given a Narn bodyguard.
   
   Londo thinks G'Kar has been permitted to escape Centauri wrath for too
   long, however. Vir is appalled that Londo could care about petty
   revenge when the entire galaxy is suffused with war.
   
   [INLINE] Appreciating Brother Theo for the stability his monks have
   offered in the chaos, Ivanova joins him in Docking to greet some
   religious "colleagues." Personal and professional rivalry aside,
   Brother Theo seems genuinely pleased to meet the Baptist minister,
   rabbi, Buddhist monk and Islamic cleric who have arrived.
   
   Looking weary and haggard, Captain Sheridan is lost so deep in
   contemplation that he is oblivious to Delenn's teasing. Nothing about
   the Shadows' strategy makes any sense. The timing and location of the
   attacks seem random and illogical, but the individual engagements are
   tactically very logical. The Captain isn't eating properly, hasn't
   slept well since Kosh's death, and is suffering from nightmares. So
   Delenn bullies him into meeting the new arrivals for dinner that
   night.
   
   Another arrival has the Centauri flustered - or at least Vir. Nothing
   seems to faze Londo any more, not even Lord Refa and Minister Virini.
   Londo outlines his plan to ensnare G'Kar by having Vir pass on the
   tale that G'Kar's former assistant Na'Toth is imprisoned on the Narn
   homeworld. G'Kar will then rush back to Narn to rescue her and be
   taken captive by Londo's agents. Vir refuses until Londo threatens to
   humiliate and destroy Vir's family in retribution.
   
   As smarmy as ever, Lord Refa presents his case to the Minister of why
   his house should achieve ascendancy over that of Mollari. The
   ambassador has spent too much time among aliens, he claims, and is no
   longer loyal. The Minister wants the rivalry between the two houses
   ended and is apparently on the station to determine which of the two
   deserve his support.
   
   Cringing pathetically, Vir takes his mission to G'Kar, while Londo
   informs the Minister that the division between the two houses will be
   ended soon through his relieving the Empire of an ongoing
   embarrassment. Vir can't contain his anger when he realizes that Londo
   intends to kill G'Kar in order to curry royal favor. His outrage does
   not go unnoticed by Refa's spies. Vir is captured and interrogated by
   Lord Refa himself. When he tries to hold out, a telepath easily rips
   Londo's plan from his mind.
   
   At dinner it is revealed that the religious leaders are part of an
   organized resistance and intelligence gathering movement on Earth, and
   come bearing information for B5. Before leaving, Reverend Dexter says
   that he wants to hold a religious gathering on the station. The
   Captain agrees over Brother Theo's humorous objections.
   
   Reverend Dexter finds Sheridan still working late in his office, and
   asks him who he shares his heavy responsibility with. Sheridan grows
   irritated with the minister's presumption, especially with the
   implication that Sheridan is not being a good officer and the
   suggestion that he should share his burden with the woman who loves
   him.
   
   Z Minus 13 Days
   
   Peering into the cold, wind-wracked desolation of the former Narn
   capital, G'Kar gathers his forces for a mission into the secret
   caverns below the city. The ruins above are being rebuilt and
   redecorated to look like the Centauri Imperial Palace. Refa has just
   arrived and requests a security detail from Lord Drego to assist him
   in capturing G'Kar.
   
   [INLINE] Musing in the war room, Delenn and Sheridan realize that the
   Shadows are corralling refugees into zones where they can be
   annihilated with ease. This war is "as much about terror as
   territory," he argues. A strike against defenseless refugees would
   have a great demoralizing effect on the Alliance. "It's what I'd do,"
   he crows.
   
   "What?" Delenn gasps.
   
   When he tries to explain that they need to think like the enemy, she
   grabs him by the arm and drags him out of the war room telling him he
   seriously needs a break.
   
   G'Kar and his Narns proceed underground. Refa and his guards pick up
   the trail and follow him into an ambush. Refa gloats, "You have taken
   your last steps as a free Narn!"
   
   Back on the station, Reverend Dexter begins his sermon. The enemy is
   not just something different. "We are all alien to one another," he
   argues. "The enemy is fear. The enemy is ignorance. The enemy is the
   one who tells you that we must hate that which is different."
   
   [INLINE] As the service continues, a far eerier ritual begins deep
   under the surface of Narn. Refa orders his guards to attack G'Kar. His
   face shows the first signs of fear when they fail to move. Then G'Kar
   brings out a holo projector with a recording of Londo telling his
   nemesis his fate. In return for Mollari freeing 2000 incarcerated
   Narns, G'Kar has captured Refa, the Centauri who is personally
   responsible for the planetary bombardment of Narn and the deaths of 5
   or 6 million Narns.
   
   Holding aloft a data crystal, G'Kar admonishes his Narns only to leave
   this on the body and keep the face and head intact for identification
   later.
   
   "No hiding place!" the gospel singer begins in the B5 chapel. As the
   congregation joins in joyously, Refa scrambles down a corridor into
   the arms of waiting Narns. "There's no hiding place down here!." He
   runs terrified back the way he came. "You know the sinner's gonna be
   runnin' at the knowledge of their fate!" Refa barrels into a crowd of
   eager Narns. "They'll be runnin' trying to find a hiding place when it
   comes their time to die!" Even the Minbari begin to catch the spirit
   and try to sing along. "No hiding place!" Refa's crest drowns under a
   sea of spotted heads, and he is brutally attacked by the Narn as G'Kar
   watches, then leaves.
   
   Mollari gives the data crystal found on Lord Refa's body to Minister
   Virini, and explains how Refa had betrayed the Centauri to the Narn
   and G'Kar to the Centauri. The minister seems surprised that Londo
   asks for nothing in return for exposing this plot. Vir is furious
   again however, this time for being set up and lied to. Londo says he
   knew that Refa had a telepath with him, so of course he had to tell
   Vir what he wanted Refa to believe. But Vir is not placated.
   
   [INLINE] Delenn has a final surprise for the Captain. In the long
   period of preparation before the war, the Minbari have completed an
   entire fleet of White Star class ships.
