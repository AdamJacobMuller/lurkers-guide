  Synopsis by Katrina Glerum (kat@midwinter.com)
  
   Once again the station mobilizes for war. The murder of 10,000
   refugees fleeing Proxima 3 has forced Sheridan to decide that it's
   time to retaliate against Clark.
   
   Sheridan calls a full Council meeting first thing in the morning. In
   return for the safety his White Star patrols have brought to uneasy
   borders, he declares all League World military treaties with Earth
   null and void. As Starfuries run drills outside, Ivanova requests that
   each government contribute a military vessel to the defense of the
   station. Other than that, they must take no part in the war.
   
   "We're going to take back our home. Or die trying," Captain Sheridan
   concludes.
   
   Marcus races through the station to the War Room with a data crystal
   that holds intelligence detailing the Earth Force blockade of Proxima
   3. Of six destroyers, two were responsible for shooting down the
   transport.
   
   Meanwhile, even though Franklin admits little progress on freeing the
   Shadow-implanted telepaths, Sheridan demands that he get them mobile
   as quickly as possible for an imminent mission.
   
   To Ivanova he explains his plan for attacking Proxima 3. By offering
   the combatants a chance to surrender or defect, he will attempt to
   minimize the Earth Force losses; nevertheless he will destroy any ship
   that fights back.
   
   Vir is roused from a nightmare by Garibaldi at the door. When
   Garibaldi asks for Londo, Vir lets it slip out that the Ambassador has
   gone to speak with G'Kar, then divulges the plan to attack Earth. Vir
   is surprised that Garibaldi is disgusted with Sheridan's move. Even
   though he doesn't always agree with Londo, Vir says he continues to
   follow, because sometimes Londo's right.
   
   Close quarters maneuvers continue outside under Lt. Corwin's
   supervision. Ivanova orders the fighters to only accept commands that
   are encrypted with the code of the day. Corwin remarks that they
   should trust no one.
   
   "No," Ivanova remarks acerbically. "Trust Ivanova. Trust yourself.
   Anybody else? Shoot 'em."
   
   The destroyer Starfuries patrolling hyperspace near the Proxima 3 jump
   gate are oblivious to the fleet of White Stars gathering in the murky
   redness there. Marcus learns that the resistance on the planet's
   surface is being demolished by Clark's ground forces.
   
   G'Kar's writing is interrupted by Mollari's entrance. They take a
   couple of shots across each other 's bows until Mollari admits that he
   didn't come to fight but to talk. The past years have been very hard
   on both of them. G'Kar snorts in derision, but Mollari continues
   humbly, thanking G'Kar for his actions and endurance that set both of
   their worlds free, telling G'Kar that he has come to respect him
   deeply.
   
   G'Kar scorns both the thanks and the respect.
   
   Mollari forges ahead angrily. He is a patriot, he shouts, and yet,
   through ill judgment he himself became his own enemy. So can he
   possibly "understand who the enemy is?" Perhaps not. But he can
   understand friendship, and the humans of Babylon 5 have been friends.
   Thus he has convinced his government to put their full support behind
   Sheridan, and requests that G'Kar do the same. Pouring out two drinks,
   he proposes a toast "to the humans, and to the bridge that they
   created between us, in the hope for a better future, for both our
   worlds."
   
   As Mollari waits with glass raised, G'Kar pours his drink back in the
   bottle. With heavy disappointment, Mollari departs.
   
   Sheridan and Ivanova have the difficult task of prepping the Starfury
   crews for battle. They are told to defend themselves with deadly fire
   and come home alive, yet show mercy to any non-combatant.
   
   Sheridan departs for the front leaving Ivanova to command the station.
   His flagship White Star 2 sports newly painted Army of Light logos on
   the wings.
   
   The commander of the fleet blockading Proxima 3 orders two destroyers
   to attack the White Stars that jump out of hyperspace on the opposite
   side of the planet. When he recognizes the ships as Sheridan's he
   orders his destroyers to attack. Macdougan, the captain of the Vesta,
   engages John in a conversation about the legality of Clark's orders.
   When Macdougan refuses to enter the fray, fleet commander Hall grants
   a field promotion to Macdougan's second, a rank he enjoys for about 60
   seconds until the Vesta's crew ends it.
   
   The Pollux is destroyed, two vessels stand down, and another
   withdraws. Fearing a tribunal more than death, Captain Hall orders his
   crew to continue the fight until his own second relieves him of
   command and surrenders.
   
   Sheridan calls the captains of the surviving destroyers together and
   offers them the choice of going home or joining up. When they object
   to his methods he argues that they swore to protect Earth, that they
   work for all humans, not for Clark in particular. In the final
   analysis one ship withdraws, one joins the defense of Proxima 3, and
   two join Sheridan.
   
   As he drinks alone again in morose contemplation, Londo notices a shot
   raised to the lips of another nearby. Sternly G'Kar orders Londo to
   issue the joint statement of their worlds' support of Sheridan. He
   refuses to sign it on the same page though. G'Kar departs just as
   rapidly leaving the Ambassador choked with emotion.
   
   As the Voice of Resistance announces the victory and encourages other
   Earth Force vessels to defect, Garibaldi leaves the station for Mars
   vowing never to return.
