  Synopsis by Matthew Murray (mmurray@wsu.edu)
  
   On C&C, Ivanova tells Sheridan about a Markab cruiser that is ten
   hours overdue that has resisted all attempts at communication. She
   says she wants to send out Zeta squadron to find out what happened to
   the ship, and that she will do so as soon as Lieutenant Keffer
   returns, searching for what he once saw in hyperspace. Sheridan tells
   Ivanova to order Keffer back to the station and curb further
   expeditions.
   
   Lazarenn, a Markab doctor, examines a dead Markab with Dr. Franklin.
   The death seems rather mysterious, and Lazarenn tells Franklin he
   would prefer to keep jurisdiction over his own species. But, since
   this Markab is the fourth dead Markab in three days dead of natural
   causes, Franklin is suspicious. He tells Lazarenn that he will
   continue to run further tests.
   
   Ivanova explains to Zeta squadron that their mission is to find the
   Markab ship and determine the problem, if there is one. As she sends
   them out, she tells Keffer that Captain Sheridan has ordered him to
   curb his expeditions into hyperspace. Though he initially protests,
   after he is threatened with a four-month suspension of flight
   priveleges, he changes his mind, and leaves to join the squadron.
   
   Sheridan sits down for dinner with Delenn and Lennier. Lennier has
   spent two days engrossed in an exhaustive cooking ritual, preparing
   food for Sheridan's dinner, so that he may better understand the
   Minbari. Sheridan is anxious to begin eating, but is informed that he
   must also follow certain rituals in the eating of the dinner. Delenn
   explains that, if they are not followed, Lennier will have to begin
   again. Delenn and Sheridan exchange bowls, give part of their meal to
   Lennier in thanks, and Sheridan places one piece of food in the place
   set aside for Valen's return. Sheridan is then able to take one bite
   before he must meditate.
   
   Zeta squadron arrives at the Markab vessel, and attempts to open
   communication, to no avail. Keffer scans the vessel, but discovers no
   life signs, though there are over two hundred life forms on the
   vessel. All the Markab on the ship are dead. Meanwhile, Dr. Franklin,
   while examining the Markab on the station, asks to have access to the
   other dead Markab before they are sent back to their homeworld.
   
   Zeta squadron returns to the station with the Markab ship in tow.
   Franklin tells Ivanova that they need a full medical team to
   investigate it, and that he thinks Sheridan should be there as well.
   Sheridan, who fell asleep while observing the Minbari rituals of
   eating, is awakened by Ivanova telling him to go to the docking bay
   where the Markab ship has been brought. Sheridan apologizes, though
   Delenn tells him that the meal was completed before he fell asleep.
   
   Sheridan arrives in the docking bay to find Dr. Lazarenn there, not
   wanting Sheridan or any other non-Markab inside. Dr. Franklin explains
   that they aren't wanted aboard the ship because all four dead Markab
   died from an infectious disease. Dr. Franklin demands to know how
   terminal and contagious the disease is. "It is one hundred percent
   terminal," Lazarenn imparts. "And one hundred percent contagious."
   
   The plague continues to spread among the Markab population as Dr.
   Franklin confronts Lazarenn and demands to know why he wanted to keep
   the plague a secret. Lazarenn explains that the plague is not
   something normally talked about -- it is considered a disease that
   only occurs to an immoral people, because the first documented case
   struck an immoral population isolated on the Markab homeworld, killing
   the entire populace. They assumed that the plague had been wiped out,
   and therefore was no longer a threat. Lazarenn explains that Drafa,
   the disease, had been used to frighten children into behaving, and was
   still believed to only inflict the immoral. Though the first new case
   had been discovered nearly a year ago, the Markab were still scared to
   admit that the problem had resurfaced, and since none of them wanted
   to be considered immoral, it was kept secret, which made the disease
   spread even faster. In an attempt to escape the disease, the Markab
   have fled to every Markab colony, including Babylon 5, spreading the
   plague throughout the Markab populace. Dr. Franklin doesn't understand
   why he wasn't consulted, but Lazarenn tells him that he was forbidden
   by his government, which refuses to assist in any way. Franklin's last
   question is whether or not the disease is infectious beyond the Markab
   species, but Lazarenn has no way of knowing.
   
   A young Markab girl wanders through the corridors of Babylon 5,
   looking for something. She soon locates what she is looking for, her
   father, who is sitting against a wall. She touches him, and he falls
   over. She cries out and turns around, into the arms of Delenn.
   
   Dr. Franklin talks to the command staff and his medical officers. The
   disease is invisible while in its incubation period of up to several
   weeks, but after it shows up, the patients live for about a day.
   Garibaldi asks how far it has spread, and Franklin explains that they
   have to assume the entire Markab population has been exposed. Sheridan
   asks if the plague is limited to the Markab, but Franklin doesn't
   know, and says that's what they need to find out. If the disease is
   airborne, the recycled air aboard the station could put everyone at
   risk. Sheridan asks Franklin what to do, and Franklin wants every
   Markab brought in for testing so they can discover how the disease
   works. The disease, he explains, takes over the central nervous
   system, keeping it from working properly. Sheridan orders Ivanova to
   put the station under quarantine, keeping all ships in the station,
   and preventing other ones from coming in. One of the medical officers
   suggests segregating the Markab away from everyone else, but Franklin
   says that will only cause the disease to spread among the Markab
   faster and that, if the disease is airborne, it won't make any
   difference. Garibaldi says that, if all the Markab are in one place,
   he can watch over them better when turmoil strikes the station.
   
   Turmoil does strike the station, causing a panic when no one is able
   to leave the quarantined station. The Markab are continuously tested
   for the plague, as more continue to get sick and die. The Markab
   ambassador is outraged by the way the Markab are being treated,
   blaming Sheridan for spreading fear among his people. He tries to
   explain that his people are moral, and believes that Sheridan might be
   part of a conspiracy against the Markab, or that even the immorality
   of the humans had infected them. The Markab ambassador begins to
   leave, and tells Sheridan that he and the rest of the Markab are going
   into isolation to protect themselves from the immorality of others.
   Dr. Franklin calls Sheridan and tells him that the disease is indeed
   airborne, and that his people have found a dead Pak'ma'ra with no
   visible signs of death. He believes the disease may be spreading into
   the general population.
   
   The Markab ambassador herds his people into their isolation area,
   reassuring them that they are pure and that they will be spared the
   plague if they are good. The other races aboard the station are all
   too happy to see them go.
   
   Dr. Franklin orders an autopsy performed on a dead Markab before it is
   too late, but none of the other medical officers want to risk
   exposure. Franklin offers to go in, but is interrupted by Lazarenn,
   who offers to go in instead, since he knows much more about the
   plague. Since the isolation booth is sealed, no one else will be in
   danger should he contract the disease. Lazarenn enters the booth and
   appraoches the dead Markab to begin the autopsy.
   
   Sheridan receives a call from Ivanova who tells him that the violence
   against the Markab is increasing aboard Babylon 5. 4,000 of the
   station's 5,000 Markab have entered the isolation zone, but the rest
   may be in considerable danger if found by other races. Sheridan wants
   the violence stopped as quickly as possible. Ivanova suggests he get
   some sleep. Sheridan agrees, but as he is about to rest, Delenn enters
   and tells Sheridan that she wants to be allowed into the isolation
   zone to help the Markab. Delenn says that she has been taught to help
   others when they are in need, and though Sheridan tries to convince
   her otherwise, he is unable to dissuade her. She says that she
   understands the risk, and that she and Lennier should do all they can
   to help the Markab, since they may all be in need of similar help very
   soon. She knows that she may have to remain in there if she contracts
   the disease, but she is willing to make the sacrifice. Sheridan
   relents and decides to let her enter the zone. "All life is
   transitory," she tells him. "A dream. We all come together in the same
   place at the end of time. If I don't see you again here, I will see
   you in a little while, in the place where no shadows fall." She starts
   to leave, but Sheridan stops her.
   
   "Delenn...? When I do see you again, call me John?" She smiles, nods,
   and leaves.
   
   A few humans attack a Markab, and kick him in the stomach while he is
   down on the ground. Garibaldi arrives and stops the torture, but the
   Markab is near death. He reaches a bloody hand out to Garibaldi.
   Hesitating only fractionally, Garibaldi takes the Markab's hand.
   
   Delenn and Lennier approach the gate to the isolation zone and are
   admitted by the EarthForce officer attending it. They enter quickly,
   and are immediately assaulted by the great pain and death they see all
   around them, though they are able to keep a somewhat pleasant
   attitude, knowing that they may be able to help.
   
   Dr. Franklin injects himself with stims in order to keep himself
   awake. Lazarenn, still inside the isolation area, tries to convince
   Dr. Franklin to sleep, but Franklin says that, if the plague has
   spread, that won't matter much. They haven't found out anymore about
   the Pak'ma'ra, but more and more Markab continue to die, though the
   violence has been brought under control. Franklin explains that he
   doesn't understand why humans never learn from all the diseases they
   face, such as the Black Death, AIDS, and Chalmer's Syndrome. Lazarenn
   asks about the Black Death, and Dr. Franklin explains how it hit
   Europe in the 14th century, and that it too was considered an immoral
   disease, possibly sent by the devil. Cats, the familiars of the
   devils, were killed by the millions, but since they were the only way
   to control the rat population, the true way the disease was spread,
   the plague spread even faster. Lazarenn finds the situation humorous,
   since often the strategy that makes the least sense is the one that's
   done the most. He then collapses against the window of the isolation
   booth, and explains that his suspicions are confirmed: he has
   contracted the plague. He tells Franklin to run tests as quickly as
   possible, now that he has someone in the earliest stages of infection.
   
   Delenn and Lennier minister to the Markab in the isolation zone,
   trying to make them more comfortable, though it doesn't seem as if
   they are doing much good. Delenn sees the young Markab girl she met
   earlier, who is now unable to find her mother. Delenn calls to
   Lennier, telling him to find her mother. When Lennier asks how he
   should find her, Delenn responds, "Faith manages." Delenn asks the
   girl her mother's name, and the girl tells her that her name is Mama.
   "Faith manages," repeats Lennier as he begins the search.
   
   Dr. Franklin examines some of the data from the tests, and continues
   to run more tests, though they only have a very short period of time.
   Lazarenn explains how he feels, and Franklin orders still more tests.
   While he is suffering, Lazarenn thinks back to how he and Franklin
   first met many years ago. It was when Franklin was on layover on the
   Markab homeworld, and Franklin was hitchhiking on starships. Franklin
   looked upon everything as a test in those days. "Sometimes the test is
   not to find the answer, it is to see how you react when you realize
   there is no answer." A medical officer comes up with the results of
   the Pak'ma'ra autopsy -- the plague is now affecting the Pak'ma'ra as
   well. Franklin, exasperated and irritable, orders some officers to
   find out what happened to the Pak'ma'ra, before time runs out.
   
   The young Markab girl is still worried about her mother, and asks
   Delenn if she has been found yet. Delenn says no, but says she knows
   what the young girl is going through. She once became seperated from
   her parents on a visit to the city, and she became more and more lost
   until she found herself in an old temple, where she decided to wait
   until her parents arrived. Though her parents didn't come for hours,
   she felt safe there, and fell asleep. A tall figure told the young
   Delenn that she would be fine as long as she believed her parents
   would come. The figure told her that he would not allow harm to come
   to her. At that moment, Delenn's parents arrived in the temple. As she
   completes the story, Lennier too arrives with the young girl's mother.
   The young girl runs to her mother and hugs her, and soon turns around
   to thank Delenn, but is barely able to keep her balance. The smile
   vanishes from Delenn's face as she realizes what is happening.
   
   Dr. Franklin continues tests on the Pak'ma'ra, but continues to find
   nothing. He tries to cross-reference Markab yellow cells with
   Pak'ma'ra green cells. Lazarenn speaks up, but is unable to say much
   beyond, "The yellow cells could be..." He attempts to say more, but
   fails, and dies while speaking to Franklin. Franklin, in his rage,
   overturns a cart of medical equipment, but his anger evaporates when
   the computer reports that a match has been found.
   
   Franklin explains to Sheridan that the plague works by neutralizing
   the chemicals in the synaptic gaps of a body, which prevent the
   chemicals from relating messages from the brain between neurons. A few
   races use specialized cells to manufacture chemicals used in neural
   relays, but since humans don't work that way, they aren't in danger.
   Franklin says the disease can't be destroyed, but he can stimulate
   production of yellow and green cells so that they will eventually be
   able to fight off the disease. He's prepared enough for five hundred
   doses of the cure, but hasn't had time to test it, and there is nearly
   no time left.
   
   Franklin, Sheridan, and Ivanova go to the isolation zone and enter,
   and are greeted by a grisly sight. There is nearly complete silence as
   they look around the isolation zone and see that every Markab has
   died. Delenn and Lennier appear. Franklin asks if anyone is left
   alive, and Lennier tells him that they are all dead.
   
   Lennier departs, but Delenn, overcome by the situation, falls crying
   against Sheridan's shoulder.
   
   Delenn tells Sheridan that he should be congratulated for finding a
   way to stop the plague. Sheridan tries to explain that it is because
   of Franklin that they were able to prevent further infection. Sheridan
   asks what happens next time, and Delenn says that, if they honor the
   memory of those who died, and remember what happened, the other races
   will grow, and further problems of this sort will not occur.
   
   "Medical ships dispatched to the Markab homeworld have confirmed the
   death toll," an ISN reporter says. "The entire planetary population
   has been wiped out by the plague. Over two billion dead, in addition
   to another two or three million on other colonies and outposts.
   Although it is expected that some Markabs may have survived on
   isolated colonies, for all intents and purposes, the Markab
   civilization has been destroyed." Franklin, sitting at a bar beneath a
   video screen, listens painfully to the news report as other patrons of
   the bar joke about the deaths of the Markab and spread rumors about
   the dead Markab. The bartender shuts off the television set, refusing
   to listen anymore.
   
   "Nothing changes," Franklin says to himself. He gets up from the bar
   and walks away.
