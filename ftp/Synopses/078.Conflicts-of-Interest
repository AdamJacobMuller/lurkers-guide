  Synopsis by Matthew Murray (mmurray@cc.wwu.edu)
  
   Garibaldi is in his "office" in helping a man reunite with his lost
   wife/daughter--an act observed by Wade. He leaves and goes out into
   the hallway, where he meets with another man. Wade tells the man that
   it's about time Garibaldi got his first assignment, which will be a
   chance to see how sincere he really is in helping them. Wade wants to
   know how he handles himself in a crunch, and if he gets himself
   killed, they will know they have the wrong guy. "At this point," Wade
   tells the other gentleman, "Mr. Garibaldi is eminently expendable."
   
   Zack enters Sheridan's office to find the Captain staring, silently,
   at a painting hanging on his wall. Sheridan explains that he has been
   doing some thinking, and that there are some unpleasant things he
   needs to take care of, which he can do now that Delenn is gone. He
   tells Zack that, when Garibaldi resigned as Chief of Security, he
   didn't turn in his link, identicard, or PPG. Zack tells Sheridan that
   he doesn't think Garibaldi would take it very well, and that it
   doesn't make sense that Garibaldi is acting the way he is. Sheridan
   says that he wants this taken care of that same day. Zack agrees, but
   wants to know why Sheridan is in such a hurry. "I don't like the
   company he's been keeping," the Captain replies. Zack leaves.
   
   Dr. Franklin enters the war room, which is being reconfigured as a
   broadcast newsroom. He sees Ivanova, who is helping to set things up
   for the first broadcast. Franklin tells her that his business on Mars
   is concluded, and the rest of the resistance is on the station. He
   asks how she is doing, and she says that everything is ready to go,
   except that they don't have enough power to send the broadcast
   everywhere it needs to go. She says that she has been trying to find a
   solution for days, but hasn't had any success. Franklin suggests she
   try Epsilon III--there must be a source of power down there, since
   they were able to evacuate refugees there during the Shadow War with
   no trouble. Ivanova tells Franklin it's the logical choice, and that
   "anybody could see that in about two seconds." Franklin tells her
   that, of course, he never would have thought of it, and that it is a
   great idea. Without discussing the matter further, Ivanova leaves to
   catch a shuttle to Epsilon III.
   
   Zack arrives at Garibaldi's office, and asks him how he is. Garibaldi
   says that he's doing fine, and that he likes working in this kind of
   an environment--you get to see and know the people you help. Garibaldi
   asks Zack how he is, but his response is less than enthusiastic. Zack
   reluctantly tells Garibaldi that he needs his link, indenticard, and
   his weapon. Garibaldi doesn't mind getting rid of the indenticard and
   the link, but doesn't want to get rid of the gun. Zack presses him and
   Garibaldi does give us weapon and starts to walk away, but Zack asks
   him for the backup he knows he carries as well, which Garibaldi
   unwillingly surrenders. Zack asks Garibaldi what he should have done,
   and Garibaldi says he should have said no--that way, it wouldn't have
   had to come from Zack. Without saying another word, Garibaldi turns
   and walks away.
   
   As Ivanova's shuttle leaves Babylon 5, Garibaldi is in his quarters,
   dressing, and watching an old Daffy Duck cartoon, in which Daffy is
   continually tormented by an unseen assailant, who is controlling his
   every move and the world around him. As the assailant is revealed to
   be Bugs Bunny, Garibaldi's door chimes and Wade enters. Wade tells
   Garibaldi that he has a job for him. He says he wants to hire
   Garibaldi as a bodyguard and expedite something secret. Wade explains
   that his contact has to perform important business on Babylon 5, which
   might involve security--all Garibaldi has to do is to keep the contact
   out of security's way while they are on board. Wade asks him if going
   against his own security force will be a problem, and Garibaldi tells
   him that--if he had asked that question the day before--he would have,
   but now he doesn't. Garibaldi agrees to the job.
   
   Ivanova's shuttle lands on Epsilon III, and she begins searching the
   corridors. She notices a being walking through the corridor and tells
   him she needs to see Draal. When she finally sees who it is, it's a
   familiar face--that of Zathras. She asks why he's there, and Zathras
   explains that he works there. She says that Zathras was left 1000
   years in the past, but Zathras insists they had never met before.
   Zathras laughs and explains that Ivanova didn't meet Zathras, but
   rather Zathras. This confuses Ivanova greatly, but Zathras explains
   that there are ten members in their family, each one named Zathras,
   but each one pronounced differently. Ivanova tells Zathras that she
   needs power to help the broadcast, and, though he laments the fact
   people always come to him for help, which he always provides, he does
   agree to help her.
   
   Garibaldi and Wade are walking through the corridors, finding the back
   way through the station to get to the docking area where they will
   meet the contact without security interfering. Wade explains that
   their contact decided to send his wife in his place so that she can
   prepare to take things over later. They find who they are looking for,
   and Garibaldi recognizes her instantly--it's Lise.
   
   Later, Garibaldi and Lise are alone in her quarters. He wants to know
   what happened in the meantime, and why she lost her first husband, and
   found another one. Lise explains that Franz was having an affair, and
   that he used the court system, which favors Earth-born people above
   those born on Mars, to file for divorce first. He got their daughter
   and remarried, and plans never to tell the child who her real mother
   is. Garibaldi is angry that she forgot all about him in her distress,
   but Lise insists she didn't forget--she knew he was happy here and
   didn't want to change that. Garibaldi tells her that she was his life
   at one point, but she says they're different people now. She explains
   that, six months earlier, she met Bill, and they got married.
   Garibaldi realizes she must mean William Edgars, one of the richest
   men on Earth. She insists that she didn't marry him because of his
   money, but Garibaldi no longer wants to talk about it. He says that he
   will, from that point on, only treat her as he would any client, and
   after she goes back to Mars, he is going to forget any of this
   happened, and now, he doesn't need to drink to do just that. Lise
   tells him that she's glad, but they are interrupted by Wade, telling
   them their shuttle is ready. The three of them leave.
   
   Londo is in Sheridan's office talking to him when G'Kar arrives.
   Neither ambassador is happy to see the other, but Sheridan says he
   needs them both there. Sheridan explains that commercial transports
   are being raided along the worlds in the League of Non-Aligned Worlds.
   Because of this, smaller worlds and empires are trying to rise to
   prominence, which is causing quite a few problems. In addition, there
   is the added problem of the Drakh, who are now on the loose with
   Shadow technology. Sheridan says that the Rangers no longer need to
   look out for the Shadows' return, but that he wants to use them to
   monitor the borders of the League borders, maintain the peace, and
   protect civilians. G'Kar feels that this could be seen as an act of
   aggression, but Sheridan says they will only go where they are
   invited, in exchange for technical support and the authority to carry
   out whatever they start. Londo agrees with G'Kar--this is not a good
   idea. Sheridan tells them that, if Londo and G'Kar both agree on this,
   that might help show the League worlds that this is something
   important. Londo is afraid it might be interpreted as a sign of
   weakness, but Sheridan says it should be interpreted as their trying
   to build something--to work together for a common goal. Londo says it
   isn't fair, and Sheridan agrees, and asks Londo if he wants to blood
   of the dead on his hands. He asks G'Kar as well, but neither responds.
   
   Zack enters his office and asks the computer for a status report. The
   computer reads off a list of fairly mundane things, except for one
   unauthorized entry, where 72 passengers disembarked a ship, but only
   71 went through security. Only one access was recorded to the customs
   bay--Security Chief Michael Garibaldi. Zack asks if more than one
   security identicard is registered to him, and the computer answers
   this affirmative. Zack orders the computer to cancel all identicards
   and security clearances belong to Garibaldi.
   
   Garibaldi, Wade, and Lise are waiting for their contact in Down Below.
   He eventually arrives, and hands over a secure cube--extremely
   difficult to open--containing a small vial. Garibaldi asks what it is,
   and though Wade initially resists, Lise explains that her husband has
   discovered there might be a genetic danger to some telepaths, and that
   this might be the cure to stop it. Wade explains that, in order to
   keep a panic from ensuing, they want to keep it quiet, since no one
   would believe that the disease can only be spread to telepaths. There
   are plenty of people who would want to have it for themselves, and
   they have invested far too much time and money to let it fall into the
   wrong hands. Garibaldi, looking around, finds that a group of people
   have noticed them. He tells the contact, Wade, and Lise that they all
   need to get out, but it's too late--they have been noticed. A
   firefight ensues, and the four of them run off, but are closely
   pursued. They are shot at from the front, and the contact is killed.
   
   Garibaldi ushers them into another room, and then bars the door. They
   try to exit out the back way, but Garibaldi's identicard no longer
   works. Their assailants try to bash in the door, but Garibaldi
   discovers another way out--he piles several crates on top of each
   other and then takes everyone through a panel in the ceiling, just as
   the assailants manage to break down the door. In the vents, Garibaldi
   tells Lise and Wade to go ahead without him, while he lies in wait for
   the others. They discover the hole in the ceiling, but when one of
   them comes through, he simply looks at Garibaldi for a few moments,
   but doesn't fire. He then vanishes down the grate. Garibaldi realizes
   the implications and chases after Wade and Lise. He catches up with
   them, and manages to pull them away just as PPG fire erupts through
   the floor of the vent. The fire eventually stops, and Garibaldi tells
   them that they need to go to Docking Bay 3--and to not stop thinking
   about it the entire time. They get where they are going, but it's not
   Docking Bay 3, just a corridor. Garibaldi explains that they must be
   using telepaths to track their movements. A security officer passes,
   and Garibaldi tells him that the shooters from Brown sector will be in
   Bay 3, and to meet him there. Garibaldi tells Wade and Lise to pick up
   a fake identicard and to get on the next transport out of there, while
   he goes to Bay 3. Lise doesn't want to leave him, but Garibaldi says
   she has to, and has Wade take her off. Garibaldi then runs off.
   
   It is dark in the abandoned Docking Bay 3, and the men who chased
   after Garibaldi, Lise, and Wade are there. Before long, Zack and his
   security team arrive. Zack demands to know who they are what they are
   doing, but only one of them has a reponse: "To the future." They both
   bite down on something, and fall to the floor. Zack calls MedLab, and
   tells them to get there quickly, but as he is doing so, Garibaldi
   arrives in the bay as well.
   
   Ivanova returns from Epsilon III to find Franklin waiting for her. He
   asks how it went, and she explains that she thinks she has the
   interface figured out. She wants to tell the Captain, but Franklin
   says he doesn't think it would be a good time at the moment--Sheridan
   is in a bad mood right now. As they leave, they pass Lise, who did
   arrive safely.
   
   Sheridan has both Zack and Garibaldi in his office, and demands to
   know what the deaths that occurred were about. Garibaldi says he
   doesn't know who they were, but that they just came at them, and
   killed the man who was supposed to meet with a client of his.
   Garibaldi tells Sheridan he can believe him or not, but either way, he
   won't say anything else. Sheridan tells Garibaldi that he jeopardized
   the station, but Garibaldi says that Sheridan nearly got him killed,
   and that it all could have been handled quietly had his identicard and
   gun not been taken. He didn't break any laws, though--Sheridan points
   out that he trespassed, violated security, and used an unauthorized
   identicard, but Garibaldi invites Sheridan to fine him, but that
   otherwise, he has nothing. Garibaldi starts to leave, but Sheridan
   tells him that Garibaldi is operating there because Sheridan is
   allowing him to, but should anything like that happen again, Sheridan
   will shut him down right away. Garibaldi doesn't say anything as he
   walks out. Garibaldi arrives back in his quarters, to find that he has
   a message waiting. He asks who it's from, and the computer replies
   that it's from Lise Hampton. Garibaldi tells the computer to delete
   the message, and then he goes to bed.
   
   Later, Garibaldi receives a transmission from William Edgars himself.
   Edgars tells him that Lise has arrived home safe, and that he heard
   about what Garibaldi did and how, and that he is appreciative for what
   he did. Edgars says that his organization could use Garibaldi, and
   that he would like to hire Garibaldi on retainer, though he would have
   to come to Mars, but it would definitely be worth his while. Edgars
   thinks there wouldn't be much problem getting him past the quarantine,
   and Edgars is sure he can work things out if Garibaldi is interested.
   "Yeah," Garibaldi says. "I'm interested."
   
   There is a brief flash of static, and then a test pattern appears on
   the screen, followed by Ivanova's face, in the war room.
   
   "This is Commander Susan Ivanova of Babylon 5, and this is the first
   official broadcast of the new Voice of the Resistance. We're sending
   this signal out to every ship that wants to hear the truth, to our
   fallen comrades and freedom fighters on Mars and Proxima III, and to
   Earth, which, despite what you may have heard, is still our home, and
   still the one dream that we're as loyal to now as we ever have been.
   Over the last three years, ever since President Clark took over, after
   arranging the assassination of President Santiago, you have been
   hearing nothing but misinformation, propaganda, and outright lies.
   Now, we're going to tell you the truth. And we're going to keep
   telling it until they shut us down, or until President Clark steps
   down and returns Earth to the hands of its people. You can kill us.
   You can bomb our colonies, destroy our ships, murder innocent
   civilians. But you cannot kill the truth. And the truth is back in
   business."
