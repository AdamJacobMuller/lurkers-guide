  Synopsis by Matthew Murray (mmurray@cc.wwu.edu)
  
   In the dark of an empty room, Sheridan is lying on the floor, asleep,
   voices floating through his dreams, reminding him of how he got there.
   Sheridan is rousted from his sleep when the single door to the room
   flies open, and from the light outside steps a man with a briefcase.
   He studies Sheridan as several of his associates bring in and set up a
   chair and a desk. "Do you have any allergies or illnesses I should be
   aware of? Are you currently taking any medication? Have you had any
   trouble with your heart?" Sheridan doesn't respond. "When I ask a
   question, you will respond at once. You will not hesitate, you will
   not consider, you will not lie. Cooperation will be rewarded,
   resistance will be punished. Do you understand?"
   
   Sheridan doesn't respond, but gets up and moves toward the man. When
   he gets fairly close, a device around Sheridan's neck causes him great
   pain, and he crumples to the floor. The man explains they are Narn
   paingivers, purchased during the war. The man explains that there is
   no reason to harm him, since he is not the enemy--he has no personal
   stake in what goes on. He is there only to do his job. He further
   explains that, though he has no desire to inflict pain, he will do so
   if it is required. He is not there to negotiate or assist him, but is
   there to ensure Sheridan's cooperation, and will use whatever means he
   feels are appropriate. He asks Sheridan if he understands, but
   Sheridan doesn't respond. The man pushes a button on his table, the
   door opens again, and two guards come in, force Sheridan into the
   chair, and shackle him down. The man asks Sheridan again if he
   understands, and Sheridan nods. "Do you any allergies or ilnesses I
   should be aware of? Are you currently taking any medication? Have you
   had any problems with your heart?"
   
   "No," Sheridan answers.
   
   "Good," the man replies. "Then we can begin."
   
   Sheridan is sitting in the chair, a bright light shining on his face,
   when the Interrogator returns, this time, with the outside shrouded in
   darkness. "Good morning," he tells Sheridan, but Sheridan believes
   that, since it is dark outside, it can't be morning, as it was before.
   The Interrogator walks to the door and demonstrates that it is he who
   controls the lighting, not the time of day. The Interrogator opens his
   briefcase and begins removing his effects when he appears to have
   forgotten something, and retrieves his glasses from the outside. He
   pushes a button on the table, causing Sheridan great pain. "Never
   contradict me," he says. The Interrogator begins looking over
   Sheridan's file, when he looks at his watch. He opens a small package
   in front of him, and removes a sandwich, which he begins to eat. As he
   eats, the Interrogator explains that he finds it interesting that
   Sheridan had never previously shown interest in politics, and Sheridan
   agrees--the Interrogator explains that, in that case, it is unlikely
   he would try to overthrow his own government without outside
   influence. Sheridan insists it's not true, but the Interrogator
   doesn't believe him, and asks if he is that far removed from other
   people. He says he will write that down as Sheridan's "first
   fabrication."
   
   The Interrogator asks Sheridan if he would like some of his sandwich;
   since they haven't fed Sheridan, and it is lunchtime, he would
   probably like some. Sheridan says that, a few moments ago, the
   Interrogator said it was morning, but the Interrogator insists that
   you can't have cornbeef sandwiches for breakfast. Sheridan concedes
   that it must be lunchtime somewhere, and takes the sandwich. The
   Interrogator promises Sheridan that the sandwich will not kill him,
   and Sheridan begins consuming the sandwich. The Interrogator explains
   that this proves that everything is a matter of perspective, the truth
   is fluid and subjective. "Out there, it doesn't matter what time it
   is. In here, it's lunchtime if you and I decide that it is. The truth
   is sometimes is what you believe it to be and sometimes what you
   decide it to be. My task... is to make you... decide to believe...
   differently. And when that happens, the world will remake itself
   before your very eyes." Sheridan insists it's not true, but, the
   Interrogator disagrees, explaining how the truth changed for Sheridan
   whenever there was a new enemy for him to fight. Sheridan denies this,
   but the Interrogator knows that a solider must accept what is ordered
   to believe, unless he is rejecting everything he claimed to stand for.
   
   Sheridan finishes the sandwich, and begins commenting on it, but the
   Interrogator claims he's being evasive. Sheridan says it's better than
   being dishonest. The Interrogator points out that, while Sheridan has
   changed the truth to suit himself, he has never lied to Sheridan. The
   Interrogator says that it's for supper, and he begins to pack up his
   things. As he does, he explains that, if you eat a little poison every
   day, you will gradually become used to it. The contents of the
   sandwich won't kill Sheridan, but the toxins will have their desired
   effects in a few minutes. "I'll be back when they've had a chance to
   clean up the place," the Interrogator tells him as he leaves.
   
   Sheridan is lying on the floor when the Interrogator returns, the next
   "morning." The Interrogator asks how is feeling, but Sheridan is too
   sick to respond. The Interrogator apologizes for poisoning him, but it
   is part of the process. "We have to break you physically before we can
   get to your mind." The Interrogator explains that the room is
   monitored throughout the day, and if Sheridan won't cooperate, he
   cannot be held responsible for what might happen. If Sheridan
   cooperates, the Interrogator promises, they will let him go. He
   removes a small flask and pours a drink for Sheridan, to help him out
   of his dehydration. Sheridan is apprehensive, but the Interrogator
   insists the drink is safe, and that, as Sheridan's only ally, he will
   tell him only the absolute truth. Sheridan begins to drink the liquid.
   
   The Interrogator explains that he needs to correct some ommissions in
   Sheridan's files, and begins asking if Susan Ivanova is still his
   second in command. They just want to confirm her name for the records,
   but Sheridan won't tell him, because the Interrogator wants it. The
   Interrogator insists he doesn't care, but his superiors want complete
   information. He asks Sheridan to sit in the chair, now that his
   strength has returned, which he does. As he sits, though, he finds
   himself automatically shackled in again. The Interrogator explains
   it's for Sheridan's own good. "Oh, by the way, I should mention your
   father... He sends his regards." The Interrogator says he's being held
   at another facility, and that he is alive and well. He suggests that
   Sheridan should thank him, which Sheridan does. He explains that he
   believes Sheridan's father will only be held as long as Sheridan is,
   but that they won't let him go if Sheridan continues to resist. The
   Interrogator asks if Sheridan has been interrogated before, but
   Sheridan says he would be surprised. The Interrogator finds this odd,
   as he seems to have forgotten the rules. He holds up a piece of paper.
   "This is your confession. It goes on at some length. So, uh, allow me
   to summarize. You plead guilty to charges of treason, mutiny,
   conspiracy to commit mutiny, sedition, terrorism..."
   
   "That's a lie!" Sheridan insists.
   
   "...conspiracy to overthrow the government, illegal seizure of Earth
   property, assault on fellow officers, sabotage..."
   
   "Now just a minute!"
   
   "...willful destruction of public property, disobeying direct orders
   of superior officers, and the murder of 547 officers and crew onboard
   the E.A.S. Roanoke!"
   
   "I won't sign it!"
   
   "You will sign it! You will sign it and you will read it aloud in full
   view of the public so they'll know we haven't forged your image or
   your signature. You will name your accomplices. You will apologize to
   the families and friends of those who have died fighting you. And in
   the end, you will beg for mercy on the grounds that you're under the
   influence of aliens who are trying subvert the government and
   undermine the authority of the President."
   
   "I demand to see an attorney! I demand the presence of a full military
   tribunal. You have no right..."
   
   "No, YOU have no rights! There's no courtroom here, Captain, no
   tribunals, no attorneys, no justice, no mercy, no fairness, no hope,
   no last-minute escape. You will walk through that door when you
   confess and not one second before!" With that, the Interrogator leaves
   the room.
   
   The door flings open and the Interrogator returns. "Good morning."
   After a few moments, two guards bring in a Drazi and strap him to the
   Interrogator's chair. The guards leave the three of them alone. The
   Interrogator places a recording device in front of the Drazi, and asks
   the Drazi to repeat what he previously told another interrogator. "I
   was one of those who was reponsible for manipulating Captain Sheridan
   into turning against his own government." Sheridan begs him not to
   continue, but the Drazi keeps talking. "I confess to taking part in
   the conspiracy to overturn your government." Sheridan tells the Drazi
   he's giving them exactly what they want, and the Interrogator
   agrees--when he's finished, they will let him go. The Drazi continues.
   "Those who worked with me in this conspiracy were Commander Susan
   Ivanova, Minbari Ambassador Delenn, Senator Ross Fowler..." The
   Interrogator explains that, while the Senator isn't involved, he has
   become a source of annoyance for the President. "I can personally
   verify all of the charges against him. However, Captain Sheridan was
   not responsible for his actions. He was not, uh, mentally
   competent..."
   
   Sheridan tries to convince the Drazi that however much they tortued
   him, he doesn't have to let them win, and begs him again not to
   confess. The Interrogator says he's Sheridan's alibi--the one chance
   he has of avoiding the death penalty, but Sheridan thinks that the
   Drazi are strong, and he shouldn't let them win. The Drazi insists
   there is nothing he can do, but Sheridan says that, if he resists, he
   will eventually win. The Drazi says he is afraid, and never has been
   before, but Sheridan pleads with the Drazi not to give them what they
   want. The Drazi looks at Sheridan for a few moments, and then tells
   the Interrogator he will not cooperate any further. Sheridan smiles
   smugly at the Interrogator.
   
   "Are you sure? You understand that this is your last chance?"
   
   "What are you doing," Sheridan asks.
   
   "Do you understand that this is your very... last... chance?"
   
   "Yes," the Drazi replies.
   
   The Interrogator touches a key on the table, and four guards enter
   with a gurney, which they strap the Drazi to. Sheridan protests, but
   they will not let him go. "Room 17," the Interrogator tells them as
   they wheel the Drazi out. The Interrogator returns to the subject of
   Ivanova, and will not tell Sheridan what they will do with the Drazi,
   despite Sheridan's demands that he do so. The Interrogator explains
   that, while the Drazi was expendable, Sheridan is not--his superiors
   want Sheridan honestly and sincerely broken if someone scans him. The
   apology must be sincere, and that would save them all time and
   trouble. As he is speaking, there is a scream in the background, and
   the lights of the room dim for a moment. The Interrogator begins
   packing up his things, and touches a button on the table. A recording
   of his own voice begins playing. "You will cooperate with the State
   for the good of the State and your own survival. You will confess to
   the crimes of which you have been accused. You will be released and
   returned to society a productive citizen if you cooperate. Resistance
   will be punished, cooperation will be rewarded." The Interrogator
   leaves for the "night," but his voice remains behind. "You will
   cooperate with the State for the good of the State and your own
   survival. You will confess to the crimes of which you have been
   accused. You will be released and returned to society a productive
   citizen if you cooperate..."
   
   The light of "day" streams in as the Interrogator returns. "...You
   will confess to the crimes of which you have been accused. You will be
   released and returned to society a productive citizen if you
   cooperate. Resistance will be punished, cooperation will be rewarded."
   The Interrogator shuts off the recording, and bids Sheridan "good
   morning." He tells Sheridan that, unless he starts cooperating, he
   won't be receiving any more of the intervenous nutrition he had been
   receiving since being taken off solid foods. The Interrogator puts
   Sheridan's "confession" down in front of him, telling him that that,
   and a few recorded words, are all that prevent him from leaving the
   cell. The Interrogator asks Sheridan if he wants to leave, if he wants
   to be free, and Sheridan admits he does. All he has to do is sign the
   confession. The Interrogator says they don't want him dead, but rather
   as a symbol. They will not kill him, though, at least not right
   away--they will wait until Sheridan has been forgotten. But, until
   that time, Sheridan will have his freedom--they will encourage him to
   travel, to spread the message that "you cannot beat the system." "Sign
   and speak," the Interrogator says, "and you can leave here." As
   Sheridan looks at the Interrogator, he sees Delenn standing behind
   him. He smiles at her, as the Interrogator releases his arms from the
   shackles. Sheridan looks at Delenn for the answer, but she says
   nothing to him--she then vanishes as quickly as she appeared. Sheridan
   stares at the confession for a few moments, then spits on it. He turns
   to the Interrogator and utters his response.
   
   "No."
   
   "I... I really wish you hadn't done that, Captain. I really...
   sincerely wish... you hadn't done that." The Interrogator picks up the
   confession and his briefcase, but cannot find words. "I... I... I have
   no control over what will happen next," he explains to Sheridan. "It's
   out of my hands." He walks out of the room, the door slamming shut
   behind him.
   
   The Interrogator bursts in and wakes Sheridan up. He tells Sheridan
   that they are doing this to him because he is a war hero, and he was
   made such in the public eye. People know him and recognize him, but
   when war heroes start believing certain things, the public listens,
   which threatens their credibility. And Sheridan's credibility needs to
   go--he says that the best way out for everyone is for Sheridan to
   confess and lay the blame on the alien governments. Whether it is
   really true or not, they can make the public believe it. They will let
   him live. But, it isn't the only way--they can forge Sheridan's image
   and his voice, after he has died. There will always be doubt that way,
   but the Interrogator explains that it is now an acceptable option. "I
   can save your life," the Interrogator says. "Right now. If you'll let
   me."
   
   Sheridan explains that he has considered the Interrogator's words,
   that you can't fight the system, but, if the truth is fluid and
   subjective, maybe you can, as long as one person refuses to break, or
   bow down.
   
   "But, can you win?" asks the Interrogator.
   
   "Every time I say no," responds Sheridan.
   
   The Interrogator moves away, back to his table. "Captain John
   Sheridan, will you, or will you not, sign a confession and endorse it
   before a public hearing?"
   
   "No."
   
   The Interrogator hits a key on the table, and four guards enter with a
   gurney, which they force Sheridan onto. He struggles, but can't
   escape. "You understand that this is your last chance?" the
   Interrogator asks as he bends over him. "Do you understand this is
   your very last chance?" Sheridan doesn't respond. "Room seventeen,"
   the Interrogator tells him. The gurney is wheeled down the hall.
   
   As Sheridan moves down the hall, a priest following him, reading him
   his Last Rites, he looks toward his goal--the door at the end of the
   hallway, through which light is streaming. In the middle of the light,
   Delenn is standing. Sheridan is wheeled closer, and closer...
   
   The gurney is placed in one half of the room, the other half obscured
   in shadows. Sheridan is unstrapped, and the guards leave. Sheridan
   sits up weakly, and looks into the other half of the room, where a
   figure in a black mask, black robe, and black gloves is standing
   before a large device, covered in a black cloth. The figure adjusts
   his glove and walks out. Sheridan is alone for a brief moment when
   four guards enter the room and remove him from the gurney. One of the
   guards removes the the cloth from the device in the corner, revealing
   it to be... a chair. An interrogation chair much like the one in the
   room he was in a few moments ago. He is forced into the chair and
   shackled down. The guards move the gurney closer to Sheridan, adjust
   it in a few ways, and it becomes a table exactly like the one in the
   other interrogation room. The guards leave the room, with only
   Sheridan and the shadowy figure remaining behind.
   
   Someone else comes in the room. "Good morning," the man says, placing
   his briefcase on the table. "Now, before we begin your interrogation,
   I'll need some information." Sheridan turns his gaze to the figure
   standing behind the new interrogator. "Do you have any allergies or
   illnesses that I should know about? Are you currently taking any
   medication?" The figure in black steps forward and removes his hood,
   revealing the Drazi that Sheridan had met in the other cell. "Any
   trouble with your heart?" The Drazi bows his head, but Sheridan is too
   stunned to respond to the interrogator's questions. "You will answer
   my questions when they are asked. Resistance will be punished,
   cooperation will be rewarded. Do you have any illnesses or allergies
   that I should know about? Are you currently taking any medication?
   Have you had any trouble with your heart?" Sheridan doesn't respond,
   but lowers his head and continues to listen. "You will answer my
   questions when they are asked. Resistance will be punished,
   cooperation will be rewarded. Do you have any allergies or illnesses
   that I should know about? Are you currently taking any medication?
   Have you had any trouble with your heart? You will answer my questions
   when they are asked. Resistance will be punished. Cooperation will be
   rewarded."
