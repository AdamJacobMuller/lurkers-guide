  Synopsis by Matthew Murray (mmurray@cc.wwu.edu)
  
   Garibaldi is asleep in his quarters when he receives a call from
   William Edgars. Edgars tells Garibaldi he has a new assignment: to
   make sure a new delivery coming through Babylon 5 gets through customs
   without incident and makes its way safely to Io. Edgars explains that
   he doesn't trust the government, the couriers, or his competitors to
   leave the packages--containing compounds for his pharmaceutical
   research department--alone. Garibaldi tells Edgars he will do the job,
   but asks when Edgars might want him to come to Mars. "In the fullness
   of time, Mr. Garibaldi," Edgars replies before signing off.
   
   Sheridan is in his quarters, unable to sleep. He calls C&C, asking if
   they have been able to contact Delenn on Minbar. They haven't, due to
   fighting in the capital city. Sheridan hasn't heard anything from her
   since she left, but asks to be informed if they learn anything new. He
   resumes trying to sleep.
   
   On Minbar, the capital city is in flames and most of the buildings are
   in ruins. Delenn arrives in the hallway of one of the buildings, where
   Lennier is treating some of the many wounded. Lennier tells her that
   they have received word from the leader of the Warrior Caste. "His
   forces have surrounded the city. He says, if we don't surrender by
   tomorrow, for the good of our people, he will end the war by
   destroying the city and everyone in it."
   
   Lyta is in the Zocalo with a woman who wants to hire her for freelance
   telepathy work. Though all of Lyta's qualifications are in order, the
   woman will not hire her when she learns that she is no longer
   affiliated with Psi Corps. Lyta protests, but the woman will not
   change her mind--her company needs to be protected from possible
   lawsuits and other problems. She says that, until Lyta rejoins Psi
   Corps, there is nothing she can do.
   
   Neroon arrives on one of the Warrior Caste ships and meets with the
   Caste's leader, Shakiri. Shakiri says that the actions of the
   Religious Caste--in trying to get Neroon to turn against the Warrior
   Caste--prove they are unfit to lead the Minbari. Neroon asks what the
   cost of the war will be. Shakiri tells him that the cities can be
   rebuilt, and that the Minbari who die in the city will be reborn into
   the next generation, but that those deaths will prevent a greater loss
   of life in the future. Shakiri says that war should be only be entered
   into for practical gains, and that the sooner the Religious Caste
   learns that--due to their actions in the Earth-Minbari war--the
   better. He thinks that, when Delenn sees the rest of her caste dying,
   she will surrender in order to end the loss of life. Neroon asks if it
   is wrong to value life in that manner, but Shakiri says that life and
   death are only two consequences, both equal, and that Warriors look
   upon death as a release of obligation. Shakiri tells Neroon to go
   rest.
   
   Zack is in the docking bay, trying to organize things, when he notices
   Garibaldi, off discreetly in the corner, dealing with another
   gentleman. He starts to investigate, but is interrupted by another
   security officer, asking what he should do about a new
   arrival--Bester. Zack asks why Bester is coming to the station this
   time. Bester insists he has not come to the station for any business
   with the Command Staff, but is there for personal reasons. He promises
   he will stay out of trouble, and though Zack tries to protest, Bester
   points out it is a free port, and that he has a right to be there.
   Zack tells Bester he has to check with the captain, and Bester
   promises to wait. Zack goes to do so, but on the way, investigates the
   corner where, a few moments earlier, he saw Garibaldi and the strange
   man, who are now gone. Zack runs after him and tries to find out where
   the package went, but Garibaldi insists he knows nothing about it.
   Zack asks if Garibaldi is working for William Edgars, bringing
   packages through illegally, but Garibaldi won't confirm or deny it.
   Zack asks why Edgars, an extremely wealthy and reclusive
   industrialist, would want to work with Garibaldi, which Garibaldi
   finds offensive--he is honest, and minding his own business. Zack asks
   how honest Garibaldi's work is, but Garibaldi finds it just as honest
   as breaking away from Earth, taking over military equipment, and
   starting their own independent state. Garibaldi tells Zack not to
   bother him, and leaves.
   
   Delenn is waiting for Lennier in one of the rooms in the capital
   building. When he arrives, Delenn tells him they have reached a
   decision, and she wants him to relay a message to the Warrior
   Caste--the Religious Caste is prepared to surrender, when and where
   the Warrior Caste wishes them to do so.
   
   "...And news has reached us that a squadron of Starfury pilots, sent
   to conduct raids against Proxima 3 in hopes of forcing them to accept
   President Clark's martial law decree, have defected, joining the
   Proxima resistance. This makes the fourth major defection in the last
   two weeks. Refugees from sectors 400 through 600 are being taken in by
   the medical colonies at Beta Iridani and the MacArthur midrange
   colony..."
   
   Lyta is interrupted watching the Voice of the Resistance in the Zocalo
   when Bester arrives. She is not very happy to see him, and tells him
   to say what he has to say and leave. Bester tells her he knows she is
   looking for work, since the corporations she wanted to work for called
   Psi Corps to check on her. Lyta tries to deny what he's saying, but he
   knows better--the command staff is getting along fine, but since Lyta
   has no support mechanism, her life of being a freelance freedom
   fighter isn't paying well enough for her to subsist much longer.
   Bester says he wants to make a deal with her--he will add her name to
   a list of deep undercover agents, allowing her to work and make a
   living. She will have to wear the symbol, the gloves, and give ten
   percent of her fees to the corps, and, after she dies, she will have
   to give her body to Bester. He knows that the Vorlons altered it, and
   that he feels that what they have done for her could be done for many
   more telepaths later, allowing them to be more than what they are. He
   shows her a contract, which he explains will be null and void if she
   doesn't die from natural causes, since Sheridan would never turn her
   body over otherwise. Lyta, however, is not impressed, and turns down
   his offer. She walks away, but is noticed by Garibaldi on her way out.
   
   Neroon tells Shakiri that the Religious Caste has agreed to surrender.
   In order to prove that the Warrior Caste intends to lead differently
   than the Grey Council, Neroon suggests that Shakiri accept the
   surrender on the planet, in the Temple of Varenni, where disputes were
   settled before Valen, and where new leaders were selected in times of
   war. In addition, the temple will distribute a record of the surrender
   throughout Minbar. Shakiri agrees. Neroon has one question: he wants
   to know what will happen to Delenn after the surrender. Shakiri says
   that, in order to prevent her working against them in the future, they
   will make sure the ship on which she travels to Babylon 5 after the
   surrender never reaches its destination.
   
   Lyta is making dinner in her quarters when Zack arrives. He tells her
   that Station Resources wants her to move to smaller quarters. Lyta is
   very upset, but Zack explains that, with the Vorlon government gone,
   she no longer has any source of income, and needs to leave. She is
   very upset, but says she will try to find some way of working it out.
   Zack is about ready to leave when he tells her that he needs to hire
   her for a job--he wants her to scan Garibaldi without his permission.
   Lyta is unwilling to do that, even for Zack. She might consider it if
   it were someone else, but the two of them go back a long way. No
   matter how much she needs the money, she isn't willing to violate
   everything she's been taught. Zack apologizes and leaves.
   
   Garibaldi is at his table, just finishing up with someone who wants
   Garibaldi to find his dog and cat, who are attempting to take over the
   galaxy. Lyta arrives and tells him that she needs a job, and that,
   because of her breaking with the Psi Corps, she can't get work with
   anyone she trusts. Garibaldi explains to her that he doesn't use
   telepaths, and doesn't trust them, but notes that, should he hire her,
   he can also annoy Bester. He asks how wide her range is, and she
   explains that it is much further than official records indicate.
   Garibaldi says that he needs someone who can watch out for him in his
   dealings with Edgars. Garibaldi agrees to give her a portion of his
   own salary, but is interrupted when Bester arrives. They exchange a
   few words, but Bester claims that Garibaldi is no longer worth his
   attention, and begins walking away. As he walks by, Lyta tells
   Garibaldi that Bester scanned him. This outrages Garibaldi who chases
   after him and backs him against a wall. He demands to know why Bester
   scanned him, but his anger is noticed by some security guards, who
   restrain him and drag him away. As Lyta chases after him, Bester finds
   that Zack, too, saw the whole thing.
   
   Delenn, Lennier, and some other members of the Religious Caste, are
   walking toward the temple. Lennier laments that they are surrendering,
   but Delenn says that the day is not yet over. She gives him a small
   tube, and says all the instructions are inside. They enter the temple.
   The rite of surrender begins, and Shakiri tells Delenn that this day
   is the beginning of a new age for their people, and that the
   hostilities can finally stop. She says that she speaks for the
   Religious Caste, and that they surrender. This overjoys Shakiri, who
   starts talking about rebuilding their cities and the Grey Council.
   Delenn, however, is not finished. She says that the Religious Caste
   does not give up their sovereign right to form a new government. She
   says that Dukhat found no dishonor in surrender, and the she
   recognizes the superior forces of the Warrior Caste, that the
   Religious Caste helped to arm and train. Though the Warrior Caste may
   be stronger, they aren't necessarily wiser. She says that she doesn't
   want to throw away all they have done for the past thousand years, and
   that the Temple of Varenni was used to bring the reality of war to its
   leaders, and not just those who fight and die on the front lines. She
   makes a gesture, and a hole in the ceiling opens, casting a bright
   white light into the circle on the floor. She explains that, if they
   are ignoring the wisdom of Valen, they must completely return to the
   ways of the Ancients. The leader of each of the warring castes would
   step into the circle on the floor, and the Starfire Wheel would open,
   and its fire begin to destroy the leaders. Those who were afraid would
   send others to enter the fire, or escape, and whoever reamined in the
   fire to sacrifice their life would be representative of the true Caste
   that should lead the Minbari people. Shakiri vehemently objects, but
   Delenn insists it's tradition, and that she is willing to endure the
   Starfire Wheel for the good of the Minbari people. If the Warrior
   Caste will not do likewise, they don't deserve to lead. She steps into
   the circle of light on the floor. "Valen said, 'Will you follow me
   into fire?'" she says. "Will you?"
   
   Lennier protests, but Delenn will not move, and instead begs Lennier
   to carry out her instructions should she die. Shakiri doesn't move, so
   Delenn asks if he concedes leadership, if it is too easy to send
   others to die for him, but that he isn't willing to die for his Caste.
   The Starfire Wheel opens further, and the light around Delenn grows
   stronger. Shakiri insists that the entire thing is madness and
   refuses, but Neroon points out that Shakiri said that a Warrior does
   not fear death, and asks why he is afraid. Shakiri asks if he speaks
   for the Religious Caste, but Neroon says he speaks for their people,
   and wants to know who he speaks for, and what he is willing to do--the
   other Minbari people, all watching, want to know as well. Shakiri
   steps forward and enters the light, as the Starfire wheel opens
   further. Shakiri tries to convince Delenn to walk out with him, but
   she refuses--he insists there are other ways, but Delenn says he
   should have thought of that before he tore the Minbari people apart.
   Shakiri jumps from the light, but Delenn does not leave, as Neroon
   tells Lennier she promised to do. Lennier says she is making a point,
   for all Minbari. The Starfire Wheel opens further, nearly all the way,
   and Delenn is no longer able to withstand its force.
   
   "No!" cries Neroon as he runs forth. He forces himself into the light,
   picks up Delenn, and hands her through the light to Lennier. Standing
   in the flame, he cries out, "I was born Warrior Caste, but I see
   now... The calling of my heart... is Religious! The war is over!
   Listen to her! Listen!" The Starfire Wheel opens completely, and the
   light utterly engulfs him. In mere seconds, he is gone, and only the
   smoking circle, where he once stood, remains.
   
   Garibaldi is again asleep in his quarters when another message from
   Edgars wakes him up. Though he is very upset, he manages to contain
   his anger long enough to listen to Edgars. He has found out that
   Garibaldi has hired Lyta, and doesn't want her to work for Garibaldi
   if Garibaldi is working for him. Garibaldi asks why Edgars wants to
   help telepaths, but not to employ them. Edgars says he doesn't trust
   telepaths. He says that, if Garibaldi wants to keep his job, Lyta must
   not work for him.
   
   Bester is in the Zocalo watching Lyta and Garibaldi have a heated
   discussion. Lyta becomes very angry and storms away from the table, as
   Bester simply sits and smiles. "Personal log: Bester, Al. August 3rd,
   2261. By provoking Mr. Garibaldi, I have put him even further at odds
   with his former associates, and further on the path I need him to
   folow. What I came here to get, I got--even her." We now see Lyta
   inside her quarters, wearing long black gloves, and the PsiCorps
   symbol on her chest. Bester's contract is lying nearby, as she sadly
   looks at what she has once again become in the mirror. "Guess you
   could call it a bank shot," Bester continues. "Yes... I've had a nice
   day."
   
   On the Grey Council ship, Lennier tries to convince Delenn that she
   should wait before doing what she is planning, but she won't postpone
   it a moment longer. Lennier says that, when she enters the Council
   Chamber, what transpires will be broadcast all over Minbar.
   
   She enters the chamber where the nine circles of light surround one in
   the middle. None of them are occupied. She steps into the center
   light, and proclaims that she is about to restore the Grey Council.
   She calls forth the members of the new Grey Council--two Religious,
   and two Warrior. There are still five spaces vacant, but the tradition
   must be broken-- there can no longer be three of each Caste. She calls
   forth five other Minbari, all from the Worker Caste. She explains
   that, when the Religious Caste and the Warrior Caste fight, the
   Workers are caught in the middle--they build the ships for fighting
   and the temples for praying, and they look to the other Castes to
   guide their hands. The Workers want to do only what is best, and, from
   now on, the Religious and Warrior Castes will be in the service of the
   people, not the other way around. She steps from the center circle of
   light, and explains that it is reserved in memory of Neroon, until the
   time it will be filled by the one who is to come. She advises the
   Council to judge wisely and well, as the leader of the Minbari, then
   leaves so that the Council may begin.
   
   Ivanova comes into Sheridan's quarters, in a fury. She holds up a data
   crystal and explains that it was taken by a transport bringing relief
   supplies to Proxima 3. The crystal contains footage of an Earth Force
   destroyer decimating a convoy of unarmed transports. She says that the
   transports indentified themselves as only carrying wounded refugees,
   over 10,000 civilians in all. She says she's going to put the video on
   Voice of the Resistance as soon as she calms down.
   
   Sheridan, likewise, is outraged. "This madness has gone on long
   enough. I don't care if we're not ready, I don't care if we're
   outnumbered or outgunned, I don't care what ISN says about us. This
   stops, and it stops now! Now, if earth wants to declare war on us,
   then it is time that we took the war to Clark. You tell the others...
   Starting right now, we fight back and we fight back hard!"
   
   "I thought you were looking for some other way than firing at our own
   ships," Ivanova asks. "They were following orders."
   
   "Any crew that executes an order like that is guilty of war crimes,
   and they deserve whatever they get," Sheridan continues. "No, we're
   riding in, Susan. Anybody who wants to defect and join us, fine. If
   they get in our way, we will knock them down. If they kill one of our
   ships, we'll kill three of theirs. And we keep going. We never slow
   down, and we won't stop... We're going after the colonies, then
   Mars... and then Earth. And God help anybody who gets in our way."
