  Synopsis by Matthew Murray (mmurray@wsu.edu)
  
   Garibaldi and Zack Allen are supervising the recent influx of Narn
   refugees. The station is running out of space and resources to treat
   the many injured refugees from the Narn-Centauri war before they are
   fit to return to the Narn homeworld. Zack suggests trying to move them
   out sooner, but Garibaldi tells him that is against Captain Sheridan's
   orders. Because Medlab is swamped, Zack asks Garibaldi to speak to
   Sheridan about the matter.
   
   Vir, outside the Zocalo, finds Morden sitting at a table. Morden says
   that he was expecting Londo instead, but Vir explains that Londo was
   recalled to Centauri Prime for a consultation about the war effort.
   Morden tells Vir he doesn't understand why Vir doesn't like him, since
   he is doing so much to help out the Centauri. Vir asks why Morden sent
   for him.
   
   "I sent for Ambassador Mollari," Morden tells him. "But you're here,
   he's not, and it can wait. If restoring the Centauri Republic means
   nothing to you, what does? What do you want?"
   
   [INLINE] "I'd like to live just long enough to be there when they cut
   off your head and stick it on a pike, as a warning to the next ten
   generations that some favors come with too high a price," Vir answers.
   "I want to look up into your lifeless eyes and wave like this. Can you
   and your associates arrange that for me, Mr. Morden?"
   
   Morden doesn't reply, but hands Vir a data crystal with information
   for Londo. As Vir is leaving, he waves to Morden, as he hopes to do
   after Morden is dead.
   
   Garibaldi enters Sheridan's office and asks him for some discretionary
   power over the Narn refugees. Sheridan tells him that he assumed the
   station could handle the problem, and that it is hard to turn any of
   them away. He instructs Garibaldi to have Dr. Franklin sort through
   everyone, give them only as much treatment as they need, and then send
   them off as soon as possible. Garibaldi agrees, saying that it will
   not make Earth Central happy. Garibaldi notices a monitor on the wall,
   which contains a diagram of the Icarus, the ship Anna Sheridan was on
   when she died. Sheridan explains that he is trying to sort through the
   rest of his wife's possession, and was going over the mission
   information she sent him. Garibaldi expresses his regret, and asks to
   look at the information. While filing through the crew manifest, he
   sees a face he recognizes. Sheridan at first protests, saying that
   everyone on the ship died with Anna, but Garibaldi insists he knows
   better. "Captain, I know what I'm talking about. I've seen him before.
   He's alive." He shows the Captain the picture he recognizes. It's
   Morden.
   
   Garibaldi insists that he knows Morden, which makes Sheridan extremely
   upset, since Morden should be dead. Sheridan asks why the security net
   didn't catch him, and Garibaldi explains that, since they don't get
   death certificates on everyone, Morden would not be found out unless
   he broke station rules, which he hasn't done. Sheridan orders
   Garibaldi to find Morden.
   
   [INLINE] Talia is in her quarters when her door chimes. A man enters
   and introduces himself as Pierce MacAfee. She greets him and asks what
   she can do for him. He explains that he is from the Ministry of Peace
   on Earth and would like her support for a series of new programs. He
   explains that the objective of the Ministry of Peace is to help humans
   find peace with themselves, so it will be easier to attain peace with
   other planets. He tells her that he will be giving a series of
   presentations about the programs, and that, because she was
   recommended to him by her superiors, he would like her to attend. She
   agrees.
   
   Dr. Franklin is in his office listening to medical reports, and barely
   able to keep his eyes open when Ivanova enters and notes that he
   hasn't slept in 36 hours. He tells her that he has to keep working,
   but she suggests he have someone else take over. When he tries to
   protest, she orders him to get some sleep and then join her in the
   mess hall for breakfast afterwards. Though he initially protests, he
   eventually agrees, and leaves to get some sleep.
   
   [INLINE] A line of people are having their identicards checked by Zack
   Allen. Morden gives his card to Zack, and is instructed to step out of
   line and wait for a moment. Morden tries to avoid doing so, but when
   he tries to leave, he is surrounded by several security guards.
   
   Sheridan sits across a table from Morden, saying nothing. Morden says
   that it is traditional to charge someone if they are being held.
   Sheridan says nothing, but produces a picture of his wife and gives it
   to Morden. Morden asks what the picture is supposed to mean, and
   Sheridan's only reply is to show a news report on the Icarus. Morden
   finally understands the matter, and he explains that he was on board
   the Icarus, but doesn't remember what happened. He was in an EVA suit,
   unconscious, when a transport came to investigate the Icarus'
   disappearance. The shock and trauma of whatever happened erased his
   memory. Sheridan asks why Morden didn't check in with Earth Central,
   and Morden says that it took him a long time to remember his name, let
   alone file a report. He claims he sent a message, but that it must
   never have been recieved. Sheridan calls him a liar, and Morden tries
   to leave, but Sheridan won't let him.
   
   [INLINE] "You're not going anywhere."
   
   Morden reminds Sheridan that he can't be held without charges.
   Sheridan explains that, since Morden is officially "dead," he has no
   rights and no legal recourse. "You're playing a very dangerous game,
   Captain," Morden tells him. "It could cost you your command." Sheridan
   insists that Morden won't be leaving until he tells the truth.
   
   [INLINE] Ivanova and Franklin sit together in the mess hall, finishing
   their breakfast. Franklin mentions that he had bad dreams, dreams of
   the patients he's lost. Ivanova agrees that it is difficult to think
   about all of the Narn refugees since, by the time they arrive, they
   are behind help. Franklin asks her if she believes in God, and she
   tells him that most of the time, she does. Franklin tells her that he
   is a foundationist, and believes that "God is too big to be defined by
   words" and that "the closer you get to defining God, the further away
   it gets." She asks what this has to do with his dreams, and Franklin
   tells her that, just before patients die, he can see God reflected in
   their eyes. "I've seen a lot of reflected Gods today, Susan, and I'm
   wondering how we can keep believing in them when they've stopped
   believing in us."
   
   [INLINE] Sheridan continues his interrogation of Morden, finding
   discrepancies in his story as they continue. As it continues, Sheridan
   becomes more angry and more tyrannical. Sheridan asks what happened to
   the Icarus, but Morden claims he doesn't know. Sheridan tells Morden
   that, by the time he is through, Morden will wish he had died with the
   others.
   
   [INLINE] Pierce MacAfee addresses a group of people in a conference
   room, explaining about the Ministry of Peace. He explains that its
   objective is to help people find peace with themselves. Looking at
   Babylon 5 as a microcosm of Earth, MacAfee explains they have
   developed a system called the Night Watch, the purpose of which is to
   detect possible problems. He says it is a volunteer organization, and
   that it pays fifty credits a week. All they need to do is wear a black
   armband, so that people know the Night Watch is around. The Ministry
   of Peace wants to raise public awareness and help people think about
   peace. Zack Allen, sitting near Talia in the audience, asks what else
   is entailed by being in the Night Watch. MacAfee says that those that
   work against peace simply don't know any better, and they need to be
   taught and rehabilitated; it's up to the Night Watch to spot such
   people and report them. By doing this, they can protect society from
   harmful ideas and misinformation. "We're less interested in actions
   than we are in attitudes," MacAfee tells them. "We must help protect
   society against its own worst instincts." He says he is proud to be a
   part of the organization, and hopes that the others will join him.
   
   Sheridan goes to Garibaldi's office. He tells Garibaldi that he's
   close to getting the truth out of Morden -- all he needs is to find
   one provable lie in Morden's story. Garibaldi points out that Sheridan
   has had Morden locked up for ten hours without charges, which is
   blatantly illegal. He offers to have Morden followed, but Sheridan
   refuses. The two argue about regulations. Finally, Garibaldi says he
   can't be present as chief of security while something like this is
   going on, and threatens to resign if Sheridan persists. Sheridan says
   nothing. Garibaldi lays down his PPG, security card, and link, and
   leaves the room.
   
   Sheridan is still sitting in Garibaldi's office when Zack Allen
   enters. Sheridan tells Zack that Garibaldi has taken a leave of
   absence, and that he wants him in charge of Morden until Garibaldi's
   return. Zack agrees, and Sheridan receives a call from C&C saying that
   Vir Cotto wants to meet with him. Sheridan says he will meet with Vir
   in ten minutes. Before he leaves, Sheridan asks Zack to bring Talia to
   the office so that he may speak with her.
   
   [INLINE] Sheridan meets with Vir. Vir says he's come to ask that
   Morden be released; this stuns Sheridan, who asks how Vir knows
   Morden. Vir is vague on the subject. Sheridan asks why Vir thinks the
   station personnel have Morden. Vir replies that Morden didn't show up
   for a meeting, and since the records show he's still on the station,
   he deduced that Sheridan's people had Morden. Morden is a guest of the
   Centauri Republic, Vir continues, and is thus eligible for diplomatic
   immunity. This stuns Sheridan, and he asks why Morden is so important
   to the Centauri Republic. Vir says that it is an internal matter, and
   once again asks for Morden's release, but Sheridan refuses, on the
   grounds that diplomatic immunity only applies once charges are filed.
   Morden, Sheridan says, is in protective custody. "Protecting him from
   what?" asks Vir. "I haven't decided yet," Sheridan says, and leaves.
   
   As Sheridan walks down a corridor, Ivanova catches up with him. She
   tells him that she was briefed by Garibaldi, and is worried about
   Sheridan's behavior. Sheridan tells her that he knows he may be acting
   inappropriately, but that Anna meant a lot to him, and that he can
   simply not let that part of his life vanish away so easily now that he
   has proof her death may have been something more than an accident --
   if she even _is_ dead. He says that he has to know, and that nothing
   else matters to him.
   
   Talia apologizes, but tells Sheridan that she can't help him. She says
   that Psi Corps rules do not permit unauthorized scans in these
   circumstances. Sheridan tries to get around the regulations by
   pointing out that Morden is "officially" dead, but Talia still doesn't
   agree to his wishes. She says that she can do nothing unless he agrees
   to a scan. Sheridan asks her to wait outside, then tells Zack Allen to
   move Morden to a holding cell and escort Talia back to her quarters
   through a section of the station that will cause the two of them to
   pass each other.
   
   [INLINE] Morden moves down the hall slowly, accompanied by a full
   security escort. When he and Talia meet, their gazes lock, and she
   sees his face become hidden in shadows. She holds her hands to her
   head and screams, and tries to avert her gaze, but not before she sees
   the vague outlines of two strangely-shaped beings next to Morden. She
   falls back into Zack's arms.
   
   Dr. Franklin examines Talia, who insists she's all right, but says
   that, when she looked at Morden, she felt as if she were falling into
   a bottomless well, and that she felt a great coldness. She also says
   she thought she saw a shape with him. Sheridan enters and begins to
   apologize, but cannot finish before she slaps him full across the face
   and storms out. Sheridan tells Franklin he had it coming, and Franklin
   agrees. Franklin gives Sheridan some advice. He knows very well how
   people act when someone they love dies, but it's not always possible
   to do anything about it, even if Sheridan sometimes thinks he can fix
   everything. He says Sheridan has to face that fact, but he doesn't
   have to do it alone. Sheridan smiles in understanding and leaves.
   
   He is barely outside of MedLab when Delenn and Kosh appear. Delenn
   tells Sheridan that Morden must be released at once. Sheridan can't
   believe that they are interested in Morden as well, and wants to know
   why everyone is so interested in him. Delenn says that Babylon 5 could
   be in terrible danger, and that Sheridan will have to trust them, but
   that isn't enough for Sheridan. He demands answers. Delenn and Kosh
   look at each other, and Kosh nods to her. She agrees to give Sheridan
   the answers he wants, but warns him that, when he learns what they
   know, he will never be able to sleep well again. "Come, Captain," she
   says. "The greatest nightmare of our time is waiting for you." She
   hurries off, followed by Kosh, and Sheridan is close behind.
   
   [INLINE] "There are beings in the universe billions of years older
   than either of our races," Delenn begins. "Once, long ago, they walked
   among the stars like giants... vast and timeless. They taught the
   younger races, explored beyond the rim, created great empires... But
   to all things there is an end. Slowly, over a million years, the First
   Ones went away. Some passed beyond the stars, never to return. Some
   simply disappeared."
   
   Sheridan, impatient, interrupts. "Delenn, I'm sure this is all very
   interesting, but what does any of this have to do with Morden?"
   
   "Not all of the First Ones have gone away. A few stayed behind, hidden
   or asleep, waiting for the day when they may be needed...when the
   Shadows come again."
   
   "Shadows?"
   
   "We have no other name for them. The Shadows were old when even the
   Ancients were young. They battled one another over and over across a
   million years. The last great war against the Shadows was ten thousand
   years ago. It was the last time the Ancients walked openly among us.
   The Shadows were only defeated, not destroyed. A thousand years ago,
   the Shadows returned to their places of power, rebuilt them, and began
   to stretch forth their hand. Before they could strike, they were
   defeated by an alliance of worlds, including the Minbari... and the
   few remaining First Ones who had not yet passed beyond the Veil. When
   they had finished, the First Ones went away... all but one."
   
   "There's still one of them left. Where?"
   
   Delenn, saying nothing, slowly focuses her gaze upon Kosh. "That is
   why Kosh cannot leave his encounter suit. He would be recognized."
   
   "Recognized? By who?"
   
   "Everyone," Kosh intones.
   
   "For centuries, the Vorlons stood alone, the last remaining Guardians,
   watching and waiting. Then, last year, I sent Kosh a message." Delenn
   tells Sheridan of the time, before she began her transformation, that
   she sent Lennier to Kosh with a question, to which Kosh answered yes.
   
   "If yes was the answer, what was the question?" Sheridan asks.
   
   "'Have the Shadows returned to Z'ha'dum?'" She tells him.
   
   "Z'ha'dum?" Sheridan says. "That's the world G'kar's been warning us
   about all year."
   
   "Sheridan," intones Kosh, as the small circular opening in his
   headpiece opens. "Learn."
   
   [INLINE] Sheridan looks into the hole, and his face is covered by a
   strange green light. He sees a spaceship approaching a world.
   
   "The Icarus," Delenn says, "your wife's ship, sent to investigate the
   ruins of an ancient race no one has ever heard of before."
   
   "Z'ha'dum," Kosh says.
   
   Sheridan, still mesmerized by a strange light from the encounter suit,
   sees the crew of the Icarus, on the surface of Z'ha'dum, exploring the
   planet. He sees inside a great crevice, where a strange and terrifying
   creature stirs, eventually opening its fiery eyes.
   
   [INLINE] [INLINE] [INLINE]
   
   As the Shadow awakens, the opening in the headpiece of the encounter
   suit closes, and Sheridan returns his focus to Delenn. "Anna...The
   Icarus," he says weakly, "They found something. They woke something
   up."
   
   "Yes," Delenn says. "Once awakened, the Shadows could not allow them
   to leave in case they would warn others. Those who would not serve
   were killed."
   
   "But were they all killed? Delenn, maybe... maybe some of them were
   kept alive as prisoners. Anna might still be alive! Morden..."
   
   "...must be released!"
   
   "After what you just showed me, how can you ask me to let him go?"
   
   "Because right now, they do not know how much we know. The last time,
   the Shadows lost because they moved too quickly. Now, they are being
   careful, gathering their forces slowly. If you push Morden, sooner or
   later, he will tell you what happened. Then he will be killed. And you
   will be killed. The Shadows will move now, before we're ready for
   them."
   
   "How are they going to know?"
   
   "Because Morden is never alone! Listen to me. Aside from the Vorlons,
   we do not have the First Ones to help us this time. We are on our own!
   We will have only one chance to stop them, and if we fail, billions
   will die. There comes a moment when each of us must pledge himself to
   something greater than himself. You told G'kar he had to decide
   between revenge and the good of his own people. Now you must make the
   same decision, Captain. It will be the most important decision of your
   life."
   
   Zack tells Sheridan, who is watching Morden in his cell, that he
   should get some sleep. Sheridan asks Zack how much he knows about
   World War II, but Zack admits he doesn't know much. Sheridan tells him
   how the British government knew, throughout most of the war, the code
   that the Germans used for all their secret messages. The British
   discovered that the Germans were planning to bomb Coventry, but if
   they evacuated, the Germans would change the code. If the city weren't
   evacuated, hundreds would die. The British decided not to evacuate,
   and the city was destroyed. Sheridan says he saw an old newsreel of
   Churchill visiting Coventry, and is still haunted by the look in
   Churchill's eyes as he realized what he had done. Zack says he's glad
   he doesn't have to make that decision, because he doesn't think he
   could handle it. "How many lives is a secret worth?" he asks. A
   strange sound comes from the monitor on which Sheridan is watching
   Morden. Zack explains they had been picking up the sound for a while,
   but that they believe it is due to faulty microphones in the cell.
   Sheridan asks Zack to change the view on the monitor to scan for
   different wavelengths of light. Zack does so, and while he's doing it,
   Sheridan sees three spider-like black creatures in the room for a
   brief moment.
   
   [INLINE]
   
   "What did you see?" asks Zack.
   
   "Nothing," Sheridan replies. "Shadows." He tells Zack to free Morden,
   and tell him it was all a mistake, and that he is free to leave if he
   chooses. Zack leaves as Sheridan continues to study Morden's face.
   
   Garibaldi is eating when Sheridan approaches and returns all his
   security equipment. Sheridan explains that he freed Morden, and that
   Garibaldi was correct. Garibaldi asks why Sheridan changed his mind,
   but Sheridan won't say. Garibaldi says that makes him uncomfortable,
   but hopes that, the next time something similar happens, Sheridan will
   listen to him. Sheridan assures him there won't be a next time.
   Garibaldi asks if Sheridan is okay as he leaves, and Sheridan claims
   he is. Zack Allen approaches Garibaldi and asks if Sheridan is all
   right. Garibaldi says he doesn't know, and then asks Zack about the
   arm band he is wearing, which displays the colors of the Ministry of
   Peace. Zack says that fifty credits more per week, for doing what he
   does anyway, is a good deal.
   
   [INLINE] Sheridan, wearing an oxygen mask, enters Kosh's quarters. "I
   let him go," he tells the Ambassador. "But there is a price tag
   attached. You've been trying to help me so we can understand each
   other. That's not what I want any more. I want you to teach me how to
   fight them, how to beat them. Because sooner or later, I'm going to
   Z'ha'dum, and I'm going to stop them."
   
   "If you go to Z'ha'dum, you will die," Kosh warns.
   
   "Then I die," Sheridan tells him. "But I will not go down easily, and
   I will not go down alone. You will teach me?"
   
   Kosh has but one answer for this question. "Yes."
