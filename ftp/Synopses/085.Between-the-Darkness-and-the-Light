  Synopsis by Katrina Glerum (kat@midwinter.com)
  
   Seated at a small, bare table in the Captain's quarters, Franklin asks
   Sheridan how he managed to escape. Who were his contacts in the
   Resistance? Sheridan peers at him suspiciously. It isn't Franklin.
   It's an interrogator and they are still in Sheridan's cell. Drugged
   and weary, Sheridan's mind keeps shifting the location and persons
   from the station to prison. The brainwashing hasn't succeeded though.
   The Captain hasn't been convinced that he is under the control of
   aliens.
   
   In a busy shipping station on Mars, Garibaldi meets up with his
   contact. Apparently the Resistance doesn't believe that Sheridan's
   kidnapping wasn't Garibaldi's fault. Several men leap out of the
   shadows and beat him senseless. At their headquarters, Number One
   offers Franklin a gun and the chance for revenge. "Steven?" Garibaldi
   shouts when Franklin refuses. Instead Franklin rips the hood off
   Garibaldi's head and angrily demands an explanation.
   
   Garibaldi stammers out how he was used by Bester, but only Lyta seems
   willing to believe it. Garibaldi tells them that he knows where
   Sheridan is being held, and they can get him out. But it's the same
   story he used to lure Sheridan in the first place. Garibaldi pleads,
   "You can't let Bester screw up my entire life and not give me the
   chance to fix it. I can't go out this way!" Franklin is disgusted.
   Seeing Lyta, Garibaldi begs her to scan him. She replies that no one
   trusts telepaths here. Franklin wants to try it, but Number One
   angrily decides just to shoot Garibaldi. Franklin grabs her gun as it
   goes off, and Lyta snatches a rifle, spraying the ceiling with fire.
   In the uneasy pause, Franklin covers Number One with the rifle while
   Lyta goes to work on Garibaldi's head.
   
   She immediately finds Psi Cop blocks. Her eyes go full black as she
   pushes harder until she finds the memories Bester concealed. When she
   announces this, Number One scoffs. Furious, Lyta whips around, fixes
   Number One with her eerie eyes, and convinces her with a rapid
   braindump of Garibaldi's hellish experience.
   
   The White Star fleet engages and disables another two destroyers.
   Ivanova orders the backup units to proceed with the evacuation while
   the main fleet heads for the next target. When Marcus questions
   whether they are advancing too slowly, she insists that this is the
   one chance these crews will receive justice for their actions, and
   besides, defectors will be needed when they hit Earth.
   
   Garibaldi shows Number One where Sheridan is being held. She says that
   her people can get them inside, but they're on their own after that.
   
   On B5, a rather worried Lennier finds Delenn and informs her that
   Mollari has called a full Council meeting without informing the
   Minbari. The Centauri is just calling for a vote on an intolerable
   situation, when Delenn arrives. It's unanimous, and with a
   representative from Minbar present, it's even legitimate.
   
   "The humans have become the glue which holds us together," G'Kar
   explains when Delenn objects. The Council feels it is their
   responsibility to do everything in their power to prevent Earth from
   turning in upon itself, as well as to repay the debt they owe Sheridan
   for his defense of their planets during the Shadow War.
   
   In Delenn's stunned silence, G'Kar, Londo and Vir explain that they
   have resolved to unite their forces to aid Ivanova's fleet, but they
   didn't want to tell her until it was fait acompli, lest people say it
   was based on personal interests.
   
   The Resistance fighter leads Garibaldi, Franklin and Lyta through old
   access tunnels to the location where Sheridan is being held, but
   refuses to accompany them further.
   
   Marcus brings the duty officer from one of the disabled ships on the
   bridge with the claim that he has critical intelligence. Apparently
   some of the "allies" they've picked up along the way are not real
   defectors. Ivanova's intention to rendezvous near Mars for the final
   assault on Earth, has been passed back to Clark, who has arranged to
   ambush them with a fleet of new advanced-technology destroyers.
   Ivanova and Marcus realize that their standard Earth Force allies
   would be annihilated by an advanced destroyer fleet. There's no time
   to change the rendezvous, so Ivanova decides that the White Stars must
   try to take out the force alone.
   
   Garibaldi and Franklin jump a patrol in the tunnels. They win, but
   Garbaldi takes a knife in the back. Franklin stitches the wound
   crudely, but can't convince Garibaldi to stay behind.
   
   Captain James of the Agamemnon tries in vain to argue Ivanova out of
   her decision. As soon as they set off, Marcus tries to convince
   Ivanova to get some rest. He only succeeds by threatening to harry her
   until she gives in. She agrees as long as he wakes her later and
   sleeps as well.
   
   Wearing their old Earth Force uniforms, Garibaldi and crew stroll up
   to the prison guard booth. The guard recognizes Garibaldi and commends
   him for turning Sheridan in. He accepts Garibaldi's story about being
   there to interrogate the prisoner and lets them pass.
   
   The two cell guards stop them. Garibaldi casually mentions the lock
   "code" and Lyta grabs it from a guard's mind before attacking the
   second guard with the thought of pain. Garibaldi takes out the other
   one, but blood is now showing through his uniform. They hurry into the
   cell and Franklin sets to work trying to revive Sheridan. Through his
   drugged fog, Sheridan mumbles, "Michael! I was going to kick your butt
   for ... something. But I don't remember."
   
   Before waking Ivanova, Marcus looks at her soulfully and utters,
   "You'll never know." She curses when he tells her they're almost at
   the target and he didn't sleep. Before rushing to the bridge, Susan
   reminds him of the Minbari phrase he told her was a "greeting" the
   last time they were here. "You are the most beautiful woman I have
   ever known." She knows what it means now and thanks him.
   
   Trying to get past the guard post with Sheridan, the guards notice the
   blood on Garibaldi's back, and demand that the rescuers step away from
   the prisoner. They quickly shoot all the guards. Clumsily, Sheridan
   picks a gun off the floor and unloads it into one of the guards,
   shooting until the man is pulp. He looks at Garibaldi with very
   cognizant fury and insists he's fine.
   
   The White Star fleet emerges at the rendezvous point. A dozen jump
   points open on all sides and discharge a stream of destroyers. Ivanova
   is horrified when she sees them. Black skins and barbs on semi-organic
   hulls prove them to be based on Shadow technology. The force commands
   her to surrender, and when she refuses, demands to know who she is.
   
   "Who am I?" she asks. "I am Susan Ivanova. Commander. Daughter of
   Andre and Sophie Ivanov. I am the right hand of vengeance and the boot
   that is going to kick your sorry ass all the way back to Earth,
   sweetheart. I am death incarnate, and the last living thing that you
   are ever going to see. God sent me."
   
   With these words she opens fire and leads the fleet into the toughest
   battle they've faced yet. One by one White Stars drop, but they manage
   to outmaneuver and outgun the enemy until every one is destroyed. With
   her navigational controls damaged, White Star 2 is unable to avoid a
   huge mass of debris hurtling towards the ship. In the aftermath of the
   crash, Marcus picks himself up from the wreckage filling the bridge.
   He finds Ivanova's limp body and carries it away.
   
   Stumbling through the wide corridors of a Minbari cruiser, Sheridan
   suddenly stops and stares at the sight of Delenn. They embrace and he
   promises to talk about what happened to him later, but now he has to
   see Ivanova, who is being tended by Minbari doctors and Marcus. Her
   head is bolted into a vice-like stabilizer, her face is a mass of
   cotusions, and she is rarely conscious. She rouses when John comes and
   begs him to tell her the truth. Is she going to live? Painfully, he
   tells her, no. She only has about a week. And so she makes one final
   request.
   
   Sheridan steps onto the bridge of the Agamemnon. With the permission
   of her Captain, he announces that a friend has asked him to lead the
   final battle from here. At this, the multi-planet force sets out.
