I am retiring the Babylon 5 FAQ because it has been made obsolete by the
large number of other resources available on the World Wide Web.  There
isn't really a need for a FAQ anymore in today's WWW world.

Time-dependent information has been removed from this final version.
Files like this tend to get archived for a while, so I am publishing a
final version to stay in the various archives so it doesn't appear that
a new version is forthcoming.

For the latest information on Babylon 5, I direct you to:

http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/lurker.html
for the highly detailed "Lurker's Guide to Babylon 5."

These sites, or sites pointed to by these sites, should hold the information
you need to keep up on Babylon 5.

Subject: 1.  What is Babylon 5?

Babylon 5 is a science fiction television series, set in the mid 23rd Century,
which takes place on a five-mile-long space station, centrally located near
Earth and four other alien alliances.  The station was built as a kind of
United Nations, to help preserve peace in the galaxy;  Each of the alliances
has an official representative on the station.

Unlike most television series, an overall story arc has been planned for
Babylon 5 as if it were a miniseries or written novel.  Over the course of its
five-year run, events tell an overall story;  hints are dropped along the way
that foreshadow events to come.  However, each hour-long episode tells an
individual story and can be viewed alone. (As the show has progressed, many
episodes are less stand-alone than the earlier ones, however.)

The series is in its fifth season in North America, and is also airing
in many other countries, usually behind the US.  The show, originally
syndicated to individual stations across the U.S, is now airing on cable/
satellite network TNT, with new fifth-season episodes each week as well as
daily reruns.

A sequel series, to be called _The Babylon Project: Crusade_, has been
confirmed, and will begin production in July 1998 for a January 1999 premiere.

------------------------------

Subject: 2.  Where can I see Babylon 5?

Please see the Lurker's Guide for the latest information.

------------------------------

Subject: 3.  Who is behind Babylon 5? (i.e. Who the heck is JMS?)

The show was created by J. Michael Straczynski (JMS), who is co-executive
producer on the show along with Doug Netter.  It has been in development since
1987, and in production since 1992.  Doug Netter is an equal partner in
Babylon 5, mainly handling the business side and leaves the creative work to
Straczynski.  Harlan Ellison is the Conceptual Consultant for the series;  he
has also written a "manifesto" for the show that explains to other writers how
to write science fiction for television and Babylon 5, in particular.  Well-
known science fiction writers, including David Gerrold, D.C. Fontana, and
Peter David contributed scripts to some episodes, although JMS writes the bulk
of the scripts.  Christopher Franke, formerly of Tangerine Dream, does the
soundtrack.

------------------------------

Subject: 4.  What other SF projects has JMS been involved with?

JMS has been involved with genre television for many years, as story editor
and writer for the Twilight Zone TV series (syndicated version), Captain
Power, and the animated The Real Ghostbusters.  He has also written for 'Jake
and the Fatman' and 'Murder, She Wrote.' JMS has also had many published short
stories, an anthology, and two fantasy/horror novels.  Until recently, he was
co-host of Hour 25, a Los Angeles area science fiction radio talk show.  He
has also written a well-regarded book on scriptwriting.

------------------------------

Subject: 5.  What kind of Special Effects does Babylon 5 have?

All special effects for Babylon 5 are computer generated imagery (CGI).
For the first three seasons, the effects were done by Foundation Imaging,
headed by Ron Thornton, utilizing Lightwave 3D and specialized software to
design and render the visual effects.  (Lightwave is now running on PCs;
Amigas were used originally.)  Macintoshes and PCs are used occasionally
for 2-D effects and painting packages. Starting in season 4, the effects
are done in-house at Netter Digital, using similar equipment to Foundation's.

Subject: 8.  One-Liner FAQs

Following are some of the questions asked a lot by newcomers to Babylon 5 and
brief answers to those questions.

Production:

Q: Are the B5 novels and comics part of the official B5 canon?
A: Yes, JMS attempts to make sure the other stories tie into the big story.

Q: How come [insert name] is in the opening credits but not in the show?
A: Characters contracted for 7 or more episodes are in the opening credits.

Q: Which came first, Deep Space 9 or Babylon 5?
A: B5 was pitched to Paramount in 1989, two years before DS9 was created.

Q: What has happened with Harlan Ellison's scripts?
A: They've been delayed due to poor health and a full schedule.

Q: Is the "Be seeing you" salute a reference to "The Prisoner"?
A: Yes, most definitely.  It first appeard in season 1's "Mind War."

Q: Why don't we usually see stars revolving outside C&C?
A: CGI is too costly; They're still working on a reasonable solution.

Q: Who does the voice for the main B5 computer?
A: Haley McLane, Script Supervisor on the B5 production staff for seasons 1-3.

General:

Q: Why are they using paper in the 23rd century?
A: Paper is convenient.  It's actually a recyclable, synthetic material.

Q: Why was Sinclair, only a Commander, given the job of running the station?
A: The Minbari rejected all choices, down the line, until it reached Sinclair.

Q: What does the "Third Age" of mankind mean?  What are the 1st and 2nd?
A: This is not revealed until the first part of the fourth season.

Q: Why is the C&C (Command and Control) Dome sometimes empty?
A: It goes on "standby" every 36-48 hours for maintenance, backups, etc.

A: Yes.

Aliens:

Q: What's with the Centauri Hair?
A: Hair is a measure of status: more elaborate = higher status. Women go bald.

Q: Is Bill Mumy (Lennier) the same guy from _Lost In Space_?
A: Yes.  Only much older.

Q: How did the war between Earth and the Minbari start?
A: A misunderstanding on first contact.

Q: What race has the 'flying saucer' ships?
A: The Vree, a race that shows up from time to time; first in "Deathwalker."

Subject: 9. Miscellaneous Info

========    a. Babylon 5 online

Because JMS has been on GEnie talking about Babylon 5 since late 1991, GEnie
is a choice place to be for a Babylon 5 fan.  On the GEnie Science Fiction
RoundTable, there are two Babylon 5 categories where JMS talks with the fans
about the show, both production and story info.

Other Babylonians can be found online as well -- John Vulich and Mojo have
been spotted on Usenet; Mira Furlan lurks on GEnie; many writers such as David
Gerrold, Peter David, John Vornholt, and Christy Marx are on GEnie or CI$.

JMS is very active on the Usenet (since July 1993), although he stopped
participating when the flamebait quotient became intolerable.  He has rejoined
the Usenet fold with the creation of the moderated newsgroup.

JMS is also active on BIX, on CompuServe, and several other systems. (He also
"lurks" on a few systems to get a sense of how Babylon 5 discussions go
without his presence known.)

What JMS gets out of his participation online, is, as he puts it, a "sense of
the room."  Being a writer means coming up with questions to strengthen
characters and the world of the story, but nobody could ever come up with
every conceivable question. The nets are helpful because, as JMS puts it, "on
the nets, you get questions you never *dreamed* of."

One topic of discussion that arises frequently is the request that no story
ideas be suggested in the online forums.  This request is in place because if
somebody suggests a story, and it happens to be one that JMS is working on
already, that JMS is potentially open to lawsuits if the poster were to
suspect that her story idea were stolen.  For instance, JMS had to scrap a
story he was working on because somebody asked 'What if Joe wrote a story in
which a "memory-challenged" person DISCOVERED records of who he or she was?'
(This story was resurrected in the third season after some difficult legal
finageling....)

Often there are suggestions that the poster could include with their ideas a
"disclaimer" or a "release."  This has been debated over and over again, but
the issue boils down to the problem that no matter what, the B5 production
would be exposed to lawsuits, which, even if frivolous and unwinnable, would
shut down production of the show while in litigation.  Television producers in
general must go to great lengths to keep themselves protected, so JMS's
presence online hangs in a delicate balance.  If you do wish to suggest story
ideas, you can use the creative mailing list described in section 10a.

Online lore:  On usenet, a running joke is the Sinclair's "duck."  This
reference came about because of rude postings about male and female anatomy,
which became censored to words "T*TS" and "D*CK," which became "tots" and
"duck." There are also running gags about Zima and baseball bats.  Don't ask.
There's of course the <*> symbol that shows up in many fans' signatures since
the first season; it appears to represent a jumpgate, but its origin is lost
in obscurity.

========    b. Fans' influence on the show

The location of Babylon 5 is at Grid Epsilon 470,18,22 which corresponds to
the original location of the Babylon 5 topic on GEnie (Page 470, CAT 18, Topic
22).  The first mention of a planet's coordinates in "Mind War" were Grid
Epsilon 471,18,25 which corresponds to a topic in the Babylon 5 Category on
GEnie.

Partially due to fan response from those who saw the pilot movie or clips,
some things in the pilot movie were changed before broadcast.  The voice of
Delenn is Mira Furlan's voice without any processing and Delenn is female to
begin with.  Original plans were to electronically process her voice and have
Delenn change sex during the series. Some additional voice-over was done by
Patricia Tallman to clarify one scene in the show with Kosh in the Medlab.

The branding of a Minbari in "The War Prayer" that had similarities to a DS9
episode was kept after feedback from fans about it.  It had been considered
removing the branding scene and electronically wiping the brand from the rest
of the episode.

In the first season, when names submitted for a mega corporation and a mineral
were rejected for legal reasons, JMS went to the GEnie B5 Category and asked
for suggestions. The resulting names used are Quantium-40 for the mineral
(submitted by David Strauss) and Universal Terraform for the company (submit-
ted by Arne Starr), and were used in "Parliament of Dreams" and "Mind War."
Perhaps not coincidentally, the waiter in one of the episodes is named David.

The denizens of "Downbelow" are called "lurkers," a term for those on the
newsgroups who read messages but never post.

Based on interest in the legal aspects of the Psi Corps, he indicates how
some of this works in "The Quality of Mercy."

An EA ship in "A Voice in the Wilderness" is named "Hyperion" in
acknowledgment of the original name of the Babylon 5 archive site and home of
the Lurker's Guide, formerly ftp.hyperion.com.

The lightbulb joke in "Convictions" is an homage to the net presence of
B5 and the various jokes that people post.  A reference to Sheridan's "true
face" as being mashed by his pillow came out of Usenet discussion.

See the Lurker's Guide for more recent information.

========    d. Babylon 5 References in other JMS works

In the Captain Power episode "Final Stand," Tank mentions that he's from the
Babylon 5 Genetic Engineering Colony.

In the JMS Novel "Othersyde," Babylon 5 is mentioned as one of the characters'
favorite TV series.

In the Captain Power Episode "A Summoning of Thunder Part 2", when Hawk
activates the first power suit, Mentor says "And So It Begins".  This has
been confirmed by JMS as a "Koshism" he threw in.

========    e. Miscellaneous Production Info

Babylon 5 is being filmed in the 16:9 aspect ratio, trimming it for broadcast.
Plans are for the episodes to later be available in widescreen on laserdisc
and when HDTV happens.  The opening titles are in letterbox format.

Audio is being done in full Surround Sound.  Larry DiTillio wrote
background dialogue (known as "walla") in the first two seasons.

Alien makeup and such for the series is being done by Optic Nerve Studios
(Everett Burrell and John Vulich) which is a change from the pilot.

The early episodes had some video and audio degradation due to the manner in
which commercials, closed captioning and such were being added using analog
transfers and used tape.  Some was corrected by the broadcast of "The War
Prayer" with more improvements in time.

Several "errors" have been broadcast and then later fixed.  The original
"Mind War" had a CGI error (you could see a bright star through a ship in
the first scene) that was corrected for later broadcasts.  The original North
America satellite feed of "Chrysalis" was incorrectly assembled; some markets
broadcast this version.  An incorrect historical reference to Jack the Ripper
from "Comes the Inquisitor" was replaced.  In "Moments of Transition", an EA
Cruiser was mistakenly labelled the Agamemnon, and will be replaced.  It is
anticipated that footage of Anna Sheridan featuring Beth Toussant was
replaced with Melissa Gilbert footage to improve continuity. (VERIFICATION?)

========    f. Production Order vs. Airing Order

Several episodes were aired in a different order than they were originally
produced.  One reason is to allow extra time for post-production of a
particularly effects-laden episode.  In a few cases, episodes were aired in
a slightly different order from their original production order; for details,
see WWW: http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/countries/master/

The fourth season finale was as production number 501, along with the fifth
season episodes.  This is because the series finale had already been filmed,
and once B5 was given its fifth season, the episode was held until the end of
the fifth season.

TNT has assured fans that the episodes, when aired on TNT, will be aired in
an official order as determined by JMS.

========    g. Production Changes

----> Between pilot and first season:

Due to reworking and recasting after the pilot, Lt. Cmdr. Laurel Takashima,
Dr. Benjamin Kyle, and telepath Lyta Alexander were replaced.  Kyle and
Alexander were sent back to Earth under "mysterious circumstances"; Takashima
is on a classified mission, and may return someday.  Much of the character
stories and back-histories were transferred to their replacements.

Make-up for G'Kar was improved; Delenn's look was substantially modified once
it was established that the character would be female.

----> Between first and second season:

Director Richard Compton, a fixture on B5 at its inception, left the show
after "Grail."  The narration and main titles was changed to be shorter, and
to include new graphics introducing the characters.  Many improvements in
costumes, makeup, lighting, and FX were added for season 2. Several new sets
were added, including a bazaar and an officer's lounge called "Earhart's,"
after the famed aviator. In order to advance the story, the character of
Commander Sinclair was moved "off the chess board" at the start of season 2.
According to JMS, this was a mutual, amicable decision between producers and
Michael O'Hare.  Lt. Cmdr. Ivanova was promoted to Commander; Delenn went
through a physical change.  Na'Toth was re-cast, and the character of Warren
Keffer was added.

----> Between second and third season:

The narration changed once again.  Additional sets were brought on, including
a rather large one.  Keffer and Talia Winters, and Na'Toth are no longer on
the show; Zack Allan was made a regular character, and Marcus Cole was brought
in as a regular.

----> Between third and fourth season:

Foundation Imaging is no longer doing the visual effects; they are now done in
house by Netter Digital.  Additionally, many of the behind-the-scenes crew
that had been on the show since the beginning are not returning.  Lyta
Alexander joins the main cast of the show.

----> Between fourth and fifth season:

Claudia Christian leaves the cast; Tracy Scoggins joins the cast.

----> A list of episodes that have been mentioned online and later retitled.

  "Blood and Thunder"       -->  "Midnight on the Firing Line"
  "Amaranth"                -->  "Born to the Purple"
  "Carnival!"               -->  "The Parliament of Dreams"
  "A Knife in the Shadows"  -->  "Survivors"
  "Backlash"                -->  "By Any Means Necessary"
  "Raiding Party"           -->  "Signs and Portents"
  "The Resurrectionist"     -->  "The Quality of Mercy"
  "Chrysalis, Part II"      -->  "Points of Departure"
  "A Trick of the Mind"     -->  "A Spider in the Web"
  "Pestilence, Famine & Death">  "Soul Mates"
  "Cat and Mouse"           -->  "A Tragedy of Telepaths"

  Season 3 was initially called "I am Death, Destroyer of Worlds."

> Scripts not used in Season 1:

  "Target Unknown" and "Metaphors and Body Counts" (David Gerrold)

> Harlan Ellison stories mentioned but not written: "Midnight in the Sunken
  Cathedral" and "Demon on the Run"

> Season 2 story titles shelved:

  All Our Songs Forgotten, a.k.a. "Unnatural Selection" (D.C. Fontana),
  The Very Long Night of Susan Ivanova (JMS), "Expectations" (David Gerold)
