Bester, and that it's not out of the realm of possibility for Bester to find
some way to defeat the drug.  If not, then his line was basically another way

war within ourselves as much as it is Out There.  So Nightwatch, the
political situation back home, are shadow wars of their own.

it was also a courtesy.  (Later on, while shooting "A Late Delivery From

From:  Jms at B5       

Just one thing to bear in mind in all this, referring to ST bashing...you
don't have a situation here of B5 fans "bashing" ST.  What you tend to have
are ST fans who've *always* had some concerns with the shows expressing their
concerns here, because they also watch B5, and because to express some of
this in other forums gets them yelled at.

While there are many ST fans who have not seen B5, there are no B5 fans who
have not seen ST.  What you have here is an internal ST situation, not a case
of B5 fans hitting a show they don't know about or watch.  I'd venture to
suggest that most of the concerns voiced here are ones they had long, long
before there WAS a B5.

That said, I've noted from the beginning that there was no reason to hold the
shows up side by side; they're different series, and that just puts ST at the
center of the fictional universe.  Let this show be its own creature.

At the moment, that's not my choice, you need a big studio backing you for a
big movie.  Also, B5 was primarily *designed* for TV, this is the venue I'd
prefer to work in for this.  You'd have to do 55 movies to tell the whole

Subj:  B5 Ratings Info
Date:  96-02-18 01:00:52 EST
From:  Jms at B5       

The figures have come in for our first non-rerun episode, "Voices of
Authority."  The numbers of any show always drop in reruns; something that
some folks tend to avoid mentioning when they just post figures without
noting these things.  But moving on....

While KUNG FU, in its new episode, went from #50 to #61 for the week in
syndicated shows (this is out of 257 syndicated shows total, btw), B5 surged
from #54 to #41, with a 3.5 rating, well above that which is guaranteed to
advertisers.  

(DS9 continues to wobble; #16 last week, and #15 this week; they haven't been
in the top ten for a while now.  This in reply to some who asked for a
relative positioning.)

At #41 out of 257 shows, B5 is in the top 1/6th of all syndicated shows
overall, about the top 16% or thereabouts.  In terms of drama shows, B5 is in
the top 10 of all drama shows for that period, at #8.  

So far, so good.

Date:  96-02-18 19:10:32 EST
From:  Jms at B5       

"...without Star Trek there probably wouldn't be a Babylon 5...."

This is one of the biggest misperceptions we've had to try and correct over
time; if anything, ST has been an obstacle to getting B5 on the air.  The #1
reason we were given, time and again, during the 5 years it took to sell B5
for not going ahead with it, was that "There isn't room in the marketplace
for another space show other than ST.  There's not an SF marketplace; there's
a ST marketplace, but that's all.  ST doesn't create more SF, ST creates more
ST."

Right up until the day we aired the pilot, some folks at WB were saying,
"This isn't gonna work, there's not enough room in the market for another SF
space show other than Star Trek."  And suffice to say that Paramount didn't
make things any easier for us in their inimitable fashion.

If the premise as advanced in the first line were true, then why in the 30
years since ST:TOS has there not another space-SF series that's lasted more
than three seasons?  Why have there been so very few shows even TRYING this
venue?  In those 30 years, with the exception of Quantum Leap, which was more
an anthology show really, no hardcore SF series has gone beyond 3 years; that
alone mitigates against SF being a viable market.

Trust me on this; for the five years it took us to sell B5, ST was one more
obstacle to overcome.  It's not their fault, it's the fault of the
marketplace that doesn't understand SF.  It's unfortunate that, when a cop
show fails, industry folks just say, "Well, that show didn't work," but when
an SF series fails, they say, "There's no market for SF."

1) There was an outsider, Kirkish, in the room.  Yes, she's helped him, but
he's still going to hold back some info because he doesn't know what impact
it might have on Sinclair.  He's protective of him.

2) Yes, Kosh should've been there.  Kosh wasn't.  Kosh hasn't been carrying
his weight, if you ask me.  I hope this doesn't cause a problem somewhere....

{2) With six appendages for the males and six slots for the females, I kinda
wonder if the Centauri are capable of multiple births on a regular basis.
Care to comment on that?}

No multiple births, in that sense, not any different than humans.

{1) Although the capital of the Earth Alliance (Earthdome) is located in
Geneva, it seems to me the basic legislative structure is like the United
States, albeit in a unicameral setting (I see only the Senate). Did you plan
it this way, and have you ever thought about doing a historical
article/presentation on Earth history until the Babylon 5 setting?}

Your analysis on the governmental situation is pretty accurate; the Senate in
this case comprised of member nation/states, with smaller ones having less
voice than the bigger ones (like the Russian Consortium, the North American
Federation, and so on).

{You could create a file entitled, "NO JMS Allowed". That should cover the
legal stuff}

1) Simply saying "NO JMS" on a folder is not sufficient; I could still go
into any area to which I have been proven to have access.  Having access to
the general area (AOL) access to the specific material is *automatically
assumed* in any court of law.  Instant loss should someone post a story and
decide later that something we did was too close to their story.

2) I have asked, as a courtesy, for people to refrain from fan fiction until
the 5 year story is over.  There are only 2 years remaining on this request.
ST fanfic was developed as a way to keep the characters alive while the show
was gone.  There is no such need at this time.

3) If fanfic is posted to AOL, I will have to withdraw from AOL.  That
simple.  It's even worse than posting a story idea, it's a whole *story*.  I
have no desire to scuttle another story, or a major part of an arc, to avoid
somebody thinking I swiped it.

4) Be advised that the names, situations and characters are all copyrighted
by Warner Bros., and if courtesy is not sufficient, any infringement of that
copyright by fanfiction will be conveyed to the legal eagles for action.

Don't do it.  I *mean* it.

Guide staffers, as I understand it.

2) Is there a timeline that lists the approximate day/month/year that each
episode takes place?  If so, could you post it?

I don't have one available outside the show, since it's very detailed and
has, well, EVERYthing in it, past and future...but there's one at the
hyperion website (available here via the www jumpgate) that's pretty darned
thorough.

3) You say that after B5 ends, there is a possible "spin off" that _could_

either a novel or a series of novels?

From:  Jms at B5       

Cristine: thanks.  You're right, in many ways it is personal to me.  I tend
to get passionate about the job because I never taken on any job unless I
feel passionately about it, if that makes any syntactical sense whatsoever.
Life's too short.  B5 is a particular case in that this is something that
everyone involved -- from the cast, through to the crew, directors, others --
is absolutely dedicated to.  They believe that we're creating something
rather extraordinary here, something that'll be talked about for a long time
after we're gone.  

It took me five years to sell this show, after everyone else told me to
forget it, that it'd never happen, that it was too ambitious...said that I
*could* sell it if I made it sexier, less aimed at the "smart" viewers and
more accessible to folks who just want plain action and a smattering of sex.
I could've sold a more mainstream series with far less hassle, to any of the
networks.  But I have to tell *this* story.  

So when you're obsessed with something, it's easier to spend 24.9 hours a day
working on it.  (I cobble up the extra 9/10ths of an hour from a
fourth-dimensional gate in my office.)  As for the online time...that ties
into the obsession part, in some ways, but beyond that, it's a chance to keep
working at my #1 bugaboo, demystifying TV, being responsive (and answerable)
to fans when it works or doesn't work...actually, it works out for me because
when I have to stop writing and think through a story point, I don't just get
up and walk into the living room to watch TV, where you can lose a couple
hours at a time.  I stay at the keyboard, do a quick pass through one of the
nets, kill 15 minutes...by which time I've worked out the story point, and I
get back to work.  It keeps me at the computer.

But yeah...in every conceivable sense, the work comes first in my life. This
is the single biggest thing I've ever attempted in my life, in terms of sheer
scale and scope and hours.  It has a finite lifespan.  So during that time,
it owns me.  I can give it nothing less.  When it's finally done, then I can
rest.  Selling and running the show is like being yoked to a train; you pull
real hard for a long time, for five years, until it finally moves.  Then it
picks up speed.  And then you spend the next five years of your life running
as fast as you can in front of it, because if you slow down, it'll run over
you.

Subj:  Re:nightwatch
Date:  96-02-28 04:29:16 EST
From:  Jms at B5       

Here's something to consider in this.

It's easy -- safe and reassuring -- to dismiss Nightwatch and the whole
political climate on Earth at this time as referring to Nazi germany...SS,
Stormtroopers, informers...but if we know our history, it shows that this is
not so isolated as we might think.  If we say it was just the Nazis, then
it's a non-repeatable phenomenon, we needn't worry about it again.

But, of course, it does happen again...it did, and it will, to varying
degrees.  Go back to the Inquisition, and forward to Joe McCarthy and the
House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) which destroyed lives and
reputations based on association, past history, social contacts and party
affiliations (the items specified by Musante to the EA folks in Nightwatch).
Stalin and to a lesser extent Lenin would have been right at home in
Nightwatch.  Several of the leaders speaking for parties in the ruins of what
was once Yugoslavia would also fit.  

It's easy, and safe, for us to say, "Oh, we would never do that, only THEY
did that."  But the "they" in this ARE the we on the other side...and "we"
have done it, are doing it now, and will continue to do it.  Only when we
*know* the history of such things, when we recognize the rhetoric of control,
when we oppose blacklisting and scapegoating and dead-catting do we help to
assure that they *won't* arise again.  Remember the quote: "Those who do not
remember history are condemned to repeat it."

There's a great deal of generalized historical and political metaphor in the
show, never one-to-one because that's too easy, but disguised in one form or
another, transumted.  The Centauri Republic isn't a real republic by any
stretch of the imagination...any more than the Roman Republic from which it
draws some of its political structure, particularly the Centarum, the ruling
body.  There's a great deal of Japanese political and social structure to the
Minbari, in their culture and art and some of their philosophy.  You can find
parallels to the story in World War II, and the bible, among a few dozen
others.

Too little of TV these days is *about* anything...it's all context, no
subtext.  This show is about a lot of things...but never in the mode of
telling you what to think.  We'll ask *that* you think, that you consider the
world around you, and your place in it...but defining that is your business,
not ours.

A very good point.  Zack is, to all intents and purposes, the Everyman

exactly *know* what's right, because he's getting conflicting

When a culture become factionalized, when it becomes us vs. them, everyone
starts setting up consistently smaller camps...first it's democrats vs.
republicans...then it's mainstream republicans vs. conservative
republicans...then it's conservative republicans vs. religious right
