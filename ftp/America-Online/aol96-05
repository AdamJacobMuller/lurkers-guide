The story kind of came in all at once; and yes, in a way, it's the story I've
been preparing to write from day one.  The eclectic, weird background I have
is what enables me to tell this story this way.  This is, I think, my seminal
work in the field.  To invoke greater names for a moment, Heinlein wrote lots
of books, but he's known for Stranger in a Strange Land; Frank Herbert wrote
lots of books, but he's known for Dune.  I've done a lot before this, and
hope to do a lot after, but I suspect that this is what I'll be most known
for when it's all said and done.

"I'm assuming when you are the creator/writer/executive producer of a running
series that you must spend an enormous amount of time either "doing" things
related to it or "thinking" about things related to it."

Absolutely.  Even when I'm not actively working on it, it comes up constantly
in conversation, or in other ways.  It never goes away, and I'm always
jotting down notes for future use.

"How does this affect your lifestyle?  Can one be in your position and still
have a personal life - or is literally everything you do somehow involved
with, wrapped up in or connected to "the series"?"

Not if you're going to be this involved with the process.  It's really a 24
hour a day job.  I haven't seen a movie at a theater in the 8 months
preceding the wrap; haven't gone to a party except the B5 christmas and wrap
parties in about a year.  For the six years it'll take to make this show --
you count the pilot and post-production on the last year -- I went into this
knowing that my personal life would pretty much go to hell for that period of
time.  The show is the single dominant concern; has to be, or it won't be
done right.  

"Are you able to go out and have a good time and not think about anything to
do with B5, or is it always there, in the back of your mind?"

It's always there.

"I very much admire what you do, but feel it must, at some point, drive you a
little nuts........"

Sometimes, but only a little.  I fought for 5 years to get this show on the
air; it's a great privilege, and a terrible responsibility; WB has entrusted
me to do this properly, and that's a great compliment.  In the media, it's
unspeakably rare to get one singular vision on the air, without compromise or
committee...I'm not *about* to complain about the hours.  I've got absolutely
no grounds to complain about ANYthing.

gun in act 3, you must show it in act one.  I do try to play fair with the

that if you back up all the episodes, it's right there in front of you.

No scripts are in hand for next season, in any form; this is always the case
each year as we wrap production.  We wait for WB to renew the show, then
provide a script order.  Once we have the script order in hand, scripts get
going.  If it's a freelance script, going from first meeting through 2 drafts
of the outline, 2 drafts of the script, it takes about a month, plus the time
I spend revising it; if I write it myself, it's a lot less time, because I
know the show more than any freelancer can be reasonably expected to.

If I can make a suggestion....

Please try to avoid packing a message with 5, 7 or 10 questions or more; the
odds are that I won't be able to answer all of them, or even most of them.
The problem with the AOL interface is that if I use the Read New command,
once it pops up, if I log off the point where I came in is lost.  If I take a
long time to answer 7 questions in one message, the odds are good that I'll
either get bumped or have to go do B5 stuff and won't get to the other
messages/questions, and it's hard to backtrack afterward.  It's also a bit
more than I find manageable, given that when you combine all the services I'm
on, about 500 messages per day flit in front of my corneas.

So if we could keep the questions down to just a couple per message, it'd
help me a lot.

"1.  In the unthinkable, will you wrap up the storyline this season, or is

After the conclusion of this season, there are basically 3 major movements
remaining in the symphony (for lack of a better description).  They fit
comfortably in 2 seasons, leaving room to do the usual routine of starting
each season with 4-5 standalones, and layering in other standalones along the
way, some non-arc personal stories, and so on.

If they came to me, put a gun to my head and said, "Okay, year four is it,
wrap it up," yes, it could be done.  You just yank out the standalones and
interstitial stuff I put between major movements, and shove the three pieces
together.  It's not what I'd *prefer*, obviously, but it could be done.

double meanings when they're *not* there.  Art is a participatory sport.

Vorlon/Shadow tech is more or less at the same level; the Vorlons had the

"In WWE(1)I noticed a larger than usual group of offhand lines (ethel
&.../wait in car.../cool-you know what I'm talking about).  Was this
scripted?  Or was someone just ad libbing?"

There's almost NO ad-libbing allowed on the show.  You can't change a word
unless someone comes to my office and approves it, and it can't change the
meaning.  (I.e., the actor is having a hard time saying "shibboleth" or
something.)  Everything said in this show is scripted, offhand comments
included.

don't often get credited under SAG rules.

Stuff will start going out soon.  For one thing, we're getting a crush of
memberships, and rather than keep sending out dribs and drabs, we're trying
to do stuff all at once to make it simpler for mailing, copying, printing and
the like.  The first newsletter is finished, and should be going out shortly,
and the poster is being somewhat redesigned 'cause I wasn't quite happy with
what we had, it could be improved, and that's what we're doing.

We've contacted Howard's people, who say that because he likes the show so
much, he doesn't want the folks to do his show because he'd have to rag on
them by virtue of the nature of the show, and doesn't really want to do that.

"Would YOU categorize Babylon 5 as a Science Fiction show, or a Drama?  I
know that it is set in a Science Fiction setting, but the storylines and such
are really, I think, in the Drama category.  What do you think?"

I have no problem calling it a science fiction, or SF (which also includes
speculative fiction) show.  I know a number of writers in TV who hate the
term, deny that what they're doing is SF, but I'm proud that it's SF, and
would definitely classify it as such.

Thanks.  Actually, I keep hearing about B5 screenings becoming social events
on an ever more regular basis.  Sometimes to "convert," sometimes to catch
'em off satellite, or just watch them on a big screen.  I think it's great.

Thanks again.

It'd be hard to work in what everybody else saw in an episode down the

Thanks, and I remain happy to be here.

On the writing and the scenes you cite...a story, *any* story, should be
designed not just to take you through the mechanics of a plot, but to make
you *feel* something.  Those, for me, are the elements I look for when I
watch something, and when I write something.  If I'm not on the verge or
tears in writing Kosh's fate, you won't be that way watching it.
