I suggest you see what we actually DO with the show, and that relationship,
before making either conclusions or threats or overall statements.

In general, I work out the elements of each race that tends to distinguish it
from the others as an overall unit (in which there can be some variation, I
don't believe in totally monolithic, all-the-same races), and play those
throughout; I also create the aspects of each individual character within
that as a subset.  Whe I write, I just have that info in the background, and
let the characters take me with them.

Yeah, it was a sneaky way of having a first kiss and *not* having a first
kiss, all at the same time.

We plan to bring at least one other woman character in as a recurring
character next season, and do more with the female characters we already
have.

...and taking care of some of the backlog, as best I can.  It's a lot to
catch up on.  Things just got nuts, as they will do on a show like this.
Address any other notes to the #9 ask jms section, as this one's about to
fill up, I think.  Sorry for the absence...

This is one of those questions that's kind of like asking the magician to
tell you where that rabbit REALLY came from...and to look at the alternate
universe possibiliities of the story, and I'm just barely adequate to keep
THIS story going without looking at all the permutations, which would just
make me get confused and fall down....

"I just heard a Rumour from one fan; he mentioned that **you** were
interested in continuing development of Space: Above and Beyond on the WB
Network (Fox just cancelled it), and that you were going to tie in the Chigs
with one of the secondary races of B5...in an "alternate" fashion."

Funniest thing I've heard all day.....

"As a cure for the creative souls among us, may I humbly offer the following
suggestion: create a new folder strictly for B5 Fan Fiction"

Absolutely positively no way.  

Yes, the B5 storyline is set.  Could we win any case in court?  Yes.  Do I
want to spend three years of my life or thereabouts giving depositions,
talking to lawyers, and spending hundreds of thousands of dollars and the
aggravation involved in all this?  No.  Not because somebody wants to toss
out a story idea and later decide he wants to sue.  

No fan fiction, no story ideas.  Or I'm outta here.  That's tough to say, and
to hear, but that's the only request I make in exchange for being here.

No, we consult with and give direction to all B5 licensees.  And the RPG is
coming out from Wireframe/Chameleon.

Dell just picked up the license to produce 3 more books, so they should be
out probably by the end of the year or so.
