I strongly suggest you try this week's episode, "Severed Dreams."  I showed
it at a small con/fan gathering here in LA on Saturday, before the uplink,
and there were several folks there who hadn't seen or been moved to check out
B5...and by the time it was over, they'd turned around.

No, the Triluminaries are simply not that important.  This isn't a story
about a mcguffin, a thing that has to be acquired or protected or regained;
also isn't a quest story.  If you look at any work of an epic, mythic or
saga-based construction, certain elements are universal.  Those themes show
up in all such sagas...if you look for any kind of real story correlation
between B5 and LoTR you won't find them.  They're not in any way parallels.

No, I don't believe so.  You've seen a jump GATE used, but that's different
from a jump POINT which basically closes right behind the ship like a rabbit
pulling its hole in after it.  If the ships stayed behind to protect its
rear, they'd be left behind.  Ships coming out of a jump point into normal

"I would round up all the destroyed EA/centauri/narin hulls/ships I could
find.(Especially the burned out Agrippa) to intimidate others who come with
hostile intent.  Also it would serve as a parts depot."

What's there are burned, blackened husks, which you do NOT want floating
around as they become hideous dangers to navigation, and the "spare parts"
would eventually start banging into your station, hitting incoming ships and
starfuries.  What can be salvaged, has been.

"I would construtively use my communication command athourity to send letters
to the families of the dead."

EA has cut off access to Earth; they don't want Sheridan getting information
from back home, or relaying instructions to forces there.

"I would rig the jump gate to explode on my command."

Good idea; cut off the only means of escape for the quarter million people
there who don't have jump capable ships.  You won't stop an invasion by
hostile ships which can make their own jump points, you just end up killing
all your civilians.

"Make a deal with Drall on the defences, and learn of all his capabilities
also the Minbari's."

This is already in process, as has been established.

"Arrange an accident to happen to one of the shadow creatures on board and
get it to Dr. Franklin or Drall."

You have to find them first.

"Start a propagada campaign against Clark."

Better to tell the truth.  And, again, home-communications are down.

"Unite the renegade ships and offer a home to the missing Narin ship."

This is an obvious step already in process.

"Have the Minbari make a clone of Morden."

They don't have that technology.

"Start a spy network."

They're doing all they can to get info.

"Start propaganda working the non-aligned worlds."

See above.

"Get some answers from Kosh or kill him(information is everything)."

Yessir, that'll work out great.  The vorlons are important to winning this;
let's torture or kill their ambassador, REAL good idea.

"Have Lyta scan all the crew members for spyes and loyalties."

When you become obsessed with the enemy, you become the enemy.  This would be
a Bad Thing.

"Move the minbari ships out of sight(behind the planet)."

Another good idea; let's put them where they have to come all the way around
the planet, by which time B5 is a burned cinder.

"Start gathering intelegence on the shadows ships.  How many, were are they
made, how long to make"

Where would you get that information?  The only real source is on Z'ha'dum.

Basically, everything that can be done, *is* being done.  But people have to
have some moments to live, or there's nothing worth fighting for.  And
sometimes a relationship can remind us what we're fighting for.

The cold, hard and rather ruthless answer is...if you're not sure, if it's
just something you're kinda thinking about...don't do it.

The only ones who have a chance of making it as writers are those who can't
*not* write.  

"I am trying to find out what I can do with my life and writing sound like
fun."  It's not fun, as you mean it.  It's agony.  It's the hardest thing I
do.  It takes *years* of work, every single day, day in and day out, before
you get any good at it at all.  It takes suffering and pain and paying your
dues and fighting every single day first to prove you have talen to yourself,
then to prove it to others, then to finally begin making a living at it.
It's not a case of, "Well, look over there, *that* looks interesting, maybe
I'll do that."

Either being a writer means everything to you, or it doesn't.  If it doesn't,
you shouldn't do it.  It's not a question of knowing "what you want to do."
You *know* it.  It's just a matter of the will and strength required to *do*
it.

Unless that describes you...try something else.

Basically, the Marines burned through the outer hull, moved into the inner
hull (like any good vessel, this one is double hulled), then came up at a
right angle, looking for a good wall to come through.  You *don't* want to
come up through the floor, because then you have to climb out one or two at a

The other thing to bear in mind about all this is the question of a "clean
fight."  If Sheridan were to bring in alien forces at his order to kill
humans, it would pretty much destroy his credibility.  Delenn came in at the
end but only after he'd made his stand on his own.  

One of the things that kicked off the French Revolution was the allegation
that the King had brought in or was bringing in Prussian troops to help put
down dissenters.  As long as it was all more or less in the family, that was
one thing...but to bring in outsiders was an absolute affront to them.  (One
of the singular incidents that started the fighting itself was a group of
Prussian soldiers sighted sitting in a cafe having lunch, which caused this
rumor about outsiders coming in to spread like wildfire, and led to the some
of the first major incidents of rioting.)

Two brothers may fight one another, but let a third unrelated person come in
and shove one of the brothers around, and they'll *both* turn on him.

During the worst days of the civil war, even Lincoln was offered assistance
in troops from at least one other country; he declined, because it was an
internal matter, and had to be resolved by those involved, not outsiders.

Sheridan's logic was exactly the same.  It had to be a clean fight.

I wanted to do a saga; sagas take time to tell.  The Lensman books, the
Foundation books, Dune, others...they can take from a few years to hundreds
of years to tell.  (I love "A Canticle for Liebowitz," which compresses an
amazing timeline into one volume.)  Doing decades worth of story would be
impossible for TV's format, but a one-to-one year-to-season structure was
do-able.

You need to have a dictionary around, which is what was used.  

The comparison, I suppose, would be those who say that Jorge Luis Borges'
work can only be most truly appreciated in the original Spanish.  There's a
*translated* version, which someone has gone through and made the translation
for you, written it all out in English...or you can learn the language, and
then read the original manuscript.
