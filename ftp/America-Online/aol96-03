How do you like your crow?  Medium?  Well-done?  It can't be rare because
crows are hardly ever rare.

What's coming up?  Hmmm...the world is turned upside down, other people turn
their backs on everything they think they believe in, a voice comes from the
distant past, there's a change in fashion sense, there's romance (intended

revolutions, treaties and a whole lotta gunfire.

universities, crisis centers, you name it.  Something there seemed to strike
a chord.

It's easy in an SF show to cut to the EFX and let it rock; to me, the
challenge is what's shown in those scenes: two people, locked in a room, no
(or few) EFX, no car chases, not even much of a set...with explosions of
dialogue and character.  Ah loves it.

Allow me to disagree with you.  Re: "The Nine Billion Names of God," the
whole purpose of that story had nothing to do with alien contact; it had to
do with gettting all the earthbound names of God into a computer, so they
could create the end of the world.  The monks are on B5 in an attempt at
studying the different religions out there for the purpose of better
understanding...or more succinctly, comparitive religious studies, which long
predate Clarke by, oh, about 500 years.

second-runs in most markets.  It wasn't a problem the first two years, but
now with so much new syndicated product on the market, the logical and
understandable reaction is, "Why should I rerun an episode of one show when I
can put on a *new* episode of *another* show and make *more money*?"  But the
advertising is sold based on double-runs in some cases, or at least a certain
percentage of double runs.  So we'll have to see.  I am, for now, cautiously

I've always been a writer.  Even when I was just a kid, I was "preparing,"
always checking out different kinds of writing instruments, collecting the
artifacts of writing...took 3 years of typing in high school until I got to
120 wpm...but I didn't start writing until mid-high school, when I finally
decided I had read enough, thought enough about it, and was *ready*.  

That day, I started writing finally.  I wrote a story I placed with the
school magazine done out of one of the writing classes.  The next thing I
wrote ended up in a small outside magazine.  Then I began writing and placing
articles and plays and stories....

I took some writing classes in college, but the only ones of value were the
workshops, not the ones where you're taught to write the way the teacher
*wants* you to write.  The whole theory of writing is to find your unique
voice; if you surrender that by writing the way somebody else writes, you've
sacrificed the only commodity you had to offer: your unique vision of the
world.  In any event, as stated, I was writing and selling long before I took
my first writing class.

Since 1971, I have written 5-10 pages per day (the last 12+ years generally
10 or better) every day of the week, 52 weeks a year, except for my birthday,
christmas, new year's, and my spouse's birthday.  On my first trip to
England, I swore I wouldn't write, I'd take some time off; I ended up
sneak-buying a small notepad and, by the time I got back, had outlined my
first novel, later published by Dutton.

I've written over 500 published articles, dozens of published short stories,
12 produced plays, a number of songs recorded here and there (including two
for a prime time ABC special), 2 published novels, 1 published anthology, a
number of screenplays (some made as TV stuff, some not produced), and 145+
produced TV scripts, among other stuff.

I write all the time.  It's not what I do, it's what I *am*.

you hear it a different way, and you have to adjust.  Sometimes the actor
sounds just like what you had in mind (as with Jason Carter and Claudia).  

For me, what's interesting is when an actor finds something in the text that
was there, that I didn't recognize even though I'd written it, and
illuminates a corner of the character.  (And sometimes I discover I've
revealed more about myself than I'd intended in a scene, only finding this
out when I see the actor saying the words.)  

Probably the biggest impact in B5 terms was in seeing the humor that Claudia
could bring to the part, and the vulnerability that Peter summoned up.  The
scene in the pilot movie where Londo goes to Garibaldi and says, basically,
yes, I messed up, and yes, I'd do it again, showed a great depth of feeling,
of conflicting emotions that lifted that scene way beyond what was on the
page, and showed me that I could take Londo anywhere I wanted, and the actor
behind the character could and would take it all the way without ever
stumbling.

think about, I flip over to writing a short story, a novel, an article,
something else.  Also, I never sit down to write out a scene or a section

Err...I hate to correct you, but Nightwatch members do NOT have black
uniforms.  Many of them wear armbands, but others do not.  Julie Musante did
not wear an armband.  Neither did the snitch in C&C who turned in the Narn
cruiser in "Fall."  B5 security members were given the arm bands as part of
their uniform, indicating that they were serving Nightwatch in an official
capacity, the same as you'd give a badge or ID to someone working for two
agencies.  There are and can be others who are part of Nightwatch who don't
wear the arm bands.

Also, it's not "an heraldic."  It's A heraldic.  You only use AN if you can't
hear the H sound; if you can, then you use A.  As in "An hour" and "A horse."
Similarly, the use "an historic" is also incorrect.

So when someone asks, "who creates the character?" one can say the writer

Oddly enough, Jerry's broken arm tied *beautifully* into something that had

line or two to sell it.

The funny thing is...in the very next episode after the incident, there was a
line in the script I'd written *weeks* earlier, and it freaked everybody
out...when Garibaldi asks someone to do something, and the person responds,
"What, you've got a broken arm or something?"  At first some people thought
I'd put it in there to pink Jerry, but it'd been there the whole time.  

Similarly, in the Claudia incident, there was a line (cut for time) where
Sheridan says talking to the Drazi is like trying to talk to your right
foot...and Ivanova replies "I'll have you know I have a sublime relationship
with my right foot."  Yep, the next day...that's the foot she broke.

Just recently, I was trying to explain time travel to one of the actors.  I
used the analogy, over lunch, "Suppose you finished eating your chicken here,
then got sick as a dog a few hours later, then got in a time machine to go

Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, which has some very serious
commentary on what *is* patriotism, what what *is* the Nation?

Uncritical jingoism is as inherently unpatriotic as uncritical attacks.  It's
important to see what a goverment does that is good, by our ability to
perceive the good, and support it...and to find what is in need of redress,
and fix it.  But either way, we have to be honest about what we see, and ask
ourselves if it's right.  Even if we come back toward saying yes, it *is*
right, at least we've thought about it, and now have reasons and objective

I'm involved in the comics and novels, but the problem with the novels is
that I get only a few days to review the manuscript before it has to go back,
and given everything else I'm doing, sometimes I miss things.  I try to keep
it as close to the show as I can, but there are always going to be glitches
when you let it out of your direct supervision and into the hands of others.

Sometimes things slip through; the on-screen writing was done at Foundation,
since we don't have that capability, and they did it left to right.  I wasn't
able to be on set at the moment we shot that to check (and, likely, wouldn't
have been able to change it if I had been there, since we had to go and it
takes time to re-do that stuff).  Normally, however, Narns write right to

From:  Jms at B5       

Thanks.  The job of the show is to ask questions and pose scenarios for
discussion, while at the same time entertaining, which is our primary
responsibility.  

I wouldn't say there's any one dominant area here, whether Kabalistic or
strictly Judaeo/Christian or otherwise...it's a hodgepodge of elements.  You
can find historical, religious, social and political echoes to a lot of
things.  In the area you mentioned, there's bits and pieces of the two areas
you singled out, plus buddhism, moslemism, zoroastrianism, Zen, catholicism,
you name it, because it helps to create an authentic feel to the alien
cultures and other aspects of the show.  Similarly, there are aspects of WW
2, WW 1, Korea, Vietnam, JFK...I try to grab from lots of different areas so
that it avoids being about The One Thing and becomes a synthesis that is
about *us* in all our various permutations.

The story just kinda shifted away from that for a while; I try not to stay

we emphasized Earth stuff for the first 11 or so episodes; then we slide back
into the Centauri stuff, then the Minbari, then the Narn.  Aspects of the
show rise and fall in prominence as needed for the story.  We'll get back to
the pilots in the fullness of time.

From:  Jms at B5       

What I'd said, and maybe I wasn't sufficiently clear, but my sense was that I
wasn't going to change it *prior to the first US airing.*  I found out about
the mistake -- it was a typo, I knew the difference, I just became
momentarily stupid and wrote west when I meant to type east -- after the show
aired in the UK, and had a couple of months in which I could've chosen to
make the change.  But I was concerned that the dub wouldn't have the same
power as the original performance, so I was willing to let it go until after
it aired, so it would've had that impact, then make the change later.
Happily, the loop came out *very* well, so it worked out.

The Ranger colony was financially supported by the Minbari; the Drazi allowed

If humans are special, and in some measure we are or we wouldn't be in the

is something very unique about us which comes in handily in the series.

Subj:  Re:Renewal Process
Date:  96-03-26 17:10:05 EST
From:  Jms at B5       

The renewal process for B5 is a little different than the norm, due to the
PTEN structure.  It works in two parts, as I understand it.  (If I'm
incorrect on any of this, I hope that any of the onlooking WB folks will set
me straight.)

Part one comes from the stations.  Each market looks at the show, and how
it's doing in their area, which is a combination of ratings and demographics,
and sometimes audience support for a show, though the first two always take
precedence over the third.  They then decide whether or not to offer to take
the show for another season.

Part two comes from WB and the national advertisers.  As the stations line up
yea or nay, you keep a running tally of how *many* stations, when they want
to air it, and if they want to do a double run or not.  You need a certain
percentage of major markets, national coverage, to get national sponsors; and
you need to guarantee them a certain number of viewers.  Best if you can
deliver a certain *kind* of viewer, the kind advertisers look for.

The last part of WB's decision is if the show is profitable for the company
given all of these elements.  (WB gets the advertising money for national
spots in general, while local stations can sell other spots for local
sponsors, generating their income.)  Unlike most TV shows, which can run at a
deficit for a number of years, on the theory that they'll make it up in
long-term syndication, our show and Kung Fu have to show a profit *from the
word go*.  So the bear is much closer to us at all times.

The problem that all syndicated shows are currently running into is that of
diminishing berths for their programs.  Most communities have, at most, 1 or
2 local independent stations.  When B5 went on the air, these were all
available to us.  Since then, the Warners Network and UPN have come into
existence, with contractual requirements mandating x-hours per week for their
programs.  And Fox stations have grown, expanded their range of programming.
So now you find that there are fewer and fewer available timeslots for
syndicated shows not affiliated with one of these weblets.  A number of new
syndicated shows announced recently have been pulled for the simple reason
that they can't find enough stations that have available slots.

It's a noose around our neck that we're definitely aware of, particularly
given the importance of double runs for the national sponsors, which is even
*more* difficult given the current glut of programs and the few slots
remaining.  The game is trying to finish the story and get out before the
noose closes around our neck.  

It's going to be tight....

I think the WB net would be very doubtful, since they're trying to create

work against that; UPN is Paramount and I think they'd cut off their
own...er...noses before taking on B5, given our relative histories.

Yes, this is the primary jumpgate for Earth.  It's positioned at Io (most of
the base is actually in orbit outside Io, some of it on the surface, as we
showed in "Chrysalis") to keep Earth a bit safer by removing it some
distance, and because putting it near the huge energy field of Jupiter makes
it more difficult for weapons to target it from a distance.  It's mainly a
tactical decision.

We could've sold it a lot faster, and easier, if we'd taken some different
approaches -- dumbed it down a little, dropped the ongoing story, made it a
bit less ambitious -- but then it wouldn't be the story I wanted to tell.

And yes, the bits and pieces add up, and gain further weight by seeing how
they relate to different parts of the story.  It's a very careful, elegant
little dance which I think will be seen even more clearly once we go to daily
syndication.
