ErinM   
    It's nice to have you with us tonight!

Jms at B5       
    Glad to be here.

BB at B5
    It's great to be here.

Jms at B5
    Glad to be anywhere.  Just glad.

ErinM
    Glad to hear it. We've got plenty of questions, so we'll plunge
    right in.

Question
    Thank you for the rotation of the stars as viewed from the end of
    the rotating station.  How were the technical difficulties you
    mentioned on the USENET newsgroup overcome?

Jms at B5
    We yanked out the actual window on the observation dome....  and
    did the whole thing as a CGI composite, using CGI to create the
    bars of the....  window.  A real pain, but the effect is cool.  ga

Question
    For Bruce: With the legacy of "Star Trek," do you find that fans
    compare you to any of those characters?

BB at B5
    I don't really think so.

Question
    First, congratulations to Bruce on his recent marriage.  I hope
    Melissa and you have many happy years together. Now to Joe. Having
    attended a number of SF cons I noted the growing popularity of B5.
    How about the mainstream audience?  Magazines?

Jms at B5
    We do seem to be crossing over quite a bit; I hear via email and in
    letters from folks....  who've never watched SF before that they're
    getting into our show, so I think we're....  definitely getting
    crossover folks.  ga

Question
    Will this years episodes resolve or will this be a carry over in to
    next year.  they are progressing at an exciting level each week.

Jms at B5
    A lot will be resolved this year, but as this is a novel, you can't
    resolve too much at...  this early a stage; you're only a couple of
    chapters into the book.  ga


Question
    Has the show been officially picked up for another season?

Jms at B5
    We'll know come April/May.  ga


Question
    Hey Bruce, great show, I was just wondering, is it hard for you to
    remember the script, because of all the alien names and technical
    jargon?

BB at B5
    In the beginning it was a challenge...  But, I'm much more
    comfortable with the world of B5 now. ga


Question
    JMS:  Is it true that B5 already has an ending written?  I

Jms at B5
    It's absolutely correct; this was written and constructed as a
    novel, with a beginning,...  middle and end.  When it's over, it's
    over.  I grew up on the classics of SF literature...  FOUNDATION,
    CHILDHOOD'S END, DUNE, LORD OF THE RINGS....  and wanted to know,
    why hasn't anyone done this for TV?  So I figured I woud.  ga


Question
    JMS - how long has each of the races has jump gate technology?

Jms at B5
    Varying lengths depending on the species.  ga


Question
    When will we see the first line of Babylon 5 toys and computer
    games?

Jms at B5
    Some is out this month, from Micromachines...  small B5 micro
    machines, some shirts, a screen saver, that sort of thing.  The
    soundtrack from Christopher Franke is out this month.  It's nifty.
    ga


Question
    Do you think our society, right now, either needs a place like B5
    or has a place like B5?

Jms at B5
    Newark?

BB at B5
    I think it's man's desting to leave the planet and...  a station
    like B5 would be necessary to establish...  our foothold in the
    stars. ga

Jms at B5
    We have to leave here; the planet will eventually fill up...  or
    die when the sun dies, so we have to leave the cradle and go next
    door.  ga


Question
    Give us some tid-bit on the future of the show?

Jms at B5
    That would be telling.  Okay...things get worse.  Then they get
    better.  Then they get worse again...  then lots of stuff blows
    up...people die...others are born...more stuff blows up...  and
    then it ends.  ga


Question
    How has Bruce seen his character developing so far, and what is the
    prognosis?

BB at B5
    I've gone from being a reactor to an inniator...  And have started
    to experience a spirtaul awakening. ga

Jms at B5
    We're happy he's been able to save my crappy scripts.


Question
    When will we get to see how the President was assasinated and by
    whom?

Jms at B5
    You already have. ga


Question
    How many episodes are left for this year?

Jms at B5
    Nine more to air, 4 more to shoot. ga


Question
    JMS how did you decide onthe design of the station?

Jms at B5
    I told Ron that I wanted it to be able to produce gravity the old
    fashioned way...  via rotation, have different levels, all
    that...he and Steve (T2) Burg came up with the...  preliminary
    design, as did Peter Ledger, and it looked cool, my first
    requirement.  ga


Question
    will there be any love interests for sheridan??

Jms at B5
    god i hope not.  ga

BB at B5
    Hopefully a nice labrador retreiver. ga

Jms at B5
    JUST KIDDING

Jms at B5
    So you dumped the german shepherd?  ga


Question
    Will we be seeing any Vorlons outside they're "Encounter Suits"
    this season?

Jms at B5       Yup.  ga


Question
    Will Michael O'hare ever figure prominently in the show again?

BB at B5
    Come on no gossip on the board.:)

Jms at B5
    We'll see him again, but not in the same capactity, or the same
    extent.  ga


Question
    Several times we've heard reference to 3 Minbari castes, yet in
    "Grail," Lennier says there are two.  Was this a clue or an
    oversight?

Jms at B5
    He was being snobbish and forgot the 3rd caste.  fa


Question
    Is B5 doing well in the ratings and if so, do you still see the
    series going all five years?

Jms at B5
    (Can't be writer error) Ratings are good, and we are cautiously
    optimistic.  ga


Question
    Will there be more Peter David episodes?  I really liked the last
    one.

Jms at B5
    One more this season, "And There all the Honor Lies"...it's about
    Judge Ito.  ga

Question
    Are the books and comics considered canon?

Jms at B5
    Mostly, yes; though the details will get fuzzy, of necessity, with
    divers hands.  ga


Question
    Are you bringing back Chekov in the finale?

ErinM
    Chekov = Walter Koenig :)

Jms at B5
    we'll see...nothing's set.  I know Bruce enjoyed working with
    Walter, yes, Bruce?  ga

BB at B5
    It's an honor to work with an icon of scifi tv. ga


Question
    How did the departure of the previous commander alter your
    intentions for the series?

BB at B5
    $Very funny we'll come down an unplug your computer.

Jms at B5
    Not at all; with the original commander, we could do a, b and c;
    now we can do...  a, b, c and D, and D is *very* cool; also
    remember that his connection was mainly...  to the Minbari; I
    needed someone with a connection to the shadows, and making...
    Sinclair that person would be too much to believe, with all the
    rest.  ga


Question
    For Bruce, Do you have any desire to go up in the Space Shuttle or
    otherwise leave the Earth?

BB at B5
    Definitely, whose got a ticket.

Jms at B5
    I think there's a ga there.  Hell, Erin, I get scared crossing the
    street.  ga


Question
    To BB...TRON was a technically innovative film for its time 15
    years ago.  How did you feel about doing that film?

BB at B5
    Very excited. Though unsure of what the final film would look
    like...  and very surprised that it's still popular today. ga


Question
    What romantic possibilities do you have in store for Delenn?

Jms at B5
    Just one.  ga

ErinM
    No hints, Joe?

Jms at B5
    What?  Did I say something?

ErinM
    About the one romance?

Jms at B5
    What?

ErinM
    OK, I guess no hints about the romance. :)


Question
    Do the actors have much imput  to plot or dialog?

BB at B5
    Not really.  If there's a question about dialogue or character, Joe
    is always receptive. ga.

Jms at B5
    Good answer.  You'll actually get paid this week.  ga

Question
    JMS, are you ever worried about looking too much like all the other
    Sf shows?

Jms at B5
    What other SF shows?  There are other SF shows?  Not really....  we
    have a unique look, and feel, and our story is unlike anything else
    on the air...  I don't think you can live your life or make your
    show by worrying about the other guy...  follow the quiet turning
    of your own considered conscience.    ga


Question
    I love Girabaldi-is he patterned after anyone/character?

Jms at B5
    There's a lot of me in Garibaldi; I never have known when to shut
    the hell up.  ga


Question
    Bruce, congratulations on your marriage.  I would like to  know if
    you and Melissa are planning to make another movie together?

BB at B5
    Yes.  This summer we will be in a miniseries for NBC that will be
    shot in Europe. ga


Question
    Star Trek has had 3 spin-offs And seven movies, Will we be seeing
    more B5 related series or maybe even a movie?

Jms at B5
    While there's always been one possible offshoot of the B5 series, I
    really don't...  want to create *A FRANCHISE* (tm)...I want to tell
    THIS story, about THESE people...  and once finished, get off the
    stage.  ga


Question
    JMS:  You have said that the characters reflect some aspects of
    your personality.  Have you ever made a deal as bad as Londo's?

Jms at B5
    Ask Bruce's agent.  JUST KIDDING.  My family history is notorious
    for bad deals.  Me, I keep it in the mattress.  ga

BB at B5
    Just wait til next year, Joe.  Motorhomes and hot and cold running
    blondes.

Jms at B5
    Your point being...?

BB at B5
    Deals, we're talking deals..not telepaths. ga

Jms at B5
    (dial tone)  Oh, hi, is Melissa there?  Never mess with a writer in
    a written forum, actor-boy!  DOES ANYONE HAVE A QUESTION TO SAVE US
    FROM OURSELVES?

ErinM   We've got one right here:


Question
    JMS - how hard was it to pitch the show with ST:DS9 already being
    made/shown?

Jms at B5
    We didn't.  B5 was created 1986/87, and was being pitched years
    before there was DS9.  We even pitched it to Paramount in 1989.
    There has never been an overlap.  ga


Question
    Jm, how do you feel about being compared to George Lucas as regards
    to your depth of story line and the vision you have of B5?  Jms at
B5
    I think I'm slightly taller, but he has a GREAT beard.  Hey, it's a
    great compliment, and if I can create something that will endure as
    has...  his work, that's terrific, but for me to consider it now
    would be delusions of adequacy. g


Question
    To Bruce: How would you compare working on B5 to scarecrow or
    Bring'em back alive?

Jms at B5
    but for me to consider it now...delusions of adequacy.

Jms at B5
    echo   echo

BB at B5
    Each series has its own unique distinctions...  Babylon 5 is
    different experience, but it has some of the same...  elements as
    the others, action, adventure, and intriquatly woven plots and
    depth of character. ga


Question
    Why not have a lighter theme on the show from time to time, as in
    "The Trouble With Tribbles"?  It seems so heavy at times.

Jms at B5
    We have always alternated a bit; SOUL MATES was a light ep; so
    was...  GEOMETRY...I just don't want to get too camp or funny.  ga


Question
    To JMS: What are the chances of seeing episodes from the first
    season showing up in reruns sometime soon?  Jms at B5
    I haven't a clue; probably after this season has run ful length.
    ga


Question
    Bruce, did you train as an actor and if so,, where?

BB at B5
    At the Goodman Theatre in Chicago for three years...  then with one
    of the top acting coaches here in Hollywood. ga


Question
    you have both had experience with SF before... are you guys into SF
    outside of your work on B5, or is it just what you do best?

Jms at B5
    Bruce, you're from Chicago, yes?

BB at B5
    Yes, northwest of the city.

Jms at B5
    I've always been an SF reader, plus horror, dark fantasy, you name
    it; I think...  it's vitally important, if you're going to do an SF
    show, that you hire somebody who...  KNOWS SF.  This generally
    isn't done.  I grew up on Matheson, Bradbury, Ellison...
    Lovecraft, Bloch, Clarke, Asimov, Serling...name it.  I love it.
    ga

BB at B5
    Yes.  I'm reading the works of Arthur C. Clark right now.  $ga


Question
    For Joe: I was in England in Feb, and noticed there were a number
    of B5 conventions scheduled, as opposed to few here. Any comment on
    B5's popularity there vs. here?

Jms at B5
    I've found that B5 found an immediate home in the UK because some
    of what we're...  doing here has already been done there, in such
    continuing shows as THE PRISONER...  and our approach is somewhat
    British in nature; I"m VERY pleased by the...  reception the show
    has found over there.  But what can one expect from a country...
    where they actually eat something called Bubble and Squeak?  ga


Question
    JMS: when did Minbari stride into your mind? How long have you
    known  your  various aliens?

Jms at B5
    1986/87.  They've always been there in the story.  Minbar I named
    after...  the pulpit in a mosque.  Delenn comes from delen, Middle
    English for divided.  ga


Question
    I've heard that some people are having a hard time locating the
    show, that it's been pulled on some stations.  Are there any plans
    or rumors of being picked up by network, maybe Warner Bros?

Jms at B5
    Nothing has been discussed there; we'll see, but they're
    competitive, so I wouldn't...  count on it.  ga


Question
    with the sudden rush of SF projects now, is there a possibility of
    bad SF like the sitcom deluge of the 70's or is it too expensive to
    make bad SF?

Jms at B5
    Bad SF/good SF cost the same.  It's the people who make the
    difference, and the...  stories.  I think we may see a bit more,
    but not a lot.  ga


Question
    Jms, what can you tell us about the "GrimJack" project?

Jms at B5
    Not much at this time; I'll be doing the script after we finish
    this season's B5.  ga


Question
    Bruce:  Have you had many scenes in which you had to interact with
    CGI sets or characters, and if so, do you find it challenging?

BB at B5
    Yes, yes, yes, yes. ga


Question
    To Bruce... Would you if the show has the longevity as  Star Trek
    mind the kind of fan attention and following such as Patrick
    Stewart BB at B5
    Not at all, it would be quite flattering. ga


Question
    When writing novels many writers say the characters take over the
    plot - has this happened in B5 yet?

Jms at B5
    To some extent, yes...  when you only have the characters in your
    head, they sound like who you've made;...  after a while, actors
    get into the picture, and then the characters start to sound
    like...  the actors, and the actors sound like the characters...and
    elements of personality...  begin to infuse your brain, and
    somewhere along the line you're writing a script,...  minding your
    own business, when a characters says, HEY!  I AIN'T DOING IT!  And
    then you see someone for serious therapy....  But it's a sign that
    the characters are alive, and feisty, and fun, and they can...
    surprise you; and if they can surprise ME, they'll surprise YOU.
    ga


Question
    It was interesting that the Narn were cast this season as
    sympathetic characters, when in the previous season we were primed
    to prefer the Centauri.  Who's idea was this? I like this plot arc
    a lot.

Jms at B5
    Divine revelation....  I was walking down the street and a bag
    person said, "Hey, change your characters..  all around."  That was
    always the intent when I created the show; come up with...  what
    appears to be the standard SF line: bad guy, good guy, ally...and
    then start..  moving the chairs around.  ga

BB at B5
    Nothing is what it seems on B5.


Question
    who could we contact to make sure B5 is renewed???  Jms at B5
    Your local station.  Write 'em.  ga


Question
    do you have any plans to continue the story when the first 5 yrs
    gave been completed? I hope so!!!

Jms at B5
    Bruce: what do you like most/least about your role?

BB at B5
    Most - my nifty uniform and starfury...  Least, the food in the
    Zocalo restaurants. ga

Jms at B5
    And when did you first fall in love with my writing?  never mind.

BB at B5
    Before the wardrobe fitting....oh, great writer-boy. ga

Jms at B5
    (Memo: tighter pants for captain.)  ga Er...not really; nothing
    firm (re: the story continuing)...one crisis at a time.  (Was
    having too much fun and missed the question) ga

ErinM
    Folks, it seems like Joe and Bruce are having way too much fun back
    in the B5 offices...  right now. :)

Jms at B5
    (checking contract to see if the term writer-boy is present)

ErinM
    Back to the questions...


Question
    Considering the high skills of the design department for creating
    (and making reality) new alien species, can we expect any
    mechanical type characters in the future?

Jms at B5
    Nothing planned at the moment, no.  ga


Question
    How did you get Harlan Ellison on as a consultant to the show?

Jms at B5
    I asked him.  ga (He's a buddy.)


Question What is the Minbari chain of command ?Satai on down

Jms at B5 That's classified.  I could tell you, but then I'd have to
kill you.  ga

Question
    Congratulations on yesterday's (today's) #1 rating.  We fans are
    busting our tails trying to recruit new vewers.  How does this
    feather affect the syndication advertising and visibility?

Jms at B5
    Every little bit helps; and we're very pleased and gratified.  ga

BB at B5
    We need the support of all our viewers. ga


Question
    When does the big war really break out?  All this build up is
    making me bite my nails.  Jms at B5
    Later this sesaon, and bigtime next season.  ga


Question
    Will we eventually find out more about Kosh?  In which season?

Jms at B5
    This sesaon.  Bigtime.  ga


Question
    For BB..You've done Sci-Fi before (Tron) and Westerns. Which is
    more difficult and why? Or are they similar in some ways?

BB at B5
    Very similar in that both deal with stories set on frontiers...
    it's hard to say what is more difficult.  Each has its own
    distinctive challenges...  whether it's mounting a horse and riding
    out of a scene...  or flying a starfury and doing battle in space.
    ga

Jms at B5
    And get that damned horse off stage A, by the way.  ga

BB at B5
    Ok, I'm bringing in to your office.  :)

Jms at B5
    Who would notice one more horse's ass in my office?


Question
    JMS, will the Vorlons play a role larger than what they have now?

Jms at B5
    Most definitely.  ga


Question
    Will we be seeing any more of Ngrath in future episodes?  He just
    kinda seemed to drop out of sight.

Jms at B5
    not planned for now, no.  ga


Question
    Bruce, does JMS share future plot developments with you, or do you
    just have to take each script as it comes, and try to build on your
    character episode by episode?

Jms at B5
    (This I gotta hear.)

BB at B5
    From time to time, during the season, we talk about where Sheridan
    is going as a character...  on the day to day, week to week, I try
    not to think too far ahead...  because in actuality I try to *be in
    the moment* with my performance. ga

Question
    JMS-Welcome, I've heard that you previously wrote a novel unrelated
    to B5-fact or fiction?  And if so where  is it?

Jms at B5
    I've written two published novels; OTHERSYDE and DEMON NIGHT, plus
    an...  anthology of short stories, TALES FROM THE NEW TWILIGHT
    ZONE, both now...  out of print; I have my next novel planned, and
    will write it when B5 is done.  ga


Question
    JMS, love the show.  Has anything surprised you during the creation
    of the series?

Jms at B5
    Everything has surprised me.  Mainly that it's as good as it is,
    that we've had such...  terrific actors, the sets and efx are
    better than I'd ever hoped...  it's just been a nice surprise on
    just about every level (until tonight's conference.) ga


Question
    Bruce, did you find it difficult coming in to an already
    established show?

BB at B5
    Not really.  I was received warmly and everyone is very
    professional and we got on with the work.  ga


Question
    BB:  What is the most challenging aspect of your role?

BB at B5
    Maintaining the authority of command that is Sheridan's everyday
    experience.  Also...  drinking the morning coffee. ga

Jms at B5
    (Also the hassle of translating the scripts from Urdu into
    English.)

BB at B5
    You said it no me, Bwahana

Jms at B5
    By the way, anyone looking on should see right off that we have a
    lot of...  fun here at the show; it's a good, loose bunch...  And
    I'm calling Bruce's agent tomorrow.

ErinM   Uh-oh. Back to the questions...


Question
    JMS:  The show is excellent!  Will Harlen Ellison write any
    episodes?

Jms at B5
    In the fullness of time, he tells me.  And by an act of faith I've
    come to believe him  ga


Question
    Joe, what do think of Newsweek's naming you one of the fifty most
    influential people in cyberspace?

Jms at B5
    Well, it's nice, but that + 5$ will get me a cup of coffee at...
    the Fame is Fleeting Cafe.  Still, they noticed the show, and
    that's good.  ga


Question
    Bruce: what has the most challenging episode been for you so far,
    and why?

Jms at B5
    (Someone is singing outside my office.  How weird.)

BB at B5
    The episode we just finished filming today.  It's called In the
    Shadow of Za'Ha'Dum and my character deals with some very...
    personal issues. ga

Question
    Will there be any novels telling us about the past of the B5
    universe so we have the background of the series?

Jms at B5
    I wouldn't mind seeing them one of these days, but again there are
    no plans for them...  again, remember, I've generally held back on
    ancillary stuff; let's get THE SHOW right...  then the rest will
    attend to itself.  ga


Question
    will there be soundtracks for each of the seasons?  I'd be very
    happy if there are, because I like the music for second season as
    much as for the first.

Jms at B5
    BY HAPPY COINCIDENCE...the first soundtrack comes out this
    month...  and if it sells well, I'm sure there will be more.
    (Hint, hint.) ga

Jms at B5
    And Chris Franke does GREAT work for us.


Question
    What efforts have been made to design the alien languages and
    symbols that we see every week?

Jms at B5
    Y'know, John Copeland is lurking on BB's computer.......oh, John,
    you wanna do this?

BB at B5
    Weeellll, we invested quite a bit of effort during the making of
    the pilot at creating the alien...  languages.  We're still working
    on refining them from season to season.  But they do make sense
    if...  you know how to translate them.  ga

Jms at B5       (BB=Bruce...so is a PPG a BB gun?)

ErinM   That was producer John Copeland speaking through Bruce's screen
name.

BB at B5
    $Look out Joe he's coming down the hall.


Question
    How did you come up with the configurations for the ships on B5,
    especially for the race of the people who destroyed the Narn
    Colony?

Jms at B5
    Also Judge Crater speaking through John.  Tha's a Ron Thornton
    deal; he designs our ships, and where he gets his ideas...  only
    Ron and his therapist know for sure.  ga


Question
    SO the files I see on the internet forum for B5 are the stories
    there from you  (the creator??)  or is that just some
    hoax,......and is it just someone claiming to be you..?

Jms at B5
    Depends on what files you're referring to; I"m there a lot, and my
    stuff has been...  archived to within an inch of its life.  ga


Question        
    When will we see the return of Babylon 4.

Jms at B5       
    Next season.  Probably.  ga


Question
    JMS: The character of Ivanova seems to be used more to balance the
    other character changes..i.e. picking up some "Sinclair" type lines
    and more Londo of old type humour.  Is this deliberate on your part
    to help balance the scripts?

Jms at B5
    Ivanova is in general something of a fulcrum upon which elements
    turn; I don't thnk I...  created her with that specific role in
    mind, that's just the way she is; there's a lot of.  the standard
    russian humor I grew up with in her, so that bleeds over.
    Equal...  parts astonishment and horror.  ga


Question        
    Is the pilot going to be reshown or available on video anytime?
Jms at B5       
    One certainly hopes so.  ga


Question
    Years ago, Battlestar Galatica had the most expensive budget on air
    ($1 mil/episode)...  How does yours compare for today?  Are the
    comp. anim. effects going down in cost, or up?

Jms at B5
    Without giving out details, we do our show for about 1/2 the
    DS9/Voyager budget.  ga


Question
    JMS:  Thank you for B5.  How long does it take to complete an
    episode from begining to completion?

Jms at B5
    A couple months,factoring in editing, writing, filming, scoring and
    mixing.  ga 52 days, John tells me.  (feels like months.) And
    couynting weekends, that IS two months.


Question        
    What planet is shown behind the B5 Station?

Jms at B5       
    Epsilon 3.
    In the Epsilon Eridani system.
    ga


Question        
    Will you put out a technical manual?

Jms at B5       
    We've discussed it, nothing firm.  (See above.)
    ga

Question        
    Will Mira Furlan's makeup as Delenn change any further?
Jms at B5       
    Lord I hope not.  ga
    We love it as is.


Question
    I know on the newsgroups there is a lot of carrying on (and on and
    on) about scientific accuracy -- does it upset you when they do
    this?  I really like the CHARACTERS, and prefer that and the story
    aspects of the show far more than the science.

Jms at B5
    We try to be as accurate as we can; generally it helps the drama;
    if it gets in the...  way, we pretend we don't see the science and
    hope it'll go away.  ga


Question        
    What are the chances of an animated series in the coming years?

Jms at B5       
    EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEK!
    Zip!  None!  Nada!  El-nopo!
    (calming self down...an animated Londo...isn't that redundent?)
    ga
