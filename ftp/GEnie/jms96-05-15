     The chrysalis machine came originally from Epsilon 3, with the
rest of the equipment.

     No, no eep yet.  What other forums have you been hearing stuff?

     Bruce wanted to do the show, we said sure.  That's kind of it....

     Kwicker...no, in the original episode, the suit was always blue.
We sometimes make mistakes, but we ain't nearly THAT stupid.

     There's a chance that the rights situation may work itself out by
mid-Summer on Grimjack; if so, I might be able to peel off some time in
the Fall/Christmas hiatus period to work on it.

     The stabalizer fell off in two pieces; the outer part or shell on
the white star, the other half later that was clipped to his belt.

     Linda: at least one out of those three will come into play again
this season.

     This is Kung Fu's last season, yes.

     Mike: the Disney situation is unique to Disney; they are all
engulfing, totally dictatorial, and everything that comes out of there is
incestuous as hell.  There's a reason most anybody who's worked for them 
refers to the place as Mauschwitz....

     RE: Space A&B...yes, the word is it's been canceled.  It's
amazing to look at the SF shows that have come and gone just in the time 
that B5 has been around: S:A&B, Space Rangers, VR5, SeaQuest, Earth 2, 
and on.

                                                                  jms

     "WB wanted some product placement using stuffed animals...."

     Never happened.  Jerry is...embroidering.

     Space Rangers came on at the same time as B5.

     The energy being that got Sheridan in "Knives" had no relation to
anything in the ongoing story; it just existed outside our normal
universe, and got in and out via the rift (which also served to remind us 
that it was still there).

                                                                 jms

     PS, it's one thing, I think, to spend 2 hours in a movie theater
and get a downer ending...another to invest 5 years of your life and then 
it all goes to hell.  I think they'd crucify me for that.  And I think 
they'd be right.

     The new edition is, basically, an entirely new book.  One of the
reasons it took me 3 years to get the damned thing in was that I'm a
perfectionist, and couldn't just update the pay info, I had to rewrite 
the thing from stem to stern (I think only the playwriting chapter is 
more or less the same), updating all the information, tossing aside 
suggestinos (suggestions) that were no longer appropriate in this market, 
adding new info about changes in the fields, adding new chapters on 
animation, computers, and the like...it's a whole different book now.

                                                                 jms

     BTW, for those in LA, I'll be doing Mike Hodel's Hour 25 on
KPFK-FM 90.7 this Friday night from 10 p.m. to midnight.

     I'm often tempted to create Zathras' brother, Mathras, or
somesuch, if only for the look of terror in their eyes when he says, of 
Zathras, "Ah, yes...Zathras...was the quiet one in the family...."

     Who knows, it might be something I might do someday....
