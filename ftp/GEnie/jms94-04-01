     How much of any episode's dialogue is looped depends on whether or not
the line was clear on the mike, if there was on off-camera noise, and other
factors.  Sometimes there's almost none, sometimes there's a lot.

     Stories become more problematic in direct proportion to the complexity of
the suggestion.  If it's a one-liner, or a brief thought, that's not too
problematic.  If it's a lengthy discussion of a possible story...THAT'S a
problem.  It lets someone say, "Hey!  My story had 52 specific notions, and 52
of those are in his story, so I wuz robbed."   It's really a question of
degree, courtesy and intent.

     And the writing credit on MOTFL was jms.

     The refraction depends on the angle you're viewing it from, so it does
vary a bit.

     Bits and pieces...at Phil & Ed's Excellent Convention in Burbank the
other day, I saw my first B5 hall costume...very well done, actually, a B5
command-rank uniform, which was *very* detailed and authentic looking.   It
actually took me a second to realize that this wasn't one of ours, but rather
an impressive simulation.

     (VERY strong reaction from folks there about the show, all positive.)

     Also, I'm tentatively planning to show "Signs and Portents" at I-CON that
Saturday.  There are several to choose from, but since that one's a real blow-
out, that seemed the best choice.

     I'm also *very* eager to see the audience reaction to something in
there....

     Actually, no, I don't believe John Flinn was our DP on the pilot movie.
The series is a *tad* lighter than the pilot, but not much.  Re: the grainy
aspect...this is happening *after* we turn over the episodes on digital (D2)
format.  Apparently the company that PTEN uses to drop in the commercials (one
dub), do the closed captioning (another dub) and other stuff (total: five
generations down) was doing so on *analog one inch tape*...and, we recently
discovered, using *USED STOCK*.  Neither PTEN nor anyone else noticed this or
was aware; we noticed the substantial difference in picture and audio quality,
and began backtracking it and found this out.  Starting with "War Prayer"
we've been able to correct some of this (with considerable yelling), and will
in time correct the rest.  Also, some TV stations are downlinking to less than
effective stock, which doesn't help.  The image that leaves here on D2 is VERY
sharp, with nicely saturated colors.

     Don't write to Seagram's; if you want to help support the show, it's best
to write your local station.

     I think Mira's coming here simply because she's heard about it from me
and others, such as Arne.  And yes, I'd say she's coming *here*.

     The minbari warrior caste leader who committed suicide rather than issue
the surrender command was Sineval.

     Yeah, that's kind of how I figured it would go, and one reason I wasn't
real sanguine on this from the start.  As for Ordover's behavior, from what
I've seen of him on the forums, that seems about par for the course.

     We expect to know around the second week of May.  Because of the recent
entry of Paramount's new network, which is grabbing up stations left and
right, nothing in the current marketplace is a lock, so we'll see what we will
see.  They're really hoping that ST spinoff #3 will be sufficient bait --
offering the guaranteed ST franchise -- to help close down other venues and
other competing shows.

     It has *always* been my sense that the body was slipped out an access
airlock in the zero-g cargo area.  Every other access -- like the boarding
area and standard cargo area -- is under close security to prevent this kind
of thing, or the influx of contraband.  There's really nowhere to GO from the
zero-g section, so it's a little looser.  As for how he got the body
there...there is an answer, and a reason, and if you look at this episode
again after the season is over, even the nitpickers who brought it up will be
able to figure it out.  I didn't address it in the issue because I didn't
think anyone would make a federal case out of this, and for other reasons that
will in time become apparent.  Several other nits picked at this episode will
*also* be clarified by season's end.  It's not easy to sit quietly, knowing
the answer, and being unable to tell it, but that's simply what I have to do
for the time being.

                                                                   jms

     The zero-g cargo section extends from the front of B5 well into the
middle of the station, *inclusive* of red sector, which is below it.

     I'm never optimistic.  As far as pickup is concerned, it's very
basic...the Paramount network, as stated, is making inroads, pressuring
stations to sign onto the new network or else they won't get the proven,
guaranteed, franchise, new ST series.  Independent stations only have so many
available hours, which is putting a real crunch on the syndicated marketplace.
Whatever people may think, a second season is not a lock.  I wouldn't have
asked people to express their support, *especially* to the local stations,
just to jerk people around.  I take that kind of request very seriously, and
wouldn't ask unless I felt it was useful.

     I am hopeful, and certainly there are many positive signs...but at the
same time, as I've said before, this is one town where hope can kill you.

     Located above the station proper is the long zero-g cargo loading area.
You'll see, in later episodes, ships pulling up in front of the area and
offloading cargo.  That is accessible from many parts of the station.

     As an example...in the next-to-last shot in "Survivors," someone is
entering a ship in the docking bay.  The only real object in that room, aside
from the actor, is a ladder.  Everything else is CGI...but you can't tell.

     Unless you're planning to do monstrous amounts of blue-screen work,
making stars go left to right (or right to left) is easy; ST uses a star
curtain, which simply is on a loop running in the right direction (when they
don't use blue screen).  Stars out of the B5 window would be going in a
CIRCLE...which would require a star WHEEL of *enormous* size.  We were able to
trick the camera using camera moves in the pilot to make the stars move, but
have found it more difficult to do this on the series.  We have some ideas on
how to fix this for a (hopefully) second season.

                                                                     jms

     In "Survivors," we attempted a cgi/composite shot out the window, which

     There are some gender-based differences, yes.

     No one has seen the entire series outline.  Three people have seen a ten-
page synopsis of the full five-year story, and are sworn to absolute secrecy
about it.  Larry, as I mentioned earlier, read it, and his first reaction was,
"You're out of your f*****g mind."  A second person began crying at the end of
it.  (Honest to god, I'm not making this up.)  The synopsis contains only the
broad strokes; not the details, and there's a LOT of odd stuff in the details.


     In preparation for a (hopeful) second season, I've broken out the
individual episodes/stories for year two, and let one person skim through the
breakdown, only in order to determinen production needs in advance, so we can
budget accordingly.  That's all.

     Actually, there's a second shot in which you can see a body being thrown
out; it's between Mitchell and Sinclair being hit.  Remember that the body is
strapped in in an angular fashion, and look for it as it blows (as I recall)
from left to right.  It's there.

     Seemed to go fine, though it's better to ask the audience than the person
at the front of the room...perceptions can change depending on which end of
the microphone you're on....

     Still plan on showing "Signs and Portents" at I-CON, though it'll be
tight getting that one finished in time, given the incredible amount of CGI in
it.  Also will be doing a panel there with Harlan, Michael O'Hare and Arne on
the origins of B5, and a one-man Q&A session/workshop on writing for TV.

     At this point it'll just be me, maybe Harlan (who's GoH there) on the B5
stuff.  Probably just the usual...me rambling insensibly for an hour, some
clips, maybe an episode for the convention.

     Well, I'll probably bring the gag reel, some clips, and as far as
episodes go...my *guess* at this point would be either the two-parter, or D.C.
Fontana's "Legacies."  Just about anything else would reveal stuff too early.

     As another aside...I'm surprised no one here has mentioned what
transpired just recently on CI$.  A couple of people were posting their
version of what they thought ST 7 was going to be about, in some detail, and
Paramount jumped in on jackboots and started threatening lawsuits, against the
people, against CI$, against everyone and anyone involved.   There may even
have been an injunction.  In any event, the lawyers descended en masse and
stomped on it hard.

     I would like to know the 3 times that the specific line, "There's a
shuttle leaving in two hours, be on it" was used.  I know of only one: in
"Mind War."  G'Kar said to the assassin, in "Parliament," "That's your flight,
I suggest you hurry," *in answer to a PA notice, but that's not the same thing
by any measure.  Please cite the three times you say this exact phrase was
used.  Because I don't think it's there.

     Cindy: your recollection is incorrect.  The story was *not* the real one,
so saith the people who were posting it.  They were just making it up.

     Legally, this is a very muddy and difficult area.  Which is why I have
generally avoided getting into it here.  There are always some who, upon
getting a request like this, want to drag out the legalities of why they
should or shouldn't go along with it, who says they can't do it... when from
my perspective, why are we getting into the legalities of it?  I ask it as a
*courtesy*.  I spend 3+ hours a day on these systems, and as a rule of thumb I
never ask much in return.  Even when I'm blind tired after a long day, and I
log on to find (as today) 1,075 message in my mailbox, I still make it a point
to come in every day, read everything in both B5 topics, and respond as much
as I can...and the only thing that I ask in exchange, as a courtesy,
understanding that it's a difficult area, is to refrain, where possible, from
posting significant or detailed story ideas.
 I don't see why legalities have to be argued over each time this gets brought
up.  One can argue the merits and the specifics and the letter of the law ad
infinitum...all I've said is that if they *do* start popping up here, I'll
have to excuse myself from the discussion.

     Anyone who wants to engage in elaborate story speculations and ideas can
do so privately, in email, to your heart's content.  All I ask is that you not
do it where I can see it.  I don't like having to make the request, would
*much* prefer not to do so, but the flat bottom line is that we are a lawsuit
happy country, and I cannot expose myself, my show, and PTEN to that kind of
risk.  (And please don't go over the realease form and promises discussion all
over again...we've hashed and rehashed that one, and it doesn't work.)

     Most people in this town can't believe the amount of effort that I put in
here, in an exchange which, from a strictly numerical point of view, wouldn't
notch the ratings up a fraction of a point.  But to me, it's important.  I'm
just trying to minimize the amount of danger to which I expose my show.  If
the show matters, then the request matters.

     Talia is nowhere near a P10; her basic telepathic ability remains around
P5.  The other is totally aside, in terms of mind-scans and the like.  Being
able to play the fiddle won't make you a better steel worker.

     Bear in mind, Sinclair was only out about 24-48 hours (I don't recall the
exact number).  So it wasn't that long a period of time in which to arrange a
prisoner transfer.

     Pathman...your perception comes from a slight advantage: you're here.
This has been discussed in great detail on-line, and in the various faq files,
and in my individual postings.  (About Sinclair and the Line.)  But this
group, for all its other wonderfulnesses, comprises not enough people to make
a hiccup on the ratings.  Unless off-line viewers saw the pilot MOVIE -- and
not all of them did -- this is their *first introduction* to the fact that
there was a missing 24 hours at ALL.  Most of them didn't have that prior
knowledge in order to HAVE the suspicions.

     As much as I like the online environment, one can't tailor a show  around
prior knowledge gained through this exchange.  We have to bring everyone along
*together*.
