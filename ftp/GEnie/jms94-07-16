     The first batch of mugs are from (you'll pardon the expression) Creation.

     Currently about 2/3rds finished writing a second-season ep called
"Revelations," and though I've written and commissioned others already, this
one's sizing up to be a major ass-kicker from a story perspective.
Definitely the flip-side of "Chrysalis."  Some really, really nice stuff.

     The hardest part is always writing Kosh, because you have to be very
careful how much you use him, and what he says.  Too much and he loses his
sense of mystery, and you don't want him spouting fortune-cookie  type
aphorisms.  He has a very deliberate way of speaking in which  everything,
every smallest nuance and inflection means something, but sometimes not what
it appears to mean, or comes at it from a very different angle than normal
conversation.  So I go as minimalist as possible, to get the meaning down to
the smallest number of words possible.  And in one scene, one of only two he
appears in, I got him down to *one word*, and that one word -- and it's a
totally inoffensive, neutral word on its own terms -- should scare the hell
out of *everybody*.

     Ah loves this show....

     Telepaths are the ultimate minority, and when it comes to the use of
their talents, and the protection of the rights of the hysterical majority,
their rights don't mean a whole hell of a lot.

     Yes, Mary Jo is Christian Slater's mom.  She keeps nudging us about an
appearance, since he loves SF.  We'll see.

     And also correct...the majority of freelance scripts we commission don't
tend to need a lot of revision.  Certainly not after the first go round.  DC's
first script needed a bit of work, but that was mainly because she was still
feeling her way around the characters and the show.  Her second script came in
almost letter perfect; move around a few commas and that's about it.  And her
outline for her next script, for season two, is very cool.

     Funny story.  Saw Ed Wasser ("Morden") the other day, and asked him if
he'd had any reaction to his first appearance on the show.  Just one, he said.
He was in a florist shop, picking out some stuff for a friend who was sick.
The proprieter came over, asked, "What do you want?"  Ed sorta mumbled about
wanting some flowers.  "What do you want?" the owner asked again.  Ed -- still
not getting it -- said he was looking for some nice stuff for a friend who was
sick.  "Yes, but what do you *want*?" the owner asked.  At which point Ed
finally twigged to what was going on.  He said afterward that it really *is*
an unnerving approach, which was kinda the point.

     Of course, the owner then added that he thought the scene was from DS9,
but what the hell, it's an imperfect universe.

     We're re-doing *all* of our computer displays for next year, using some
nifty graphic designs.  Part of the problem is that the boys at Foundation
were doing the displays, and they were swamped doing our main CGI, so that
kinda fell by the wayside.  This year we've got someone who does ONLY our
computer screens with us in-house.

     Glad you liked the series font, btw; I picked it out me own self.   It's
Serpentine Medium, for anyone interested.

     Yeah, just about all of our monitor stuff in scenes is done live on the
stage, rather than in post; gives it a nice sense of reality, I think.

     Re: serpentine medium...about 75% of the reason I picked that font was
because it looked cool, and 25% because I liked the name and the image it
brings to mind.

     Re: telepathy...yes, it's bordered and proscribed by physical
limitations, in many ways; the closer you are, the better you can do.   Even
Bester, in "Mind War," noted that he could shut Ironheart down, "but we have
to be on a line-of-sight to do it."  They couldn't just broadcast it into the
ether, he had to be *there* in front of them.

     The whole telepathy issue is an interesting one in the universe of B5.
There have always been attempts to prove the existence of telepathy, but in
general the findings have been inconclusive.  But about 125 years or so ago in
B5's timeline (2100-2110 and thereabouts) the findings began suddenly to tilt,
and full-blown telepaths began to be discovered.  There were some abortive and
confused attempts to legislate around this, most of which failed or were
overturned in various courts of law.  About 2150 or so, the government
agencies that regulated and oversaw telepaths were rolled over into the newly
established Psi Corps, which became a clearing house for locating,
controlling, and licensing telepaths for commercial, some very restricted
legal, and military purposes.

                                                                 jms

     Yes, a businessman can insist on having his own telepath present, or can
ask not to be scanned during negotiations...though it is a sign that one has
something to hide, and might screw the deal.  Sinclair could have asked for a
telepath on his side, but 1) that wasn't the issue, it was allowing NO
telepath to have that access, and 2) would've requird a Psi Corps military
liaison-type telepath, and none were available on station.

and a couple of other episodes.  Next season you'll also be seeing our

     Re: sound in space...I sent out the word to just about everyone to get a
consensus on this issue.  And I got back some surprising responses from a
number of physicists, including none other than Freeman Dyson.  The SF
community has always accepted, unquestioningly, almost as a shibboleth, the No
Sound In Space Is Possible theory.  But what came back from Dyson and others
says, basically, that this ain't necessarily the case.

     Eventually, I'll get around to collating all the info and uploading it
here.  (But as one example, if a ship of very large size explodes, the
atmosphere within will expand outward, carrying with it the sound of the
explosion.  It will fizzle fairly quickly, but if you're within the range of
the expanding bubble of air and sound, you'll hear something.   Also, if a
ship explodes, if you're outside the bubble, floating in space without a ship
or a helmet, no, you won't hear it, but then that doesn't matter because
you're dead.  If you're in another ship, outside the range of the expanding
air curtain, you'll hear sounds as the debris, radiation and other effects of
the explosion strike your hull, causing it to ring or otherwise reflect the
sound.)

     In any event, I think that this particular shibboleth is going to  have
to be reconsidered.

                                                                 jms

     I try not to hype shows that I like unless I know beyond a doubt that
it's absolutley kickp-ass.  I like "Voice" a lot; it is the point at which we
really start cranking, speeding things up as we barrel toward "Chrysalis."  I
think the CGi is nothing less than terrific, Christopher Franke went balls-to-
the-wall and did an *amazing* job with the music, the performances are good.
I like it a lot.  I haven't commented upon it a lot because it's kind of the
weird child in the brood; when I write, I generally write tight and fast.  By
the third act, you're *moving*.  In this case, you have to pace yourself out
*very* differently, so part of my brain keeps doing this "c'mon, speed it up,
speed it up" when I'm watching the first part because I'm used to a different
one-hour kind of pacing.

     Kathryn says I'm nuts.  But then this is nothing new.

     Anyway, I do think it's pretty cool, and does a lot with virtual sets and
composite sets.

     Yesterday, I got the final air-check versions of "Babylon Squared" and
"Chrysalis" to QC before delivering them to PTEN.  Watched both of them three
times in the same day.  They're just stunning.  Probably the two best episodes
of the entire season.

                                                                  jms

     Yeah...I love Londo's song, that whole scene.  The director wanted to cut
Ivanova's coda after her mantra, but I really felt we needed it, and it played
perfectly with her Russian character, which tends to have this unusual
relationship with higher forces (he said vaguely).  I love character based
humor, because it's very powerful once you know the characters, and it can
really blind-side you if done right.  Ivanova's reaction in the core area was
about as real as would probably happen, but it's funny to hear her *say* it.

     Basically, I thought "Legacies" was pretty good, all things considered.
I'd put it at around the center of the pack.  It didn't exactly leap off the
boards at me, but I didn't have any major problems with it, as I did with, for
instance, "Infection."  (Like the CGI composite shot of the rotunda, looking
out at the garden before panning down a lot.)

start by putting yourself in the position of an alien trying to understand us.
And if you step back for a second, we do some *very* weird stuff.  What he
says about the song is exactly right in terms of its meaning.

     On the question of dialogue, this comes under the heading of General
Editorializing, not directed to anyone in particular....

     I love monologues.  They are a legitimate part of any drama.  The MTV
generation has had its tastes so thoroughly bastardized by quick cuts,
lowering the attention span further and further, that any bite of more than
ten seconds and they start to wander, it becomes a block of words and they
blur out.

     Go rent Network by Paddy Chayefsky, watch nearly any of the TZs by Rod
Serling, go see "The Lady's Not for Burning" by Christopher Fry...all
chockablock with moments where you park for a moment and let fly with a chunk
of dialogue that smashes your head against the wall.  Not every single
exchange has to be foreshortened so that you lose the *impact* of what's being
said.  Because people's attention spans have been greatly foreshortened,
suddenly more than 3 lines at a time is somehow viewed as wrong.  It ain't.
Just that lots of folks are afraid to try it, afraid to rely on just the words
and the actors.  And sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't.  But it's
legitimate.

     The monologue in particular, done right, isn't just to convey
information, it's to create a mood, to paint pictures with words, to expand on
the obvious.  Yeah, I could've just written, "The narns hate us, we hate them,
it's equal math."  But that doesn't carry the same meaning, the same sense as
"so here we are...victims of mathematics."  The use of the word "victim"
connotes, hey, it's not my fault.  Yeah, the former is shorter, but you lose
the rhythms, the imagery, and the *sense* of what is intended.  You could say,
"The narn hate us."  But to say, "if the narns gathered together in one place,
and hated, all at the same time, that hatred would fly across dozens of light
years and reduce Centauri Prime to a ball of ash," draws a picture, lends
power to the emotion.

     Point being...I like 'em, there's nothing wrong with them, and they're
staying.

                                                                 jms

     Actually, sadly, that was Londo's first wife, who he was forced to
divorce later.  Eventually I'll get into this.

     Londo and Garibaldi really are two sides of the same coin, in some ways.
There's an odd friendship there, almost grudging; Londo had little to gain by
cheering up Garibaldi, except a drink perhaps, but that's what friends do.

     Re: the XO and second going down...my theory is that there's a First
Contact Protocol that doesn't currently exist because there's no need for it
in the present.  No aliens yet.  The Earth/Minbari War started with a botched
First Contact that nearly wiped out humanity.  You don't want junior officers
anywhere even *near* the scene.  You send your two best, who are trained in
FCP (which Sinclair referenced in "Soul Hunter," btw).  If they die, they're
replaceable.  Earth isn't.

     Two really great quotes above, btw.  We get some more nice ones in season
two, in the first two episodes.  One is from Lincoln (a little bit about
saving or losing the last best hope of Earth), the second from Yeats (what
rough beast slouching toward Bethelehem, to be born).

     Yes, that building is in the Garden.  You can see buildings there in many
shots, some better than others.  It's a big place.  The Fresh Air restaurant
is also in the Garden area, and you can see buildings there in "Purple," also
upcoming in "Quality."

     This is a terrible story, but Paul Simon, in an interview, swears that
it's true.  Someone asked him about his songs.  He said he was in a restaurant
down south, stopped in for a sandwich, long time ago.  Asked for a chicken and
egg sandwich.  The waitress called back the request to the cook, "One mother
and child reunion."

     And that's where he got the title....

     No, they are not.

     Any script broker selling copies of B5 scripts is doing so without
permission.  They are engaging in copyright infringement.  The contents of the
scripts belong to PTEN, but the physical copies belong to the writers, who get
nothing out of this.  It ruins, for instance, Christy's chance to make a few
dollars selling what is hers, if her script gets on the open market.

                                                                    jms

     One of the things we're thinking of doing, once and if we can get this B5
fan liaison office going, is to sell scripts from the show.  But unlike any
other script house (and a certain other show that sells its scripts), the
writers of the scripts sold will get a royalty off the sale of their scripts;
or, if they don't want them sold, we won't do so.   And it won't be exclusive
in any event.

     That is one of the things we hope to do with the B5 fan liaison office,
when and if we can get it going; to help defray expenses, we think we can
market a few things, including scripts of aired shows, with the proviso that
the original writer gets a royalty off the scripts, and/or can opt not to have
their script sold if they so desire.

     Yeah, I had the same conversation...suggested a structure rather like the
Winds of War, set during the Earth/Minbari War, in that we have all of our
characters in different places, seeing the story and the war from their
perspectives, and how their paths intersect during that time in odd or
unlikely ways.  Dell didn't think that was the way to go, that unless it was
set in the present, people would feel disappointed.

     Oh, well...eventually we'll get around to that part of the story.

     Insofar as I know, the designs entered in on the cruisers hasn't been
modified at all, so I can't account for any perceived differences.  And I
believe that the Minbari flyer used was the same model as Deathwalker used,
though without checking the tapes I can't be 100% sure.  It's a fairly
standard flyer.

the Chicago presentation, there isn't much need to hustle to see the one on
Friday; but you may want to be there for the Saturday one, which will be in a

     Possible that Bill Mumy will be there; don't know (doubt it) if Harlan

     (as he lay there on the mat, the referee counting slowly to ten, he
decides whether to get up, and face another barrage, or just lay there
contemplating how amazing the lights look from this perspective....)

     My problem with my current system is that it works fine with the first
item on the SCSI system, a rewriteable optical disk.  It's when I plug that
into the second device, a 6-CD rom jukebox (Pioneer 604X) that suddenly the
system begins resetting and resetting and resetting when I turn it on.  I can
only make ti stop resetting by unplugging the jukebox.  There's not a conflict
in the device number, that seems fine.  And insofar as I can tell, the
terminatin switches are set fine.  Ultrastor thinks that a jumper of some kind
needs to be installed on the car.

     All I want...please...is a computer that I can plug in, not have to mess
with, and will be able to do everything I want it to do with the DOS software
(sorry, macs) that I've grown accustomed to.  It seems like every computer
I've ever owned needs massaging, nudging, configuring, constant prayer and
occasional exorcism.  I just want it to *work right* out of the box.  Is that
really so much to ask?

     Other stupid question moment.  Back in the 50s, there was an SF series
called "Planet Patrol."  No, not "Space Patrol" (though that was what it was
called in England), "Planet Patrol."  Aired in New York on WPIX.  We're
talking here puppets, okay?  Cool martians and tube cars and rockets and space
stations and stuff.  Used to watch the show all the time when I was a kid, and
am looking for copies of the episodes.  (It was made in B&W.)  For *years*,
nobody even believed it existed; it isn't in ANY book that I'm aware of.
Finally, about 2 years ago, I got my hands on one copy of one episode from a
contact, which wasn't much, but was enough to convince everyone from holding
that planned sanity hearing.  It DOES (or did) exist.  So once every year or
two, I put out the word...if anyone here has copies of this show, or knows
where same can be gotten, I'd *very* much appreciate hearing about it.

     Kathy, it'd be great if you could find out.  Basically, if it's a show
with real actors, it's not the show I'm looking for; if it's got puppets, then
it is.  (Though sometimes I wonder at the distinction....)

     Klaatu: not the Tom Corbet space patrol, this is a different thing.

     Yeah, finally decided to screw it and bite the bullet (to mix my
metaphors a bit) and get the damned thing.  Reality is, if you wait for the
next Big Thing, you'll never buy anything.  I'd gotten paralyzed, and finally
just figured to do it.

     Going for the Dell Dimension 90mhz Pentium, 32 megs ram, 17" monitor (.26
mm resolution), 3x CD Rom, 2 1-gigabyte drives, 2 floppies, IDE controller,
 soundblaster 16, peavy speakers, trackball keyboard, and a bunch of other
stuff that's pretty much maxed out the system.  #9GXEPro video card with 2
megs memory (option of getting 2 more megs).  It's got everything short of
warp drive, and that only because it wasn't available.

     We'll see how long this one lasts....

     Pat: thanks.  Unfortunately, I really can't take the risk that everyone
has seen all prior episodes; the information needed for episode B to be clear
has to be included, even if it's a restatement of something we saw in a prior
episode.  Otherwise, I don't think we're really playing fair with the
audience, and people will start tuning out.

     "Memo to myself: don't ever compare an episode of B5 to an episode of
Star Trek without first researching the entirety of written fiction for non-
Trek precedents."

     That's a snotty response that has nothing to do with the issue that I
gigged you on.  You can compare anything to anything, I really don't care.
All that I have asked you to do is be aware of your language when you accuse
someone of stealing something?  Why is that so difficult for you to grasp?

     You keep trying to distort my point into something that it's not, and I
have no intention of letting you get away with it.  You said we did a remake
of an ST episode.  You didn't discuss the issues, you said it was a remake.
You implied the story was lifted from ST.  That is what you said.  I'm sorry
if it's now inconvenient for you, or that you got your nose caught in the
doorjam, but words mean what they mean, not what you want them to mean.

     And I find it very telling that when confronted, you announced that your
only options were to slink off or throw this in my face.  Odd that you
wouldn'd consider something like, "Sorry, it wasn't my intention to indicate
that Larry had stolen the idea.  I regret if that was implied."

     Guess that never even occured to you, did it?

     You can dance around re-interpretations all you want, Halliwell, but your
comment was rude, and pejorative, and an insult to Larry, and by association
to me.  And it's got nothing to do with comparisons or the entirety of written
fiction.  And that's clear to every person here but you.  You're evading and
backing and filling.

     You get very cavalier here about other people, about the work that others
do, their talents or lack thereof...you're always the first in line to
criticize somebody...but you don't much like it when it's you, do you?  Why
should I treat you with any more respect than you treat others?  Now, on
another day, maybe I'd just turn the other cheek, which  I do a *lot* around
here, and let it go.  But today, now, here, I don't much feel like it.  Maybe
I've heard this line once too often from people, and you're just the latest
one to get in my face with it.  Either way, maybe you'll learn something about
running one's mouth, and that words have meaning, and if you accuse somebody
of remaking somebody else's idea, you'd damned well better be prepared to back
it up, or back off and apologize.

     Or is even that modicum of civilized behavior completely beyond your
comprehension?

     We'll know in your next post whether you intend to act like a man, or a
weasel.  It's your call.

     The Starfuries are absolutely non-aerodynamic, and in the gravity well of
a planet, would simply plummet; they're not set up to function within that
kind of environment.  It isn't the re-entry, it's gravity and maneuvering once
you're *in* the thing.

     One sidelight to the speed question...it's sometimes hard to judge speed
when there are no handy landmarks.  The shuttle moves with INCREDIBLE speed as
it orbits Earth...but to look at it from any of the nearby cameras, when they
do a spacewalk, you can't tell it's moving at ALL.  Basically, we're between a
rock and a hard place; if we portrayed motion a la the Space Shuttle, nothing
would seem to move; if we portrayed the pure speed AS pure speed, using some
kind of landmarks or visual cues, it would go by SO fast that you *wouldn't be
able to see it*.  If you're moving at 15 klicks a second...it's gone by the
time you look at it.

                                                                 jms

     As I recall, as we see Sinclair's ship descend, there are small rockets
fired from the top of the nose, which points the nose down, and orients it
toward atmospheric entry.

     No, nothing was missing from the CGI shot that I know of.

     Ivanova's line: "We don't know if we can find our way back or not," not
that it was closed off.  So showing them wandering around to find another open
tunnel seemed not dramatically interesting; you have to pick what's important
and what's not, and what will work dramaticall on screen.  If she had said
"there's no other way out," then you would've had to show it.  She didn't.
One can also argue that the alien showed them which way to get out.  Either
way...all you've got is one hour to tell your story.  You can't show
everything, you have to let your audience assume some things.

     Roy: there is a quantum difference between a computer game and a TV show.
It's not "lowest common denominator," which means making the story stupid; I'm
saying that if you showed the missiles at full speed, YOU WOULD NOT SEE THEM
AT ALL.  And, again, there's nothing nearby with which to get a sense of how
fast they're going, no landmarks, so it's very hard to convey that.  Again,
look at space footage; the shuttle is going *incredibly* fast...but as far as
we can tell it looks nearly motionless, because there are no landmarks.

     Re: not explaining WHY the Starfuries can't enter the atmosphere, we did
that.  Ivanova says that they're not built to function within an atmosphere.
Now, I could stop the scene for a long dissertation on the relative
aerodynamics of planes with wings vs. starfuries, but here you say only what
you have to.  You show, don't tell.

     It seems like in the same breath, it's accused of catering to the lowest-
common denominator, and being over the head of its viewers by requiring them
to *think* about what they're seeing.

     Which means we're probably doing it right.

     No, a shuttle like this, which is designed to function in alternate
atmospheres, and may have to evacuate groups, has about 7 standard or most
common atmosphere cannisters.  Medlab has the same thing, but in larger
numbers.  This is SOP on the show.

                                                                 jms

     No, the sets weren't redresses of regular sets; they were built new and
entirely for the two-parter; you can get a better look at them in the second
part, and some angles of the first.

     It's J. Michael Straczynski because the first two let you gradully creep

     Yeah, the audio thing with Talia is something I thought of during the
final audio mix.  We wanted to convey somehow her trying to get through and
initially it was just distortion.  Then I figured, wait a second, she is going
to be thinking what she's going to say before she says it, why not pre-lap the
dialogue?  Unfortunately, for some damned reason, the high-tech studio wasn't
set up to do that effect, so we took Talia's dialogue, digitized it, laid it
in on a second side track, and played the one over the other, one preceding
the other by I think about 20 frames or so.  The key was to make the *second*
voicing the one synched to her lips, not the first one.  Worked out pretty
cool.

     In at least some of those cases, Kiwi, it's not writer's laziness; you're
not paying attention.  Delenn knew the ship was coming in at the top of the
episode; when she realized that the gun ports were open, she went immediately
to Sinclair.  Story logic.  Also story logic for the appearance of Sinclair
and Garibaldi at the cargo bay; they didn't just "wander in," they determined
what had happened, and went there knowing that there was a Minbari transport
about to head out.

come with constructive observations.  You get unvarnished "it's perfect,
change nothing," about as often as "it sucks, change everything."  Those are
rare individuals.  Mostly you get something in between.

     The use of insulting language does not guarantee a response from me.
What it does guarantee is contempt.

     It also takes a breathtaking degree of stupidity to want to take on a
writer, any decent writer really, in a written medium.

     From cradle to grave, the Minbari are taught that there is no greater
goal, no nobler thing than to serve.  They are raised to be totally self-
sacrificing.  The only exception is when someone in the religious caste
believes he or she has received a calling, which if sincerely felt cannot be
contravened (since usually this too involves serving).  So for a Minbari
telepath, this is their means by which they may serve, and they are given
great respect.  It never even occurs to them to do otherwise.

     Lately, there has been a bit of a change brewing; "a self-involvement
above the needs of others" (as someone notes in "Voice") that has begun
creeping into the Minbari race.  And they're not happy about it.

     It's bone, growing from the back of the head outward.

     Originally, this ep was to be broadcast later in the run, because I
didn't want two PsiCorps episodes back-to-back, and for one little detail that
will become clearer after "Babylon Squared" airs; it would've been better to
have followed that episode, but again, these eps are made to be watched in
just about any order, so it's okay in the long run.
