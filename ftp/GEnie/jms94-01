     I am an atheist, a total atheist, and am more than happy.  What I write
is what I write, what I am is what I is.

     Yes, much of my own background goes into what I write.  In the case of
religion, and spirituality...a writer's job is to be as honest as he can in
telling a story.  My canvas (for lack of a less grandiose term) is the human
condition.  And since the dawn of sentience, humanity has been trying to
figure out its place in the universe.  The religious impulse is as much a part
of that process as anything else, and it must be treated with integrity and
respect, as I would have my own views respected.  I try not to exclude
something just because I don't agree with it, because that corrupts the whole
purpose of writing, which requires an honest look at the subject.

     And as a writer, there are parts of the religious impulse that I want to
examine, and explore, and raise questions about, just as much as I'd like to
explore the scientific aspects of living in space, and the more personal,
emotional repercussions of this.  It's all a part of trying to figure out who,
and what, and *why* we are.

     Actually, religion isn't totally irrelevant to B5 in that in several
episodes we'll be dealing with, or touching upon that issue...there's a bit of
it in "Soul Hunter," "By Any Means Necessary," "The Parliament of Dreams,"
"Legacies," "Believers" and a couple of others.

     Fever broke a little today, so that helps.  May even go in to work for a
few hours tomorrow.

     Re: the Universe Today piece....sigh.  I wish they'd let us proof these
things before they sent them out.  That should be "Minbari POET accorded
honors," not "Minbari PIRATE."  I haven't had a chance to check out the
program yet -- no macs at home -- but plan to look at it as soon as I can.
There are a few glitches here and there apparently, plus in the electronic
trading card gifs, but easily straightened out.

     Well, we've finished shooting "Legacies," and have begun shooting
"Raiding Party."  I think "Legacies" came out very well (guest-starring John
Vickery).  "Raiding Party" will guest star Gerrit Graham.

     We finally delivered "Chrysalis" to Warner/PTEN, and heard back: our
liaison over there was stunned, describes it as the best season-ending
cliffhanger he's ever seen, unlike anything done before.  Suffice to say we're
pleased.

     There's not a lot of CGI in either "Legacies" or "The Quality of Mercy"
(which will follow "Raiding Party" in the production lineup), because neither
story really called for it.  But there's a *lot* in "Raiding Party," some of
it very elaborate.  By way of comparison, in an average B5 episode, a script
from beginning to end has about 60 or 70 setups (a setup is a numbered scene
or shot, i.e., INT. SCOCKPIT or INT. ZEN GARDEN).  "Raiding Party" has around
112 setups.  That's more than in some movies.  It's a *very* busy script.

     We're now just about two weeks from our debut.  Lots of behind the scenes
action...meeting with journalists and some critics, buckets of interviews, and
a general sense of *anticipation* among the crew.  People are now either
seeing, or about to see what we've been quietly doing here ever since July.

     Once "Babylon Squared" is turned in, probably on Friday or Monday, there
will be just 4 scripts left to write (of which 2 are the two-parter).
 It seems like just yesterday we had 22 in front of us to write.  The time has
just zipped past with unparalleled speed.  It feels like it took forever to
GET the series, and suddenly before we really have a chance to think about it,
ZOOM, the first season is nearly over.

     This is going to be a very interesting few months....

                                                                 jms

     No studio in its right mind would give a second season go without getting
in a fair number of ratings nights first to determine whether or not it's a
viable show.  Not every good show gets amazing ratings, and not every crummy
show fails....

                                                                    jms

     On the topic of B5 being a novel for television, consisting basically of
five "books" (as Lord of the Rings was three books)...some figures for your
consideration.

     The total page number of script pages for season one: 1,100 (give or take
about 10-20 pages).  Basically two 550 page novels, or one very long (275,000
words) novel.

     At this point, it looks like the total for season one scripts written by
JMS is 12 scripts, or a total of about 600 pages (equal to a 150,000 word
novel).

     Assuming the show runs 5 years, that's 5,500 pages, equal to 11 average-
sized (100,000 words) novels.  Given that I'll probably continue to write
about half the scripts, that's 2,500 pages/5.5 novels just in JMS scripts.

     (Why do I suddenly feel very tired...?)

     Yes, this is the actual text of a script.  And a script contains scene
descriptions, dialogue, directions.  (Contrary to popular opinion, the actors
don't just make up their lines when they hit the stage, based on loose ideas
by somebody.)  My scripts tend to be *very* detailed, with camera movement
suggestions, optical notes, indications of dissolves vs. cuts, on and on.  A
typical scene might look like this:

EXT. BABYLON 5 - ESTABLISHING

A scuttleship unloads cargo from a transport parked alongside the station.
PAN ACROSS with the scuttleship, tracking with it until it passes into the
docking bay, then DOWN TO the observation dome window, where we can just see
into

INT. OBSERVATION DOME

where Lieutenant-Commander IVANOVA stands at the console, cup in hand, staring
bleakly out into the starscape as SINCLAIR comes up alongside.

                             IVANOVA
                  I hate mornings...I've always had a
                  hard time getting up when it's dark
                  outside.

                             SINCLAIR
                  We're in space.  It's always dark
                  outside.

                             IVANOVA
                        (forlornly)
                  I know...I know....

     (That, by the way, is a slight re-do of an actual shot from "Raiding
Party.")

     A script page, single-spaced, works out to about the same wordage as a
double-spaced prose fiction page, about 225-250 words per.

     On this whole "costs less = not as good" question, the one thing that
galls me is the knowledge, accumulated through 120+ produced TV episodes, that
30% *or more* of any show's budget is wasted.  It comes because you don't get
a script until maybe 3-4 days before you have to shoot, and everybody works
round the clock, ringing in double- and  triple-overtime on EFX, costumes,
sets, you name it.  So items that should by all rights cost maybe $150,000 end
up costing you $300,000 or more.

     In B5, we're generally 3-5 scripts ahead of ourselves at any one moment.
Directors and crew get their scripts *weeks* before we have to shoot.  And
even earlier than that, because I know what's coming down the road for the
whole season, I can give someone literally *months* of advance warning on
major EFX, or set requirements.  As a result of all this, items that normally
cost $150,000 either cost exactly that, or we actually end up *saving* a
little money.

     A lot of television production is absolutely irresponsible.  That we are
penalized in the press for acting responsibly is something that I just can't
figure....

     Sci-Fi Buzz was on the set this week, in fact, and did some quick
interviews with cast, me, and Harlan (who is returning to Sci-Fi Buzz as
commentator).  More on this when I get a date.

     Yes, much to my chagrin, I'm in the Making Of piece.  I hate me on
camera.  I get twitchy, my head disappears into my neck, my neck disappears
altogether, I suddenly gain about 20 pounds, and I look for all the world like
some kind of demented, myopic turtle.

     And yes, Bill Mumy is also in "Mercy," but has no scenes with June.

     Actually, there are newer black leather B5 jackets, which we made up for
cast and crew for Christmas, as a gift.  They're *gorgeous* black leather-and-
cloth letterman jackets, with a slightly redone B5 logo on the back (better
metallic thread for the sunburst, some other minor variations).  Mine has
something a little extra: the patches worn on the uniforms of those who fought
at the Battle of the Line.  A Starfury patch on the left arm, squadron
name/number on the right arm, EA Command  Patch with name on the left breast,
Earthforce Off Worlds patch on the right breast.  Very, very cool.

     BTW, a request for a favor: reviews are going to be coming out this week
on our first episode.  I know they're slated to appear in People,
Entertainment Weekly, and TV Guide.  (Apparently Jarvis will be doing a
review, about which he would only say to some people, "It's *brief*," which
sounds like another hatchet job in the offing.)  I know that the East Coast
gets deliveries of these magazines a few days before they arrive here on the
West Coast.  If anyone sees these (or other) reviews prior to Tuesday, lemme
know, and post as much as you can from it.  Thanks.

     Re: the PPG firing...we talked to some high-IQ types about how a plasma-
firing weapon might work.  There would be superheated bursts, some marginal
escape of the gases used, and it would burn through the air, creating a small
thunderclap-like sound.  So this is what we did.

     BTW...since we've been discussing script stuff here, a little bonus: from
1990-1991, I wrote a new 4-hour "V" miniseries, entitled "Rebirth."   It was
to be the comeback for the V series, until they realized that the show -- like
its predecessor -- would be too expensive to produce for syndication.  This is
the only official, Warners-sanctioned follow-up to the V series, even though
the script wasn't produced.

     I've gone ahead and uploaded the first three acts of that miniseries to
the SFTV library, file #893.  For those who followed the V story, you might
find this of some interest....

     Logging on from the computer at work.  Still no power at home, so my
system there is dead.  So this'll be brief.  Terrible couple nights,
especially the Sunday, when the big one hit.  Lights out, blind terror, the
sound of plaster tearing and glass breaking and objects flying through the
room.  The house shaking as though in the maw of a large, terrible animal.
Fireplace fell down in the den, will probably have to rebuild the whole
fireplace.  Sundeck/patio is now separated from the house.  Massive cracks
elsewhere.  Dust and grit over everything.  To enter a room you have to clear
a path through debris...cd's, books, magazines, videotapes, everything's off
the shelves and on the floor, 6-12" deep.  Couldn't even open the office door,
blocked by debris.

     Fortunately, no injuries here or in the B5 crew/cast.  Andreas' house
took a major pounding, might be a total loss, we'll have to see.   Our
cinematographer (the same one who escaped the fire by inches) is in similar
straits.  We offered cast and crew the chance to stay home, but everyone
wanted to come in to work, get back on the horse again, show their support for
the show.

     More as I'm able.

      Well, the ratings are starting to come in.  We won't know the full
 story on the ratings until next week, because syndication doesn't work
 quite the same as network shows.  Some places are yet to air the first
 episode, and as with the ST shows, you add both airings to get a
 cumulative total.

      That said...we have some ratings/shares from the first night's
 single airings.  (By comparison, and I pass this along only as a
 benchmark, the ST shows generally get around an 8 or 9 rating and about
 an 11 share.  That's the *cumulative* rating, not a single-night rating.)

      So when you consider the following numbers, realize that they're
 not complete, and will increase maybe another 30% after the second
 airing (give or take).

      New York: 7.2 rating, 10 share.
      Los Angeles: 12 rating/17 share.
      San Francisco: 7.4 rating, 11 share
      Washington DC: 7.7 rating, 11 share
      Seattle: 10.4 rating, 16 share
      Minneapolis: 7.1 rating, 11 share
      Orlando: 8.8 rating, 16 share
      San Diego: 9 rating, 15 share
      Portland OR: 9.6 rating, 14 share
      Kansas City: 9.4 rating, 13 share

      In many markets, we beat in one night what it takes the ST shows
 two showings to pull, ratings-wise.  In many markets we beat network
 shows.  The LA showing beat "Beverly Hills 90210."  In some places, the
 ratings shot up 220% over what they normally get in that time period.

      Translation: we're not a success.

      We're a bona fide *hit*.

      Most significant of all are the quarter-hour breakdowns.  All the
 PR in the world might get you to tune into a show, but PR won't *keep*
 you there.  If the audience finds the show uninteresting, the numbers
 will fall each quarter hour.

      Practically across the board, the ratings either built or didn't
 change by quarter hours.

      To say that the people at Warner Bros./PTEN are stunned would be
 a considerable oversimplification.

      We did it.  Now the interesting thing will be to see if we can
 sustain it.  Onward and upward....

     The darkness is caused by a shadow from the huge blast doors on either
side of the central docking bay.  Because of its position relative to the sun,
you're *always* going to get a shadow there.  We could've done the effect with
or without the shadow.

     By the way, if anyone's curious, here's how I'd rank the first six
episodes in terms of my own personal preference, from 1-6: "The Parliament of
Dreams," "Mind War," "Soul Hunter," "Born to the Purple," "Midnight on the
Firing Line," and "Infection."  We'll see how close this coincides with your
own reactions.

     Our other directors are terrific.  There's Bruce Seth Green, who's done
an awful lot of work on various series (I think he also did some episodes of
V, btw), Jim Johnston, Janet Greek and Deborah Navarra (the first episode for
Deborah is coming up in the rotation soon).  I don't have their credits in
front of me, though I know Deborah's done a lot of Homefronts, and Janet comes
from a mainstream directing career, though she's an SF fan herself.  (Janet's
directing/has directed "And the Sky Full of Stars," "Chrysalis," "Raiding
Party," and our two-parter.  She's absolutely amazing.)

     Jim's done "Survivors," "Soul Hunter," "By Any Means Necessary," and will
likely do "Babylon Squared."  Bruce has done "Born to the Purple," "Mind War,"
and "Legacies" so far.

     Of course there's going to be some element of recoil sometimes when the
fighters fire at someone (more noticeable at some speeds than others, and at
some angles more than others).  Still trying to hew close to reality....

      My problem is that I have little or no interest in defending B5 as good
SF to anyone.  I think his definition is arbitrary.  Ray Bradbury said that
good SF is whatever one points to and says that's good SF.  It seems to me
that those most interested in defining SF are the ones who most profit from,
and hew to, their own definitions.  It's as inherently silly a discussion as
the folks from the War of the Worlds series insisting that their show was NOT
a science fiction series (excuse me? aliens, and starships, and interplanetary
warfare, and it's NOT an SF series?).

     Re: not hearing thundering explosions...that's because there's no sound
in space.  We're trying to take a more *science* fiction approach to the show.
Along with the neat dynamics of motion in space, there has to be the
correlation in terms of how explosions are presented if the science is to have
any integrity.  Just an explanation for why a thing was done...in other shows,
in internal-station stuff, you'll get *plenty* on the sub-woofer.

     There was a whole discussion about this over in Internet, and maybe
someone can grab that thread and put it all in here...suffice to say for now
that Psi Corps telepaths are ****NOT**** allowed to scan defendants in any
official way connected to a criminal act.  It violates the right  to due
process.  Even if requested, it's simply not allowed.  You do NOT want to even
open the door a *crack* in letting a government-regulated agency begin making
determinations about who is and isn't guilty of a crime.  That way lies
dictatorship, Thought Police and Big Brother.

     We'll get more into this question in an episode entitled "The Quality of
Mercy."

     1) The markings are on top of the starfuries, not beneath.  The
"disappearances" you refer to are shots in which we're looking UP at the
fighters.

     2) Re: the Psi Corps...let's have a moment of logic for a moment.   Does
anyone here think that the Judicial System will, for a *moment*, let another
government agency come into their courts with pronouncements of guilt or
innocence?  Lawyers wouldn't have it, judges wouldn't have it, the Supreme
Court would rule against it.  Also, please remember that the Corps is viewed
with some measure of suspicion by the rest of the government.  As you'll see
in the course of the series.  They aren't perceived automatically as the Good
Guys.

     You MUST set up checks and balances, and policies.  You can't say,
"Okay, a telepath can scan sometimes, but not others, with some people, but
not others."  The law is a defined creature.  A telepath *may not* scan
someone accused of a crime, and have that as admissible evidence.  A telepath
*may* scan a victim who is unable to remember the events of a crime,
BUT...that is not admissible in its own terms, it must then be bolstered with
actual, physical evidence.  Even an eyewitness testimony can be challenged,
and hearsay evidence is open to challenge as well, there are *already*
limitations on second-party testimony.

     Allowing the Psi Corps to function within a criminal court setting is one
step removed from tyranny, and a government controlled court.  If you actually
look at the *reality* of it...it wouldn't happen.  And that is the position
we're taking with our series.  Is it debateable?  Of course it's open to
debate.  We like fostering debate.  Is everything fair?  No, it's not, just as
in life.  But as someone said (actually, the person looking on over my
shoulder as I type this), it's my show....

     It's *not* inconsistent.  There is a VAST difference between taking part
in a supervisory capacity in a business deal, and testifying in a courtroom on
a case where someone could be sent to jail for the rest of his or her natural
life.  Neither did I at any point indicate that any business use of a telepath
is useable in court.  It's something that one businessman pays for, to make
sure the other guy's on the up-and-up, not a legal thing.

     The right to privacy is a definite interest, yes...but to the courts, the
more significant issue is checks and balances, and an unwillingness to
surrender control of or influence over the judicial arm to  another government-
regulated agency with questionable military influences.

     There are many times that these and other laws may come into
conflict...and sometimes they won't be fair to all people at all times.   Our
government has a quit-smoking priority...and then goes out and underwrites
tobacco farmers.  There's an inconsitency for you.

     Generally, one pilot is "attached" to one ship, hence the individual and
matched markings.  In some cases, as in "Soul Hunter," there may not be time
to trot out your specific ship, so you grab whatever's ready.

     The Starfuries are stored in the launch bays, yes.

     Re: Sinclair getting into a fighter...there were a number of reasons for
this, one of which being he wanted a good reason to avoid being in on the
counsel vote, given his marching orders.  But more than that...I would point
out that this isn't Star Trek, and Sinclair isn't Picard; he is first and
foremost a pilot.  He loves to get into a fighter and take it out  He's a
fighter.  That's when he is most at ease.  That's what his character *is*.

     At the same time, however, there are consequences for that kind of
behavior, as you point out.  And there are deeper reasons for what he is doing
than even he want to admit.  Tell you what...table that aspect until after
you've seen the last part of "Infection," which deals *with this exact issue*.

wasn't directed as well as he might have been.  We pulled him back a lot in
later episodes.

     Here, for what it's worth, is my take regarding Londo's hair.

     I find it interesting that people can accept spots, scales, fur,
foreheads, reptiles and parasites...but not a different style of hair, used to
denote one's rank or position (as is done in some primitive societies right
here).  Look at the history of hair just around us in the last hundred or so
years...long hair, powdered wigs, crew-cuts, braids, dreadlocks, spikes,
mohawks....

     Among those I've talked to, it seems that folks from other places --
England, Europe, some from Japan -- have *zero* problem with the hair.
 It seems genuinely an American reaction.  I was talking to someone about this
earlier this evening, and the comment came back that Americans in particular
are absolutely *obsessed* with not being embarrassed, or being made fools of.
When they (we) see someone who doesn't match our view of what's the norm, we
imagine how we would feel in that position.  And to make ourselves more
secure, as in high school, we make fun of what would personally embarrass us.
When the underground/subculture of the 60s got ANY chance to express its
views, what did people focus on?  Their hair.   Sometimes other personal
traits, but usually the hair.  "Damn longhaired  freaks."

     To see *hair*, of all things, being somehow less acceptable than funny
foreheads, scales, or other aspects of alien-ness flatly astonishes me.  (It
was also pointed out to me that in the first season of the original Trek,
there was a *lot* of mail to Paramount about losing the pointy ears on Spock,
that they just looked stupid.)

     It just seems sad to me, and somehow informative, that people are unable
to see past the hair to the person.  Are we really that conservative and
ethnocentric?  I particularly feel strongly about this for Peter, who is
absolutely *out there*, taking a great risk with this character, who is doing
an amazing performance...and all people can talk about is the hair, as though
that somehow diminishes the performance.

     Amazing, really....

silver).  As 2nd, Ivanova's bar is split, half gold and half silver.  Medical

     Go toward Los Angeles, and stick the pin in about 10 miles offshore.
 If the show isn't a hit, that's where you'll find me.

     Re: magazines...I'm actively not cooperating with Starlog, so that takes
care of that venue.  There's deals in process for a comic, and for
novelizations, but I've kinda urged people not to hurry that process too much,
on the grounds of, "Let's do the *show* first, and make it as good as we can,
and *then* worry about the merchandising."  Too often people in this business
put the merchandising cart before the horse.  If we do our job right, then
there'll be plenty of all that down the road.  If not, why jump in and try to
exploit it?

     BTW, in Larry DiTillio's latest edition of the "Scripts" column, in
Writer's Digest Magazine, there's a fairly lengthy section on B5.  For those
interested in hearing some stuff from another viewpoint than mine.

     Also look for some syndicated articles to appear in newspapers over the
next week, including the Tribune News Service, and the Teledata News service,
which between them cover something like 2,500 newspapers and magazine.  Also
the Boston Globe will have a piece on B5, as will Entertainment Weekly.

     Don't know if Ron's named that ship or not; will try to remember to

     Advance word: look for a big story in Entertainment Weekly, probably
hitting the stands next week (the following week latest); stories via the
Tribune and Teledata syndicators; we got the cover in the L.A. TIMES Sunday
color TV magazine for the week we air; other newspapers will be doing the same
(specifics when and if I get them).  Expect to see pieces on CNN and Showbiz
Today over the next 2 weeks, and Starburst should have a very long piece on
the show sometime soon.

     Did we save anything for the rest of the season?  Lemme put it to you

everything done before for TV look lame...but there's stuff coming down the

     Here is the one and only thing I really have to say about critics (at
least until otherwise provoked).

     When "Lost in Space" went on the air, every critic hated it; they hated
the cast, they hated the writing, they hated the sets...they panned it
royally.  About a year later, when LiS was a big hit, and was selling magazine
covers, a lot changed.  Then "Star Trek" appeared...and was crucified by the
critics.  They hated the cast, they hated the writing, they hated the
sets...TV Guide in particular.  They roundly dismissed it as an attempt to
cash in on "Lost in Space"'s success.   Critics attacked Patrick Stewart in
TNG for being stiff and unappealing, attacked DS9 on similar grounds.....

     They *always* attack SF.  Always have, always will.  And always unfairly.

     We'll imply some of the geography in the series, but the interactive
computer program coming out soon has a map of the station, and shows where
what is in relation to everything else.  As for the fighters, they wait until
they clear the arms to launch.

     Since I sat on a panel with Niven, who said that in his view nothing good
is written for TV, and implied basically that TV writers were people who'd
sold out and were just a shade above prostitutes in the food chain, I doubt
very much that Niven would be interested in writing scripts, nor would I be
terribly much inclined to ask.

     I still plan to continue to go to cons, but probably at a somewhat
reduced level, simply due to the requirements of exec producing this show and
writing a smidge over half the episodes.  Probably hit the major cons,
WorldCon and the like.  And always, *always* ComicCon.

     Quake...ehhh.  Yeah, had some damage.  The fireplace in the living room
is now *IN* the living room...the chimney/fireplace has to come totally
down...a wall or so is going to be knocked out...there are cracks all over the
place...the sun deck is now separated from the front of the house, the stairs
leading up to the house are separated at one point... a closet is pretty much
demolished and will have to be yanked and re-done...lots of other minor
damage...couldn't get into my office for about a day because of the debris
piled up in front of the other side of the door...didn't have power from
Sunday night through Thursday, only today was told that the water's
okay...spent most of the nights writing scripts on a notebook computer by

almost entirely while down with the flu, and can literally not remember
writing any of it because of that.  Totally on autopilot, though it seems
pretty good.  (Might've been in Flemish, for all I knew.)  Also, we just cast
Gerrit Graham in "Raiding Party," which starts shooting next week, by which
time I hope to have "Babylon Squared" completed in first-draft form.

     We've re-lit and touched up the forced perspective to make it look
better.

     Also, Ron did *substantial* modifications to the B5 station itself,
making it the biggest single object to render.  It has something like (and
this is only my memory) 100 times the resolution of the station used in the
pilot, so you can get right in close for paint-scraper shots.  It's much more
detailed and substantial looking.

                                                                  jms

     Not necessarily...it may have been 100-times in resolution, or it may
have been 1000-times in resolution...actually, as I think of it (via the fog
that's in my head) I think you're right...I knew there was a 1 and some 0s
involved in it...and it was a big deal...so maybe it *was* 1,000x.

     PPG = Phased Plasma Gun, and yes, the settings work about the way you
describe.  At full settings, it burns right through the body (and you can see
this in some shots, albeit briefly and discreetly).  We also deal with the
reality of what such a weapon *does* to you...internal burns, clothes melting
into the skin, that sort of thing.  We don't get gross about it, but we try to
stay with the reality of what we're creating.

     In the "Midnight" teaser, Garibaldi mentions that Ivanova's "new here."
Also in "Midnight," Talia introduces herself to Ivanova and mentions that she
was "assigned here a few weeks ago."  In "Soul Hunter," Franklin arrives to

     My thought, at the time, was that if we play the reality of this for a
moment, probably *all* of the ambassadors have some kind of weapon, smuggled
in via diplomatic pouches.  Garibaldi and Sinclair know they're
there...question is, is it worth starting a diplomatic incident over, as long
as they're not being used?  Garibaldi is saying, in essence, "Okay, you know
it's there, and I know it's there, but now you've made a point about it.  Lose
it or hide it, or I'm going to have to charge you, and we're BOTH going to be
up to our ears in it."  If Garibaldi confiscated it, there'd be a whole
diplomatic hassle...and Londo would just have another one sent to him via
diplomatic pouch.

same as proving it.  Londo could say, "He was reading at gunpoint!"  And G'Kar
could say, "No, he wasn't."  Where do you go from there?  (And, in fact,
that's *exactly* what Londo said...only to have G'Kar deflect it.)

     Re: why Londo didn't show the clips...at this point, there's not any
question in anyone's mind about the attack taking place.  The Narns say they
were invited in to help quell internal strife.  That the events took place
isn't at issue; it's *why* and whether or not they were invited in.   (As with
Germany in WWII indicating that some places "invited" them in.)

     Had Sinclair shown the evidence, it probably would've just hardened
G'Kar.  Also, most politics is back-room dealing.  You do this in public, and
you make a terrible enemy who'll strike back as soon as he has a chance.  Let
him have his dignity, save face, BUT get what you want, and there's room to
maneuver in future.  It's the difference between being a punch'em-out hero,
and someone who has to be diplomatic, within limits.

     Which episodes are central to the story arc?  I'd say the episodes that
you should keep in that regard would be "Soul Hunter," "The Parliament of
Dreams," "Mind War," "And the Sky Full of Stars," "Babylon Squared,"
"Chrysalis," and maybe "Legacies" and the two-parter, "A Voice in the
Wilderness."

     Yeah, the Sea Witch is the one that rotates and fires at one of the
Raiders.  It's a woman's face in a green and blue background.

     There is some history there with Sinclair's father, but I'm not getting
into it this season because there are some other family issues involving our
characters that I want to delve into initially, and I don't want to step in
the same stream too many times, as it were.

     No, nothing autobiographical in it.

     Vir calms down.  Trust me.

     He even manages to nail Londo from time to time...as he does when Londo
suffers a rather nasty hangover in "Born to the Purple."

     No, just two: reddish/orange (red shift) when entering a gate, and blue
(blue shift) for emerging.

     No, the Takashima character did not have a problem with the Psi Corps.
This would have been part of a different thread.

     When Doug and I, to simplify things, created a separate corporation to
handle the massive paperwork of a series.

     She was kidding.  Typical Russian humor.

     Snakes generally move slowly...until they strike.

     Re: the medical tools...we brought in a medical science consultant, who
helped us design our instruments.  His sense was that we're moving more and
more toward light as a system of treatment, non-invasive procedures, that sort
of thing.  No, there aren't anything like those devices in today's operating
rooms...but this is 250 years from now.  In any event, it *is* based on the
latest info we're getting on new science from our medical advisor.
