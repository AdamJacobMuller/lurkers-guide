     Brett: it's nothing to do with the editor.  We deliver nice, clean fades
to black.  When the show is delivered, we often get clipped by the local
stations (sometimes, we suspect, when the national spots are slugged in),
because if you clip a couple seconds here and there, you get enough time to
slip in another blipvert/promo.

     Other than GEnie...hrmmm...probably Compuserve.  As of this time, it's
the one area I tend to post about equal to GEnie; it has a decent offline
reader (Tapcis) that'll help save you lotsa dough...the science fiction media
area (sfmedtwo) has 2 areas set aside for B5 in messages and library...it's a
friendly place, absent the occasional troll, which is generally dealt with
fairly well.  Once the moderated rec arts b5 area is created, I'll be there as
well quite a bit.  In the interim, with GEnie long the unofficial home of B5
online fans, the first place that "noticed" us...I'll be here until they turn
off the lights.

     My sense was that basically Ivanova jumped onto the wrong path as she
fled...the shadows were in proximity, and she ended up briefly on their path,
which took her to the interception of the transmission.

     The one comment that I find most interesting, repeated here a few times,
is that they didn't buy the Nightwitch (as some have dubbed her) because in
her address to the Nightwatch, she was not exactly what you might call subtle,
and thus nobody'd believe her, and see her for what she was.

     I find it interesting because we always think we're smarter than that,
when history proves *exactly* the opposite.  The Big Lie, spoken not just
openly, but loudly, firmly and with conviction, has been one of the most
successful tactics in history.  When Hitler and Goebbels stood before a crowd
and blamed jews for destroying society, circulated pamphlets with ugly
cariacatures, indicated that they weren't *really* human (this in actual
newsreels provided to the medical profession members charged with eliminating
"mental defectives and jews")...when Joseph McCarthy stood up in front of the
nation waving a list of names of commies in the state department, the
military, congress, showbiz, and the sciences...the public didn't suddenly
wake up, hear the voice of the fanatic, and say, "Hey, this guy's nuts!"  

     They bought it.  Because they were primed to believe it.  Because they
wanted to believe it.  Because they were afraid *not* to believe it.   No, she
wasn't subtle.  Because there's a time for subtlety, and there's a time to
perform grandly for your hand-picked audience and go for the Big Lie.  If she
were addressing a larger audience, she might softpedal her message.  To the
Nightwatch, she's got to hammer them, just as the Hitler Youth were hammered,
as the Anti-Communist Youth meetings were hammered about the Red Peril, as
Croatian or Serbian soldiers were hammered about the need to rape women of the
other "race" to make the resultant babies more ethnically pure...which
happened.

     Most of her dialogue was paraphrased from actual speeches given over the
decades, or longer, by fanatical leaders to their followers.  There's bits of
Hitler, of Goerring, of Goebbels...bits of McCarthy, bits of Stalin, bits of
Pat Buchanan and Rep. Dornan.  

     Because people fell for it.  It did work

     It does work.

     And it will *continue* to work...for as long as people think that THEY
would NEVER fall for such a thing....

                                                                       jms

     We're negotiating to try and maybe get some episodes on in March or early
April.

     We like to vary the music on the bumper.  Just for the hell of it.   And
sometimes (often, actually) to match the music in the bumper to the tone of
the episode.  We have, I think 4 or 5 variations.  Congrats, you're the first
to notice this.  

     You'll see Walter again this season after "Dust," and I'm trying to work
in one more before the end of the season, but it's tough, given what's been
going on in the latter half of 2260.

                                                                    jms

      Why didn't we do the music change in the end credits at the very start
of the season, you ask?  Why, what a silly question, it was all planned, all
intentional, it means...er...it means....

      It means we *forgot*.  More correctly, *I* forgot.  We were all so busy
getting the new main titles done, we just kinda forgot about it until the
first mix...and then we sorta looked around and said, "....oops."

      Well, Mike, then you're bound to be disppointed because one of those
things is going to be dealt with for sure.  Some things can get by without
resolution; some things can't.  Otherwise people get frustrated because
nothing means anything, it's just random threads, and you get Twin Peaks.  
(And then they turn around and, because you didn't resolve something, say it's
a "plot hole" and gig you for bad writing).  

                                                                  jms

     Never said they're all convinced of it.  Just as all Germans weren't
convined of the views advanced by Hitler.

     You don't need all of them.  You just need *enough* of them.

     Preferably, enough of them with guns.

     Remember, too, that we just came out of the Earth/Minbari War about ten
years ago, when we stood at the edge of extinction.  The threat of a new alien
race makes a good device.

                                                                      jms
