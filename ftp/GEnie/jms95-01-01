     Re: on-air stuff...honest to Kosh, folks, I'm not saying that to be
convinced otherwise, not trolling for rebuttals, my job here is to talk
straight with you.  Radio, I'm okay on; typing online, ditto.  But put me on
TeeVee, and it all goes straight to hell.  I'm convinced that every time I go
on, millions of little old lady fans of America's Most Wanted suddenly point
at the screen and start screaming, "THAT'S HIM!  THAT'S THE ONE!"

     Re: the Tom Skerrit TZ episode of mine...ehhh...that was done when I was
on freelancer basis, and had no control to what happened to it after it was
turned in.  I'd written it with a moral point to the story -- that the father
was doing to the son what was done to *him* when he was a kid, being too
possessive, closing off the kid's world -- so that he would come to understand
that.

     This, to me, was the Twilight Zone.  Only after I turned it in, I
learned that Phil DeGuere (the exec producer) didn't *want* to do morality
tales because it was too Twilight Zone.  (Go ahead, explain *that* one to me.)
So they yanked out the whole *point* of the damned story, which left the rest
toothless and without point, just an excercise in wish fulfillment for the
characters.

                                                                 jms

     Which "incomplete images?"  Haven't noticed any so far.

     The TV camera is different than a live audience; the camera either loves
you, or hates you.  Cameras generally despise me, but they *love* Harlan.  Go
figure.

     BTW, Bruce Boxleitner married Melissa Gilbert on New Year's Day.

     Actually, when I saw the CNN spot, it mentioned among his credits "are
Scarecrow & Mrs. King, and Babylon 5."

     We don't generally get ratings reports broken down by competing shows,
since it varies from town to town.

     I was story editor on TZ3, and wrote about 11 of the episodes.

     So far, nobody's said boo to us from any agency that means a damn.   A
couple of watchdog organizations last year put us into the "most violent shows
on TV" top-ten, along with (get this) DS9 and Brisco County, but that's it.

     I would deep-six the show or walk off it if any pressure group tried to
change what we are, with official backing.  You cannot make with timidity a
show about courage.  I have no idea if it'll ever happen or not; I would hope
not.  On one level, if it does, it'll elevate our visibility and our ratings.
So hey, let 'em come.  And if the horse should be shot out from under us, be
assured that we will go down fighting tooth and nail.  There are only a very
few things in life that genuinely frighten me, and looking for a new job isn't
one of them.

                                                                    jms

     I do seem to recall that at some point there were discussions between
Harlan and the ST team about a City sequel, and an arc for DS9.  What Harlan
pitched had scope, and sweep, and action, and would probably have caused quite
a stir.  And the response from B&P was to go *hmmm* and to go *hrrmmm* a lot,
and wonder if this or that part could be toned down a bit, and finally the
idea just sank beneath the waves.  Harlan once described for me, in detail,
the opening teaser of what he planned for a TNG episode...and it would've
caused the hairs on the back of your neck to stand up.  A *really* good Picard
story.

     Re: winning/losing battles...on the Harry Chapin collection double CD
set, there are some interview snippets with Harry.  In one of them, he tells
this story (which I'm going to try and replicate from memory as well as I
can).  "My father always used to tell me, Harry, there's good days, and
there's bad days.  A bad day can be a day when you *won*...but you fought
other people's battles, lived other people's agendas, and at the end of the
day, there was really very little of *you* in there, and when you hit the hay,
you toss and turn, you don't settle easy.

     "A *good* day, ironically enough, can be a day when you *lost*.  But you
don't even have to say it, because you know you lived your life,  fought your
battles, dreamed your dreams.  And when you hit the hay at night, you can
sleep the sleep of the just and say 'Take me away.'"

     What's funny is that a number of Trek fans who put down B5 did so on the
basis that we used CGI, which Trek would NEVER do (and B&P reinforced this
notion in their statements).  Except of course now they ARE going to
CGI...which in some ways levels the playing field.

     (Saw this on Internet a few minutes ago...don't hurt me, I'm just the
messenger, thought it was funny..."What's the difference between a Trekkie and
a Trekker?  Trekkers like B5.")

     Seen on a local BBS echo: "B5 IN 95!"

     I'm told it's hitting the stands this week.  Some places have already got
it.

     Well, turned in the first formal draft today of "In the Shadow of
Z'ha'dum," which means there are now only five scripts remaining to be
written.  These will pretty much all be jms scripts, since the continuity on
the last five-six episodes is going to be *very* tight.  There's an awful lot
of terrain to cover in those episodes, and we really have to start cranking
things.

     It's weird to be able to look down just a ways and already be able to see
the end of the second season when we haven't even aired episode seven yet.

                                                                 jms

     Well, actually, there are various forms of "turning in a script."   First
I turn in a First Draft, which is only circulated amongst the upper tier
production staff (me, Doug, John, usually Larry, Warners, and if it has lots
of EFX, prosthetics or wardrobe, the head of whichever department is gonna get
whapped).  Out of 17 scripts to date, we have only gotten notes from Warners
on 3, all in the very first batch of episodes, mainly in terms of urging
clarity for new viewers.  Nothing since.  Nonetheless, it's pro forma to send
it along at that early stage just in case.

     Shortly thereafter, I turn in my Final Draft (the second draft in
sequence).  Usually, there's little or no difference between the First and the
Final Draft (at least on this show)...the only real distinction is that this
is the one that gets circulated to all cast, crew, support and production
staff, and casting.

     "Z'ha'dum" has only been seen by a few people at this early stage, but
folks like it.  The big one, though, is really "And Now for a Word," which has
gotten more responses from crew, cast and others than any other script to
date.  From top to bottom, everyone is absolutely excited about it.  It's
going to be a very challenging shoot, but the result, I think, will be worth
it.

                                                                    jms

     Re: G'Kar...the politial assessment is more or less correct.  The Narn
idea of an ambassador isn't just someone who SPEAKS for his people, he
REPRESENTS his people on every level. (So the strain and pressure is quite
great.)  As such, he is the highest-ranking representative on B5; he is
responsible for taking care of the ceremonies of G'Quon, was appointed by the
Kha'Ri, and can only be removed by the Kha'Ri, or by direct physical
challenge.

     Fair Use is also determined by volume of quote or re-use vs. volume of
original material.  Quoting 30 lines from a novel or reference book may not be
a problem; quoting 30 lines of a song *is* a problem, since that's probably

     The 5 was specifically designed by John Iacovelli; the purpose, though
we've rarely ever used it, was to create a moving number with the two parts
interlocking...the round o part of the 5 swings around, and stops when the L
shaped top of the 5 drops into position, locking it into place.

Every so often, I need Information.  (You won't get it!)  Technical stuff,
research or reference stuff...and given the brain trust here, I figured this
could be a useful resource from time to time.  With appreciation.

      How does one change the DMA address of a sound card?

     The card, as I recall, is a Pro Audio Spectrum.

     But on the other hand, I know many jews who are very upset when a member
of their family becomes an atheist; they say you can't be a jew and an
atheist, and that no matter what their belief system, they remain jews.  I
think there is a mix here; on the one hand, anyone can convert to Judaism,
from any ethnic background.  But certainly in the various judao-christian
scriptures there are the tribes of Israel, and rules that were set aside for
the jewish people to follow, that even Moses made the distinction between his
people and the Egyptians.  Perhaps the problem is in the use of the word
itself; is one a jew, or is one an Israelite?  One can be an Arab, or a
Palistinian, defined by location; on one level, the notion of being jewish is
without borders; so maybe Isrealite is the more technically correct term to
use in distinguishing between ethnic background and religious belief.

     Ethnic language gets misused a lot.  One of the things that makes me nuts
is when I see newsmagazines like TIME talking about "anglo" as a term for
caucasians, meaning white.  I'm sorry, but I'm not an anglo; that refers to a
very specific part of the world, as in anglo-saxon; my people come from
eastern europe.  To call all caucasians "anglo" is, to me, as offensive as
calling all hispanic people puerto ricans.  Anglo first popped up as a
derogatory term, and became legitimized.  I think one can say caucasian
(though that tends to have more european resonance, because of the mountainous
region to which it refers), white, Eastern European, or come up with some new
term.  But anglo just doesn't cut it.

                                                                    jms

     I don't believe the wire-frame is B5; I think it's an analysis of a ship
docking at that moment.
