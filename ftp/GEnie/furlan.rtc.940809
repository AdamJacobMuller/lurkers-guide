<STARR> Okay listen up.
<STARR> First, I'm going to put the room in read only.
<STARR> And we are going to do that now...Ready...?
.
Room is now in listen-only mode.

<STARR> Do not raise hands yet...
<STARR> First we will ask for you to /RAIse your hand and you'll be put in line
        to ask questions.
<STARR> We are limited to one hour due to committments.

<STARR> I will open up each individual person to say your question and there
        will be no follow-ups.
<STARR> End your sentence with GA.[ For Go Ahead.]
<STARR> Okay get on your mark ...get set...raise your hands...

<MIRA.FURLAN> Hi, everybody. Here I am. Ask me questions and I'll try to do
              my best.

<STARR> OKay go ahead Alan.

<[Alan] A.RAVITCH> Hi Mira...I'm sure I speak for all in applauding your
                   performance.

<MIRA.FURLAN> Thank you so much.

<[Alan] A.RAVITCH> Simple question, I know JMS didn't alter your voice as
                   originally planned, but is Delenn's pattern of speech your 
                   own or did you create for the character & how.   GA

<STARR> Use your Type Aheads if you got 'em.

<MIRA.FURLAN> It's a matter of acting, not a matter of technical solutions.
              The role and my own ways are intertwined, as is usual in acting.

<[Claire] C.MAIER> Hello, Mira, I really enjoy your work on B5.  Joe has told
                   us a bit about the new commander and that the Minbari didn't
                   approve him.  What does/will Delenn think of him?  ga

<MIRA.FURLAN> I think we all have to wait and see. It's to early for me to talk
              about it.  ga

<STARR> Go CJ

<[C.J.] C.LAMB> I read that you are from Yugoslavia.  Why/When did you come to
                the US and how did you get your role on B-5?

<MIRA.FURLAN> I came to the US two and a half years ago, when the war broke
              out. I auditioned for the role in New York. ga

<STARR> Go Tom

<[Tom K.] T.KNUDSEN1> Hi Mira and Goran. I hear that you and Goran have been
                      "lurking " here for a while.  What do you think of all 
                      the commentary? GA

<MIRA.FURLAN> Sometimes it's fun. Sometimes you can be very cruel. It's tough 
              to deal with criticism, of course. But, it's definitely 
              interesting, altough not always pleasant.ga

<[Megatron] P.MESSIER1> Hi Mira. Nice to meet you. Does your headpiece bother
                        you while your performing?  GA

<MIRA.FURLAN> It's definately not the most pleasant thing to wear on your head.
              But, I'm dealing with it. I see it as a task that I have to 
              endure in order to play my part. Acting is very often the 
              overcoming of obstacles. On the other hand, It helps me create 
              the character.ga

<[Michael] M.SCHWARTZ19> Hello!  I have many friends and co-workers who left or
                         fled from various countries in Eastern Europe.  On 
                         your arrival in the U.S.,what was your first 
                         impression of American culture and society?  GA

<MIRA.FURLAN> I have been in America before. I fell in love with the city of 
              New York ten years ago.But our impression was that it's TOUGH!ga

<[SHOWMAN] J.VENGROUSK1> I enjoy and admire greatly what you've done with the
                         character; Wonder and Class come across. What would 
                         you recommend for someone wanting to see some of your 
                         other work?  What about any of your husband's work? GA.

<MIRA.FURLAN> You can rent a movie called "When Father Was Away on Business", 
              that was nominated for an Oscar in 1986. Or maybe 85, I can't
              remember. That one was released on video here. Other films of 
              mine have played in Europe, but not here. My husband and I made a
              movie together, before we left. It's called "Dear Video" and it's 
              a comedy.  GA

<[Fenn] J.HUDGENS> Any chance those others will be released soon over here? Or 
                   a way we can get them? (hint) ga

<MIRA.FURLAN> The American market, as you know, is pretty closed for European 
              movies. Everything that has subtitles scares people. Maybe they 
              are just too lazy to read them. ga

<[Glo] G.PEARL2> Hi!  How much of the states have you seen so far?  And do you
                 like the city better or the country?  GA
.
<MIRA.FURLAN> I haven't seen much. I still love New York. I've just returned 
              from Nebraska, where I played in Willa Cather's "My Antonia", so 
              I saw the "wild West" (I also went to South Dakota), which amazed
              me, because for me it was always a myth, not reality. I saw that 
              cowboys are real, not just  characters from movies. That was an 
              amazing experience for me.ga

<[Kip] L.GAMACHE> My wife wants to know if you think we'll ever see a love 
                  interest for your character on the show?  She also says she 
                  never really liked Sci-Fi until she saw B-5.  As for me, I'd 
                  like to say your facial expressions are my favorite part of 
                  the Delenn character.  They are priceless!  You do a great 
                  job on them! GA

<MIRA.FURLAN> Thank you very much. It' nice to hear good things about one's 
              work. I can't say anything about my possible love interest. We 
              will all see what happens and what the future brings.ga

<[Norma] N.GOLDSMITH> Hi, Mira.  How long does it take to get the make up and 
                      prosthetics on? GA

<MIRA.FURLAN> About 3 hours. Sometimes I have to be on the set at 4am. ga

<[Phil] P.POSNER> Hi Mira - I would simply like to say how much I enjoy your 
                  work on Babylon 5. I really appreciate the depth that you 
                  have given to the character Delenn.  I also particularly like
                  the nuances of your facial expressions and body language. One
                  question: How do you like playing the mysterious and complex 
                  Delenn, compared to other parts? GA

<MIRA.FURLAN> I love playing Delenn. It's so often that female characters just 
              fulfill a function in the story, they completely depend on the 
              male characters, they don't have any power, brain or independence,
              so this is a wonderful change. I like her strength, her mystery.
              I'm enjoying it. I also come from a very, very macho culture, so 
              I'm appreciating it even more.ga

<SF-HENIGAN> Mira, Goran ,it is so nice to have you both with us. Have you 
             found that it is different in the way you act/direct here in the 
             US than from Yugoslavia/Europe?  GA

<MIRA.FURLAN> It is and it isn't different. The basics are the same, of course.
              But there are all these business things here (agents, unions, 
              etc.) that we are not used to dealing with. ga

<[Susan] S.FOX-DAVIS> What was show business like in Yugoslavia?  What sort of
                      productions were you involved with when you lived there?
                      Plus, an unrelated question.  When is your birthday?  
                      I am working on a birthday list.  <smile> GA

<MIRA.FURLAN> The market was, of course, much smaller and, also, I was a very 
              well known actress, with a lot of stage, TV and movie credits. 
              Here It's a constant fight, not only for me, but for everyone. 
              Many more elements are involved, besides the quality of one's
              work (publicists, agents, etc.)....My birthday is September 7.ga

<[Mark] M.WHITMAN10> Hi Mira. Thanks for taking the time to be with us. As an 
                     actress, which first season episode of B-5 was your 
                     favorite. And why? GA

<MIRA.FURLAN> I loved "Soul Hunter", "Legacies", the two last ones, "And the 
              Sky Full of Stars"... I loved playing with David Warner, John 
              Vikery...ga

<STARR> The last ones are Quality Of Mercy and Chrysalis.(And Babylon Squared 
        too)

<WALTS> I have heard other actors state that they are only one or two scripts 
        ahead in a series plot development.  How is it for you in B5.  And do 
        you find your fans confuse your character with you?   GA

<MIRA.FURLAN> I can't say that I know much ahead of time. That's how it works. 
              My fans probably don't recognize me when I'm outside my make-up,
              which has its good and bad sides. I try to concentrate on the 
              good sides.ga

<[Kurt] K.HARVEY> Hello to you Mira & your husband  from way out in the Pacific
                 :)   To me there seems to be a resemblance between the Minbari
                 and the Elves of folklore. Is this intentional?  GA

<MIRA.FURLAN> I wouldn't know, but there probably are many element from various
              mythologies involved in my and other alien makups on the show.ga

<[Bear] C.BRYANT3> Welcome to both of you.  How do fans in the US differ from 
                   the fans in your native country?  GA

<MIRA.FURLAN> I don't know much about fans here, except from their letters that
              are usually very sweet. But they don't bother me in the street 
              and all that, which they used to do in Yugoslavia and which I 
              hated.ga

<[Kevin] G.W.HOFFMAN> Early in the season, there was this character in Delenn's
                      room. Delenn reacted furiously. There was a glowing 
                      triangle on her forehead. I would like to know more about
                      the triangle. ga

<MIRA.FURLAN> The triangle is the sign of the Grey Council, to which Delenn 
              belongs, as you might have noticed during the last  few episodes.
              That is all I can say. GA

<[Daniel] D.KORN1> Science Fiction as a genre, both on the screen and in books,
                   has a certain uniqueness (due to the "fantastic" elements) 
                   that can't often be seen outside of the genre.  What 
                   exposure, if any, did you have to SF (screen or print, 
                   American or not) before you began casting for B5?  GA

<STARR> Next question will be the last one...   I'll open up briefly for you 
        to all say goodbye.

<MIRA.FURLAN> I did not have much exposure, but I had the basic ones. I've read
              Bradbury, Asimov, I've seen Kubrick, "Star Wars"etc. etc. ga

<[P12+] BOB-WALKER> In not knowing much ahead of time, have you ever had a 
                    script handed to you where you thought "if I had known this
                    last month, I would have played that differently"? GA

<MIRA.FURLAN> There were moments like that. But sometimes it's actually 
              interesting not to know what's ahead of you. Just like in life...

<STARR> just a moment...

<MIRA.FURLAN> I have to go now. Thank you so much for all your sweet words to
              me. it means a lot to me. Keep on watching...Love Mira.   ga

<[SHOWMAN] J.VENGROUSK1> lovely!

<[Kathy] K.COSTELLO> Thanks for being here with us Mira.

<[Kurt] K.HARVEY> Mira, thanks so much for coming here and I wish you well in 
                  your work.

                   don't be a lurker!  :)

<[Phil] P.POSNER> Thanks for being here Mira and Goran.  Hope to see you in the
                  B5 topics soon!

      background.

<[Megatron] P.MESSIER1> Goodnight Mira and Goran. Thanks for your time :)  Good
                        luck tomorrow :) (note: This RTC took place the evening

<[Tom K.] T.KNUDSEN1> Goodbye Mira and Goran.  Thank you for coming and 
                      spending some time with us.  Please feel free to post if 
                      you want to (we'll try not to be too cruel to you <G>).

                      on Babylon 5!!!!

<[Kevin] G.W.HOFFMAN> Goodbye!
                          Kevin P. Reid

<[Kip] L.GAMACHE> Mira, Could you get us, here on GEnie, a picture of you 
                  without your makeup on? I'm sure one of the staff could 
                  explain how you can get us one.  Bye!  Thank you. We think 
                  you are wonderful!

<[Claire] C.MAIER> Thanks for being with us tonight!

<SANDY.W> Thanks for coming! This has been very interesting.

<WALTS> Mira, if I may quote Frank Herbert from Chapterhouse: Dune "Seek 
        freedom and become captive of your desires.  Seek discipline and find 
        your liberty"  ...ciao

<K.MOHRING> We all had a real good time

<[C.J.] C.LAMB> Be cool, Mira  

<[Susan] S.FOX-DAVIS> Sam:  naw, but there's a hole in my head

<[Fenn] J.HUDGENS> thwap! <-Bob

<[Susan] S.FOX-DAVIS> Progesterone Sweetening?  the opposite of testosterone 
                      poisoning?

<[Dave] REPLAYER> Well, we've ALL got holes in our minds.  :)
