     "Onward" is nice...and something that had simply not occured to me.
There was one other earlier that I thought was good, and I'll have to go back
and check it out.  I hope to have the new disposition of the newsletter
announced some time after I return from WesterCon, at which I'll be doing a
full B5 presentation.

     As to the reference above to me as the Creator with a capital C... let's
keep it lower-case.  If I were the Creator with a capital C, I would have more
hair, a deeper voice, and a *much* snappier wardrobe.

     Well, if we go with that, it'd have to be ONWARD: The Official Newsletter
of Babylon 5 (or somesuch).  Still considering.

     We think we've locked down (in our own minds, at least) all but two of
our main characters.  Put their photos all up together on the wall of my
office in the B5 wing, and they look good together...a nice mix of faces,
varying age ranges, not a "pretty-boy" or bimbo in the bunch.  They all have
faces with character, the majority of them come from classical training,
Juliard or the Royal Shakespearean company...really a good bunch.  With luck,
we'll have these nailed down by sometime next week, though I won't be able to
announce anything until Warners is ready to do so...we have to coordinate this
stuff.

     Had one minor production-heart-attack today, but I think it's nothing we
can't get over.  Meanwhile, the EFX are looking better and better and better.
Next week I meet with the sound guys to start mapping out our strategies.

     And for those in the Phoenix area...the B5 presentation is scheduled for
WesterColt on Saturday at 1 p.m.

                                                                  jms

     Catherine Adair ended up with another gig, so we now have Ann Bruice, who
was tied in our decision for a costumer for the pilot, but in that case she
was busy on another project.  Now she's available, and she is doing *terrific*
work.  Just amazing stuff...her work on the Grey Council is particularly nice.

                                                                 jms

     Tim: no one's said a word about it to us, and I don't think it'll really
have an effect on us, one way or another.

                                                                jms

     Probably late summer.  We have an awful lot of time before airdate, so
there's really no rush to get the cameras running, which is nice.
