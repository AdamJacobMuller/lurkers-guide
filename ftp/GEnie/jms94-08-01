                         **** Announcement ****

     Since this information has now been released to the press, and will
already begin showing up on the news wires by the time I write this, I can now
make the following announcement.

     The new Commanding Officer for Babylon 5 will be Captain John Sheridan,
former commanding officer of the Agamemmnon, a deep space Earthforce military
cruiser, where he was stationed for the last two years.  During the
Earth/Minbari war, he scored arguably the only real victory in that war, the
destruction of the Minbar War Cruiser Black Star, and several accompanying
vessels, through slightly unconventional means.   He has been appointed to B5
over the strongly-voiced objections of the Minbari Government, which still
holds a considerable grudge over the Black Star incident.  But the President
feels strongly that the Minbari have had too much influence in B5, and that
this has to be reined in.

     Captain John Sheridan will be portrayed by the highly-regarded actor
Bruce Boxleitner, who starred in "Scarecrow and Mrs. King," such miniseries as
"East of Eden," "Till We Meet Again," "From the Dead of Night," "The Gambler
V," and has appeared in such feature films as "The Babe."  Bruce is also a
long-time SF fan, both in media and print.  He is excited about joining the
Babylon 5 team, and we're equally excited to have him.  Bruce begins filming
with our first episode, "Points of Departure," starting August 10th.

                                                                jms

surprised to receive an Inkpot Award at the SDCC banquet for the body (and
presumably the soul) of my work to date on various shows including B5.

     Well, tomorrow, at 8 a.m., filming for Season Two of BABYLON 5 begins in
earnest (minus one establisher the Monday preceding, and a shot we got a
couple months ago).  Today I saw a camera test of Bruce in his Captain's
uniform, standing in the Bazaar (a new set).  Looks great.  He has rather
reddish hair, which contrasts well with the blue (okay, teal) uniform.  The
uniform was still being sewed, and had the tailor's marks, and loose threads,
and was still being modified (we're making some small tailoring changes to
make the uniforms fit better and read better on camera, and to start
introducing some almost subliminal changes in the way you perceive the Earth
Alliance)...but it looked great, he was very much at his ease, and this was
the first frame of film shot for year two.

     The stories are shaping up to be very exciting; things are going to move
a LOT faster this season, now that we've established our universe in fair
detail.  It lets us concentrate on our characters.  Some fun titles for
you..."The Customer is Always Right," "The Very Long Night of Susan Ivanova,"
"Unnatural Selection," "A Race Through Dark Places," and others.

     It's often hard to get excited about stuff, because you're in the middle
of it all, racing from one thing to another...but I think I'm now getting a
little excited, as the reality finally sinks in.  Until the day you start
rolling film, it's all theoretical.  Now it becomes real.

     So tomorrow commences "Points of Departure."

     The ride begins again.

     I don't know what's in the TBA slot.  It was initially put in on the off-

videotapes...probably later in the Fall.

     The internet stuff is, btw, somewhat exaggerated; a bunch of people in
the same market (Cincinnati) noticed the change, and in some cases didn't get
the information right.  (They said it was being dropped, when in fact it was
being time-shifted to Saturday afternoons and Sunday late (very) evenings.)
This is nothing anywhere near serious enough to warrant anybody writing
anyone.

     Well, actually, I'm not entirely sure that that's true, that's all.
"The Quality of Mercy" is a smaller, character-based story, not a big blow-
out; in fact, it has virtually NO CGI, and no arc stuff.  It's a nice, fairly
enclosed little story.

     The problem that one encounters, given the specific kind of series we're
doing here, is that the major stories have to have every single little detail
dead right, and they're filled with zillions of little clues that only I know.
To usher a freelancer through that process would require VAST amounts more
hand-holding than on the personal stories.  And as a result, the freelancers
*prefer* to do those stories (from wha  they've told me) because they have a
LOT more latitude to pursue the story where they might like to take it; if
they do a major arc story/blowout, the parameters are MUCH more strict.

     One other aspect to all this is that big EFX stories can be hideously
expensive, unless you know exactly how to write it to avoid that.  You can
write it one way, and it stays in budget; you can write it anther way and
literally be tens of thousands of dollars over budget.  Because I work very
closely with the production people, I can turn out a first draft that is
generally spot-on, money-wise; with a freelancer, who doesn't know the
parameters, you have to *massively* overhaul the first drafts of a big story
to bring it down to something you can produce.  (Even Larry has this problem;
"Deathwalker" in particular was originally 'way beyond what we could do, and
had to be made producible.)

     Anyway, those are the reasons you generally tend to see my name on the
Blowout episodes.  But in many ways, I prefer the smaller ones, and this
coming season I'll be doing more of those.

     Re: narration...yes, the plan is to change it each year, partly because
it needn't convey the same information every year, partly because it should be
somewhat from each person's individual point of view.

     Mr. T -- force field technology is nowhere within Earth's grasp in 2258.
(In fact, I don't know for sure that ANY of our races have that particular
tech at the level you're describing.)

     Also, the second you put that up, if there were such things, then you
know the station could never be in danger...and suddenly you'd have to start
finding ways to *disable* the system, have it break down, to have any real
jeapordy.

     Besides, the jump gate is only used to save energy; any ship big enough
to pose a real threat to B5 could make its own jump point...and you can't
build a force field everywhere.

     At any given day, someone on the LA freeway can turn around and see
somebody with a gun pull up alongside.  Life is dangerous.  B5 reflects that.
The more implausible safeguards you come up with because you want a nice,
safe, riskless society, the more elaborate nonsense you have to go through to
circumvent those safeguards to have any dramatics.

     ANYONE who says that "it is easy to write an impressive speech" has never
had to write one.  And I'm sorry, but people *do* speak in blocks from time to
time and it's PART of a dialogue.  There are no monologues of the kind you
describe, Jim, which consists of one person talking alone in a room.  They are
always part of a dialogue, they ARE dialogue, period.  You seem to think that
dialogue is one sentence from A, one sentence from B, another from A.
Sometimes it is.  Sometimes it ain't.

     Londo was not alone in the room delivering a monologue about the Narns;
he was responding to a point raised by Delenn and explaining the situation.
Sometimes that takes more than one sentence.  As far as I can remember, I
don't think I've ever had a conversation in my entire life where nobody ever
said more than three sentences at one time.  You sometimes have to break in,
"Let me get in a word in edgewise here."

     That is PART of dialogue.  You may not like it.  That's your business.
 But if you say it's not dialogue, I'm sorry, but you're simply, flatly and
irredeemably wrong.

                                                                 jms

     They haven't built 5 Babylon stations.  The first three were
sabotaged/damaged during the *very* early stages of construction; they never
got very far with them, so the cost was minimal.  Only #4 was completed, very
expensive.  When that vanished, they decided to scrimp and (with Minbari
additional funding) built a half-assed B5; there will never be a B6.

     Yes, in 7 days, we see B4.

     (Do I live to please, or what?)

     Had two Susan russianisms in the two-parter, they slipped past; I
generally keep them more distinct.  I don't think there are any more for the
rest of the season.

     RE: similarity in initials...well, a creator has to take some liberties
in character identification....

     RE: casting Boxleitner and differences in how the character fits in...he
fits tighter into the events of year two than Sinclair would have, in terms of
being on B5, due to the desire to increase some of the tension on-station.
The questin of who you can really trust starts to take on weight next season.
Also, Sinclair's place of relocation will allow us to bring in some new
elements that you'll start spotting about mid-season (we'll see who notices
them first; they'll be in the background to start, then move forward).  And,
again, we can broaden out the storyline.

     A *lot* of people were considered for this role...because you have to
look at all of the possibilities, and from there find the one person most
suited to your show.  Some of the other people who were on the list were
Anthony Andrews, James Earl Jones, Roger Reece, A. Martinez...but the one name
that really kept coming to the top of the list, who both Doug and I wanted the
most, was Bruce.  He has all the right attributes for the character, and Doug
has worked with him before, knowing him to be a nifty guy...good with people,
a hard worker, a team player, dedicated to his craft and his show...good,
decent, honorable people are sometimes hard to find, but Bruce has all of
those qualities and more.  We spent a couple of hours the other day just
hanging out in the B5 offices, talking SF (he'd just finished reading Harry
Turtledove's newest Civil War book, and had started on another...he's a big
fan of 50s SF as well as such films as Blade Runner, vastly preferring the
director's cut) and fighter aircraft (he's a buff and collector of aircraft
memorabilia, and has flown just about every kind of plane)...had a great time.

     He really complements the show because, like those of us who man the
other areas, he really is a stone SF fan.  (His kids in particular REALLY
wanted him to do the show.)  He's watched B5 and likes it a lot.

     I think you're gonna like him a *lot*.

                                                                   jms

     My thought was always that big ships have interceptors to take out
incoming fire, and other kinds of weaponry to deflect or knock asice (aside)
other incoming fire.  The key is to overload the defense system so that some
things get through (and the enemy ship did take some pretty heavy hits at
various points).

     Ben: thanks.  For what it's worth...I tend to write *very* tightly; I
don't like to leave things hanging, and I don't like threads that don't get
resolved.  Chekhov wrote, "If there is a gun on the wall in act one, scene
one, then you *must* use the gun by act three, scene three."  You don't put in
things you don't intend to use.  So the future stuff will all be dealt with.

     Jim: no, I'm sorry, but you're simply wrong on this.  As of the teaser in
"Voice," they knew that a world previously thought dead and uninhabited was in
fact sending out an *extremely* powerful beacon; that alone confirms the
existence of some new alien tech, probably very advanced.  As soon as that
beacon was detected, and a report filed (which was almost immediate), the
Hyperion got its orders.  Remember, Earth is obsessed with getting its hands
on new technology.  The Hyperion continued to monitor reports as it proceeded
to B5.  The Captain's line tracks.

     Please don't describe things as "improbable" or "plot contrivances"
because you haven't thought them through.  You do this frequently.

     Many journalists are, frankly, idiots and crude; they look for ways to be
cruel.  (I'm talking mainly entertainment journalists, not the real kind.)  In
talking to some who've called for interviews, they go to "so, why'd you kick
him off?" or "when did he get shoved out?" and it's so damned
infuriating...they have to find some way to make this News With An Edge, give
it some controversy, some heat, when none exists.  I hate it a lot.

     Dave...he didn't turn the set off...it was broken up by static, if you'll
go back and look, because a much stronger transmission was coming in.

     Namely, the one that appeared in his room.  If you'll note, it goes away,
THEN, puzzled, Sinclair goes to the screen to see why it's gone.

     It is, as you say, "very annoying" to be accused of a "standard TV
cliche" that in fact only happened in the viewer's memory.

     There is a middle ground here.

     The people who like to speculate do so in print because they want to see
(and be seen) if they were right or wrong; else why write it?

     You can write to a topic without ever having read it.  So why not
speculate on voice 2 *in* voice two, then after you've seen the episode, do a
REA 23 1-whatever the last number is?  This way, you don't see any spoilers
that you don't want to see, and other folks don't have to worry about it?
This is fast becoming one of those discussions over who has what *rights* when
in fact it should be about politeness.

     Draal will not get involved in such things.  The fate of B5 must be
played out without interference.  They can ask, but he will not reply.

     Most pre-War EA warships operated sans gravity, though some of the later,
larger ones used counterweight-spinning to create a tiny bit of gravity (a la
2010), but when going into battle, that is disabled to give the ship maximum
maneuverability.

     (Can't decide if it's wonderful or sad that we've worked this stuff out
to this amount of detail....you'll probably see one or more of the latter
kinds of ships next season.)

     The captain of the Hyperion specifically states that he was already IN
hyperspace, en route to another system, when he was ordered to stop here.  His
ship was already in the area.  Also, there is a fair amount of time between
the actions on the planet initially, and the arrival of the Hyperion...enough
to know there's some kind of tech there, based on the initial attacks.  The
Hyperion continued to monitor reports as they came in.

     A thought to bear in mind re: the whole Sinclair thing...I announced on
the various forums several *months* ago about the change in his role, moving
off the chessboard.  If we really were never going to see Sinclair again, one
particular shot would have been deleted from the episode; it would not have
caused us any problem since we were still messing with it anyway, and we've
certainly left things unexplained in other episodes, like "Mind War."  We
could've left the One unexplained.  We chose not to.   You can read into that
what you will.

                                                                   jms

     Cindy: on the one hand, one of the true ingredients of tragedy (or just
plain drama in some cases) is that you know something that hte (the)
characters *don't* know, and if you like the characters, and you know
something just awful may happen to them, but you don't know exactly how or
when, it adds interest, I think.

     On the other hand, 1) I've never stated that that was where Garibaldi
does (or doesn't) check out, and 2) go watch "Signs" again; there's a shuttle
seen leaving B5 instants before it explodes.  Who's on it?  We'll have to wait
and see.  Certainly, though, this would be one good prospect for a good death.
But my point is you *don't* know...so the uncertainty remains.

                                                                   jms

     Mike: it'll all hang together in the end.  If I'd wanted, if that scene
with the One revealed would've been a problem, I could've easily cut it LONG
before delivering it to PTEN, and left it a "mystery yet to be explained."  No
problem.  But I didn't.  It all still tracks.

     An interesting (one hopes) sidelight to the episode....

     This is, after all, two stories overlapping...the present story, and the
future story.  When, eventually, that future story is shown, it has to be
absolutely consistent with the events in B-squared.  So what was required,
really, was to block out two scripts...this one, and the one yet to be
written, so that the events dovetail in the right sequence.  (The best analogy
would be the last two "Back to the Future" films.)  It was kind of a bear, but
an interesting thought experiment.
