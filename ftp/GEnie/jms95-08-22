     We use the normal TV part of the frame.  And yes, Mary Jo was doing
casting for lots of other shows, including Walker, Outer Limits, and others,
as well as B5.  We felt we needed someone who could concentrate more heavily
on B5.

                                                                  jms

     The *quality* of performers was generally fine, it's the question of
diversity.  We felt we were seeing the same faces again and again over 2 years
and the pilot.  Casting directors tend to have very defined  areas of
interest.  And, again, she was working on lots of other projects.  So this
year we changed casting directors to Fern Champion (yes, that's her real name,
and she's from New York, so watch it), who's been great, and is giving us a
real breadth of actors, particularly in terms of a  wider ethnic range, which
is something I've been pushing for for two years, and never felt I was getting
as well as I'd've liked.

                                                                  jms

     Fern's mainly done a lot of feature films, but at this hour, the only one
that comes to mind is the Naked Gun movie.  But there's been a lot more than
just that.

     Currently, we're shooting an episode with Stephen Macht as guest star,
playing Na'Far, a Narn, in "A Day in the Strife."

     Dan: are you having trouble getting photos *now*?  'Cause we had a very
long talk with WB PR about this, and they said it wouldn't happen anymore.  If
it is, lemme know, and I'll beat the crap outta somebody.

     As for the rest...yes, we're hitting that point where many parts of the
media simply cannot ignore us any longer.  We're here, we're not Trek, and
you're Going To Have To Deal With Us.  If for no other reason than the readers
keep asking for coverage.  Though of those you list (Mike), about half are
British publications.  We generally get much more respect,and better coverage,
there than here.

     I haven't gotten a copy of the Foundation magazine yet; hope it came out
okay, and I don't end up looking like too much of a doofus.

     Minbar was an intentional co-opt of the term for a pulpit in a mosque;
seemed appropriate.

     Mike Cooney: not much on foreplay, are you?  

     If you pull out all your stops in the first season or two, Mike, where do
you go from there?  First time out, we saw just one shadow vessel; then we saw
two; then we saw fighters; then we saw fighters and shadow ships, three, then
four.  There's a reason for this progression, though I can't get into it now.

     If you blow everything out this early, you've got nowhere to go.  So this
is being paced logically and carefully.

     Me, I *love* foreplay.

     Changing topics for a moment....

     Episode #5, "Passing Through Gethsemane," guest stars Brad Dourif, and is
being directed by Adam Nimoy.

     Just dialed in here...demographics are a dirty word where I come from. 
Basically, I write the story that I would like to see as a viewer.  If my
tastes reflect that of others, folks watch; if not, not.  

     This is how I've always written, all the way back to when I began in
animation.  "This would be a cool story."  And that's the be-all and end-all
of it.  Same with everything else.  

     Back a few years ago, I was looking for a particular kind of horror
novel.  Couldn't quite find what I wanted.  So I sat down and *wrote* it,
wrote the novel I wanted to read.  Finished it, and shoved it in the closet
for, I think, about two years.  One day, my agent suggested I really should
write a novel someday.  Reluctantly, I dragged it out of the closet.  Gave it
to her.  She gave it to a NY editor, who sold it to the first editor who got
it.  It really wasn't written for anyone else but me; had it stayed in the
closet forever, it would've accomplished that task.  

     I take that approach with everything I write; if I wouldn't watch it, I
won't write it.  So, basically, my demographic is me.

                                                                       jms

     BTW, for those who get the British publications, there's a huge B5 story
(several, actually) in SFX...and the critical review of SF called Foundation
just published a very long piece of mine about B5, and SF in general, with a
fair amount of personal background stuff as well.

overall, it's not bad.

     The watch is one of my favorites, a Hamilton Ventura, and as a matter of
fact, there IS a story behind it.

     Each time I finish working on a series, I buy myself a little item which
becomes tied to that experience.  After finishing work on The Twilight Zone, I
was in an art deco store on Ventura Boulevard here in the valley.  I spotted
that watch, and instantly fell in love with it, the design, the unusual shape,
and had to have it.  

     As I'm buying it, the dealer mentions that this watch just came on the
market, that it's a recreation from the same parts of the first electric watch
on the market, again, the Hamilton Ventura, which came out in the late 1950s. 
This new but identical version had *just* come out a few weeks ago.

     So he's giving me the whole long history, very knowledgeable guy, and in
the course of talking, he asks what I do.  I mention that I'm a writer.  He
perks up.  See, he's been in the business a long time, and he sold this exact
same kind of watch to another TV writer, long time ago.  "Who's that?" I ask.

     "Rod Serling."

     Suffice to say I was floored.  I went home, dug through my books, and
right there in one of them -- I think it's the Joel Engle bio -- there's a
full-page shot of Rod, and you can see very clearly that the watch on his
wrist...is a Hamilton Ventura, identical to the one I'd just bought to
commemorate finishing working on The Twilight Zone.

     I still wear it, now and again, for special occasions....

                                                                  jms

     Forgot to add the final irony to all this...one of the last scripts I
wrote for The Twilight Zone was entitled "Our Selena is Dying," based on a
never-produced outline by Rod Serling.  So I did the script, based on his
outline.  So the episode has a shared credit, me and Rod.  So finding that
watch has kinda special significance.

                                                                    jms

     Yeah, it was one of a cluster of art deco stores on Ventura, but a number
of them have moved around, and I'll be damned if I can remember which one now.

     The key to the questions is that you generally have to first be able to
answer "who are you?" before you can intelligently determine "what do you
want?"  To deal right with "what do you want" before you know who you are is
destructive in almost any situation.

     We will see Lyta again.

     RE: alternate lifestyles...I said when stuff happened, we wouldn't make a
big deal out of it, it'd just be there...and I said we'd address it in our own
way, in our own time.  We've done a bit here, we'll do a bit more down the

of the story permits, not sooner, not later.  I will not allow this to become
a political football.  If you do nothing, folks yell at you for ignoring it;

for not doing it sooner.  Screw it.  I do what the story calls for, as the

     See, here's where I start to have a problem.  For starters, I don't do
any thing to be politically correct, or politically incorrect, I do what I do
in any story because that's what the story points me toward.  Anybody who says
"It's not necessary" isn't entitled to that judgement, frankly; you don't know
what's necessary to the story.  And by framing it in the  "is this NECESSARY?"
way is designed to make you defend your position when such defense isn't the
point; is it NECESSARY to have humor? to have a romance? to have correct
science?  No, *nothing* is NECESSARY.  It's what the writer feels is right for
that scene, that story, that character.  

     "Oh, well, I saw it, but was all that violence NECESSARY?"  This is,
frankly, a BS observation usually offered by someone with an agenda, who 
wishes to invalidate the notion of an artistic view and impose some kind of
quota, or objective criterion to what is and isn't necessary for a movie or
film.  As far as I'm concerned, the first person to throw this into a
discussion has, frankly, just lost the argument.

     Point the second: one of the most consistent comments I get, in email and
regular mail, is the spirituality conveyed in the show, that we have shown,
and will continue to show, tolerance toward religion, even created sympathetic
religious characters.  "Thank you for your tolerance," they say...until we
show somebody or some action THEY don't like...and at that point suddenly it's
a lot of tsk-tsking and chest thumping and disapproval; so okay, how about I
just stop all positive religious aspects of the show? 

     It seems to me, that if I do *all that* with religion, and with thje
(the) simple act of showing maybe ONE PERSON in all the long history of TV
science fiction across 40 years has a different view of life, that the show is
somehow degraded, or downgraded, or dropped in opinion...this simply
reinforces the notion, held by many, that a lot of folks in the religious
right wish to make sure no other perspective or lifestyle is ever shown on
television, at any time, unless in a negative fashion.  

     The thing of it is, while on the one hand I'm getting praise from
religious folks for addressing spirituality in my series (speaking here as an
atheist), I've gotten flack from others who think it has no place in a SCIENCE
fiction series, and why the hell am I putting something in that goes right
against my own beliefs?  "Because," I tell them, "this show is not about
reflecting my beliefs, or yours, or somebody else's, it's about telling this
story, about these people, with as much honesty and integrity as I can summon
up.  That means conceding the fact that religious people are going to be
around 260 years from now."  Well, fact is, all kinds of people are going to
be around 260 years from now.  And what did the anti-religion folks say
specifically about including spirituality in my series?  "It's not
*necessary*," they said.

     Translation: they didn't like it.  Well, tough.  It was right for this
story, and this show.  And it seems to me rather hypocritical for some folks,
who applaud the show for tolerance, for my standing up to  those who want to
exclude religion from TV, to then turn around and say the show is diminished
because it showed that same tolerance...to another group or perspective.  I
guess tolerance is only okay as long as it's pointed one way.

     You say that as a christian, you think any sex except that between a
husband and a wife to be wrong.  Well, as I recall, the bible also speaks
against murder.  We've depicted deaths by the hundreds of thousands.  (And
we're talking here about the *depicting* of the act, simply showing it, not
the value judgements made after the fact.)  Why does the one (which is so
barely hinted at as to be almost invisible) cause the show to be diminished
where the other does not?  

     My job is not to reinforce your personal political, social or religious
beliefs.  My job is not to reinforce MY personal political, social or
religious beliefs.  Then it isn't art or storytelling anymore, it's simply
propaganda.  My job is to tell this story, about these people, AS people, as
mixed and varied as they are today.  And there is no outside objective
criteria as to what is, or isn't *necessary* in a story; that is the sole
province of the author.  You may or may not like it.  You may or may not
choose to watch it.  Just as people who don't like to see religion and god
discussed on TV may dislike it or choose not to watch it.

     But you'll excuse me if I see complaints about this one little thing from
the religious side, after all I've done to present religious characters and
the religious life in a positive fashion, to be hypocritical and frankly
somewhat ungrateful.  It's as though all this means nothing because of one
thing, one outside-imposed litmus test that disregards anything and everything
else that has been done.

     So straight up...if I should stop tolerating or showing viewpoints that
are not my own (spoken as someone who is absolutely straight), then should I
now stop showing religion as well?  Because that's what this comes down to. 
Is that what you want?  Because religion is included at my discretion as well
as anything else on this show.  You want me to be less tolerant?  Just say the
word.

                                                                       jms

     Yes, we'll see both the tines being repaired, and the core shuttle being
fixed, in ep 1 of year 3.  The tines are mainly to stabalize incoming cargo
ships so they can be offloaded (something we've shown there from time to time)
into the zero-g cargo bay.

     Ken: yes, showing does not mean endorsing, showing just means saying
"this is here," not to make an issue of it.  If I'm going to start endorsing
ANYbody's POV around here, it's going to be mine, and I think we all know how
dreadful THAT would be.

     Re: Kosh...we'll see him again outside his suit in "Dust to Dust," but in
a somewhat unconventional fashion....

     As for "including controversy rather than skirting it," this is more or
less the point.  The goal here is to not have our characters or our show make
*value judgments* about what our characters do, because then you're hitting
the audience over the head with the MESSAGE.  "Believers" is a good example of
that; some came away using parts of that to argue pro and anti interference in
medical situations; ditto for "Confessions" which hit squarely on BOTH sides
of the issue (no, you can't blame morality for disease...but then, we had our
characters openly requiring blood testing, which annoys many on the other side
of the issue)....my sense is that our audience is smart enough to take the
elements we present them with, and discuss them, and come to their own
conclusions and draw their own meanings from them.  It's the part of objecting
to even *presenting* the situation that seems to me a marginal position at
best.

                                                                   jms

     We're trying to moderate the jumpgate sound a bit; it may have gotten a
bit too hot there for a while.

     As for Ivanova...remember that the core of good drama is conflict.  So
here we have a situation where a possible romantic involvement is shaping up
for her in year three.  It shouldn't be made too easy.  So you create a
situation that really hurts her deeply; she made a difficult step, got over
her distance, opened herself up, became vulnerable...and got hurt very badly
as a result.  The same thing that happened in first season, when her old flame
was discovered to be a big guy with Home Guard.

     You now have someone who's freshly hurt, who is going to be unwilling or
slow to open up again, who's now experienced every kind of relationship and
NONE of them have worked...in short, she's one exposed nerve ending, perfect
for someone now to come in who may be right, but for whom she has little time,
and is disposed not to get involved.

     Sounds a lot like my own dating history...keep them razor blades and salt
sprays a'comin.....

                                                                   jms

     What is the origin of the Human/Minbari connection?  You'll find out this
very season (year three), in no uncertain or ambiguous terms.

     Comics may sometimes provide advance information ahead of the series, but
all this is eventually covered in the show.

     Correct.  Louis was not available to use for "Twilight" for health
reasons, but we like Louis a lot, and vowed to use him in another, even better
role, at the first opportunity.  We seized it.
