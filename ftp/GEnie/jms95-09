     There's a misapprehension here; it did *not* take until August for B5 to
be renewed.  I'm trying to remember the date, but it was somewhere in June. 
We were already shooting on year three by late July, and we need 6 weeks prep
before shooting.

     Hmmm...I think the episode must be "Dust to Dust," with a quick scene
between Sheridan and a merchant...good scene.

     BTW, for those in the LA area, the comic store Phantom Zone (formerly
Outer Limits), on Ventura Boulevard half a block west of Van Nuys (tucked away
next to the Coogee Bay Cafe) has quite a few complete boxes of the B5 cards
that just came in.

Harlan Ellison has requested that I post this in places where those likely to
have ordered the forthcoming CITY ON THE EDGE OF FOREVER limited-edition
hardcover can find it.

Message begins:

Here is the answerto the question of why a three-week delay in shipping THE
CITY ON THE EDGE OF FOREVER became necessary.

A minor production glitch.

Nothing more mysterious or ominous than that.

Once the book had gone to Thomson-Shore in Dexter, Michigan for printing, and
was in production, it was discovered that more than 150 corrections to the
text--some significant, others of a niggling nature--but all troublesome to a
greater or lesser degree--had slipped past, and had not been integrated.

Tom Monteleone of Borderlands Press was out of the country.  But his concerns
for shipping on time--we've been paying the price for a premature announcement
of this title four years ago ever since that miscalculation was made--were
preeminent.  Nonetheless, because of my insistence that this book (a book of
great personal importance to me) be as close to perfect as possible, I took
the necessary action to hold the production at a pre-final stage till Tom
returned and we could get the changes made.

That has been accomplished.  Tom Monteleone has been very gracious in
accommodating my concerns, and the book is back in the tube at Thomson-Shore
right now.  Three weeks max is what Dave Raymond, Customer Services Manager,
tells us.  Three weeks and the book, a beautiful beautiful package, will be in
the hands of those who've ordered it.

It is unfortunate that Tom Monteleone's interim message on the Borderlands
Press 800-order line has been misinterpreted by some people.  All is well, and
the CITY is on its way to waiting eyes and hands.  Thank you for asking.

                                                Harlan Ellison

     Mike: my first, truest and only possible reaction to your note was to
instantly look around and wonder who the heck you were talking about.  

     "...you're starting to become an SF superstar, perhaps the biggest since
Gene Roddenberry."

     I wish I could take this as having anything whatsoever to do with me, as
far as B5 goes, but I can't.  I don't see myself or my position any different
now than 5 or 10 years ago.  I look in the mirror and half the time I see a
doofus.  The other half of the time I see someone trying desperately not to
*be* a doofus.

     The other day, I was interviwed by a reporter with a major newspaper
syndicate, and kind of the same question was asked.  What I told her, and I'll
say here, is...I just can't apply it to me.  When I go up on stage at a
convention, and there's this mass of applause...the terrible thing is, I don't
hear it.  I'm worrying about what the first thing I should say ought to be,
will it be entertaining, why on earth do these people want to see *me* fer
chrissakes...one feels like a fraud.  Because the story kinda lives outside me
somehow...it's like the sculpter who look at a block of stone and knows
there's a sculpture of a horse in there somewhere, that it was *always* there,
he just has to get a hammer and chisel and *find* it.

     There's a difference between the talent, the story, and the vessel;
sometimes the vessel thinks it *is* the talent, that it *is* the story, and
that way, I think, lies madness and an ego of monstrous proportion.   I can't
think in those terms.  I wouldn't mind, I'd probably enjoy it, I just *can't*.
When I hear applause -- and on one level, like I said, I really can't -- it's
not for me, it's for the story, for the show, for the performances, for
Christopher's terrific music.  I'm sitting here on a writing break, in a torn
up pair of jeans, a superman t-shirt, with a barely adequate cafe mocha in a
Daffy Duck mug in front of me; how seriously can I take this person?

     The guys at the local comic store know who I am -- I come in every
Wednesnday night for my weekly fix -- and it ain't no big thing.  I'm just one
more customer.  The only perk is that they set aside the comics about to sell
out so I don't miss one.  But when I walk in the door, those who might
recognize me don't seem to pay much notice, and the majority just *don't*
recognize me, because my face isn't plastered all over the place.  Which is as
it should be; the actors deserve that honor.  (This is something else the
reporter bugged me about, "The ST creators have their faces all over the
place, where in the press kit are your photos, why aren't *you* out there
visibley?"  To which the only answer is, "That ain't why I'm here."  As
Meatloaf said, "I ain't in it for the power, and I ain't in it for the wealth,
I ain't in it for the glory of anything at all, and I sure ain't in it for my
health.  But I'm in it till it's over.")

     So there's no need for any awkwardness or hesitancy, Mike.  I'm a fan,
same as you and most of the other folks around here.  Ain't nothing around
here to be intimidated by; it's just me.

                                                                    jms

     Okay, here's What Joe Believes: I don't believe in deities, heavens,
hells, spirit guides, leprechauns, or any continuance of the individual after
death.  Consciousness is an abstract, but it is finite.  When the game is
finally called on account of darkness, you don't get to come back tomorrow and
finish the game.  The work we must do, must be done today, now, or not at all.

     What I believe in is the power of the human being singular to rise above
every challenge, obstacle, tyrant and misfortune.  We are where we are because
in the evolutionary crap shoot, we were smarter, and faster, and *thought*
ourselves out of the mud (with a little help from the opposable thumb, natch).
The brass ring of consciousness has made us not only aware of our environment,
and how to control it, but has made us, when we are at our best, self-
reflective, aware of the struggle of those around us, made us conscious of the
fact that we work at our best when we work together, when individuals can
reach for the stars and pull the rest of us along with them...for company, for
pleasure, and to help the next guy leapfrog to the next star.  Given nurturing
and direction and purpose, it makes us compassionate.  

     Stunted, hindered, corrupted by circumstance or hopelessness, it makes us
into monsters.  

     I believe that we can touch greatness *now*, and that if we remove the
notion of second chances, lifes after this one, no backsies, there is the
added impetus to *achieve* it now.  (Witness those who think there's no point
in saving the redwoods because Christ is going to come back soon and the point
will be moot.  Remember James Watt's statement on that one?)   This, I
believe, is *it*.  And so we must do all we can.  For those who are raised
well, directed well, that means doing all they can to the good; for those who
fall between the cracks, that may mean something quite different.  

     But that's the way it is now anyway, really.  Religion can be used as
justification to murder, or not to murder, depending on how you approach it. 
Religion has been used to rationalize, and attack, slavery.

     For my money, religion and science came out of the same impulse, the
desire to understand who we are, and where we came from, and where we're
going, and what we're supposed to do when we get there.  Before we had the
tools to grasp the mechanics of sunlight and solstice, we cobbled up pantheons
and spirits and deities who watched over the functioning of the universe like
benign watchmakers.  With time and codification, religions began, warred,
absorbed, schism'd and sunk their hooks deep into the world around us.  Those
hooks are too deep and tied to too much of our language, our culture, ever to
be removed; they are part and parcel of our human heritage, I accept that and
welcome that element.

     But from this side of the modem...it's still just myth.  Myth with
billion dollar empires on the one hand, and myth that lives in little steepled
whiteframe churches in the Appalachias, but myth nonetheless.

     It can be myth that elevates, myth that ennobles, myth that destroys,
myth that causes war and myth that heals after war...but myth it remains. Just
like the myth of language, of art, of politics and polemics and philosophy. 
They are all the constructs we have made, the lenses we have cobbled together
through which we can see the world around us.

     That is what I think, that is what I believe.  Your mileage may vary.  I
have no desire to propagandize my personal beliefs; if you do that, they're
not personal anymore, and my job is to entertain, and to  ask questions, not
to persuade anyone to my own perspective.  In the pursuit of this story, I
will use myth and math interchangeably, whichever  tool best serves the task
most effectively.  

     If anything, I believe closest to what Delenn said, my one moment of
slippage, of letting my own attitudes creep in, that we are better than we
think, and nobler than we know; that we have the seeds of greatness within us,
and our greatest flaw is that we do not always know this as well as we should.

                                                                   jms

     Kwicker: then in the two options you present, assume the latter, that I'm
"an exceedingly better writer than I had even expected," since the other
doesn't parse for me.  I don't believe.  Not even cellularly, or
subconsciously.  If one can write Narns well, that doesn't mean one believes
they exist; why should this change for writing about beliefs?

     Tom: not a "recovering Catholic," but an ex-catholic who was never really
much of a practitioner at all...one of these twice-a-year church family types.
I had no choice going in, being born into that, and as  soon as I hit
confirmation and was told it was the sacrament of free choice, I was out of
the room so fast I doppler'd.

     Not sure there was any one particular thing that led me to where I am,
just sort of the preponderance of things.  I've read a lot of varying
scriptures -- the Bible cover-to-cover twice, the Gita, a number of Egyptian
and Judaic religious texts, less of the Koran than I'd like (some tough
slogging in there), I'm quite charmed by much of what I've read in Zen
Buddhism, I've looked into Native American, South American and African myths
and religious beliefs...and to be honest, in all of this, I've never yet "met"
a Deity that was really much nobler or better than the average person. 
They're all prone to eccentricities, fits of anger, flaws, jealousies,
illogic, pettiness, violence, inconsistency and a thousand other traits we'd
be ashamed to see in ourselves.  And I've never seen much of anything outside
to convince me that there's order in the universe...so here I am.

     Do not, btw, take this as an invitation to debate, convert, or try to
convince.  I've come to this by long and difficult roads, there's nothing you
can say to me that hasn't been said before, by others, and if I respect the
beliefs of othres enough not to try and change them, I'd ask that this same
respect be returned.  

                                                                     jms

     Lots of interesting stuff...new main title is finished and scored, with
the first two new episodes arriving in the hands of critics and reviewers this
week...finished writing script #11, "Confessions" (which title may change if I
can think up something better), which is now the exact midway point, both in
the series overall, and this season in particular...also finished writing the
first issue of a 4-part miniseries for the DC comics B5 book, which will still
come out at irregular periods, titled "The Book of the War."  

     Also got in the first volume in the next batch of Dell novels,  "Clark's
Law" by J. Mortimer, and so far it's really extremely good, I'm quite pleased.
The other two are by S. M. Stirling and Neal Barrett, Jr.  Should be getting
them in soon for review.

     The B5 AOL and WWW pages should jointly be up in the next 2 weeks.

     And in Los Angeles, B5's first new ep got a 6.5 rating with a 10 share
(very good), while DS9, an hour before, got a 5.9 rating and a 9 share.  

     Have begun shooting episode 11, "Messages From Earth," a hideously
complex episode, outmatched only by #10, "Severed Dreams," which is the single
most visually ambitious episode we've done in the three years of the show. 
It's just totally outrageous, and it'll probably kill us in sheer man-hours to
produce...but the result should drop jaws all over the place.

      You cannot prove the non-existence of something; you can only require
proof of the *existence* of something.  If I say, "There are green penguins at
the North Pole," it is not incumbent upon you to prove they're *not* there;
however you search I could always say, "Well, you missed a spot."   The burden
of proof is incumbent upon the person making the assertion.

     This is basic, critical thinking, which is often not taught in places
where it *should* be taught.  

     Quickie note on the clip-show discussion...this is starting to veer into
story suggestions, so I'd suggest a slight retreat.

      I'd be very surprised; it's finding its audience, and it isn't a bad
show.  I know it's hideously expensive -- I hear about $2 million per episode -
- and they've had a lot of problems with CGI, but all of that can be either
overcome of compensated for.  It'd be a loos. Er, loss.

     Sounds like a definite glitch; anyone else notice this on the satellite
uplink?

     Ron: yes and no.  We hadn't heard of the Bureau 13 game when we did the
episode, it was just something we came up with 'cause it sounded neat.  Later,
we found out there was a game by that name.  At which point I decided that it
wouldn't be appropriate to use that name again, and had a good conversation
with some folks at the game company about it.  There was no problem, I just
didn't want to walk on their turf intentionally or otherwise.  Logically, any
secret group is going to change its name from time to time *anyway* (it's not
like they're in the yellow pages or anything), so the organization would
remain under varying names.

     A statement is anything; everything ever written can be taken as one kind
of political statement or other.  (Often read in after the fact.)   The
question is one of political *agenda*, and that I don't have; I've fronted
episodes on every end of the political spectrum, because I'm not enough of a
follower to think *any* party, group or affiliation has the market on right
answers.

                                                                 jms

     Mr. T, Louise is correct; also, in the TOS show, that revelation was the
whole *point* of the episode, where here it's a filligree, dropped in at the
last.  It also *has* to be that character, as the flip side of the story, to
contrast with Sheridan's "holy cause" as warning, and because of his own
reflection of what Delenn might have been if she went the wrong way for the
right reasons.

     George: the mistake everyone makes is in going for somebody famous, a
celebrity.  I've done a lot of looking into this, and have spoken with a
number of other Ripperologists, and the single most likely person is one who's
name you've never heard mentioned as a suspect, but if you read the record,
his name keeps coming up again and again and again.

     To the "how much information is needed?" question, the best answer, I
think, is that every week more folks find B5 for the first time and get into
it with very little need for backgrounding.  The more you see, the more
threads you're aware are there, otherwise it's just interesting color.

                                                                     jms

     The other thing to bear in mind -- and as a video editor, you understand -
- is that by the time we've finished an episode, I've seen it maybe 15-20
times, and personally, with Copeland, edited every single frame of every
episode.  After a while, much as you like it, you just don'wanna see it no

     Yeah, it's the CP experience, and others, that kinda soured me on
merchandising a little.  I walked off CP when it looked like the sponsor was
going to get increased say in episode content.  And other shows have thrown
stuff in just so they could include it in merchandising...so I'm just a bit

     It's actually an interesting experiment in learning, in that it's
absolutely clear what the brain does...when you stop playing, your brain keeps
seeing these falling blocks every time you close your eyes, and what it's
doing is working out each possible combination, so you can react more
instinctively (yellow Ls go on the left, green Ls on the right, both top down,
to slide in)...it's really mental evolution in action, the learning process
given color and shapes.

     It's also absolutely a useless skill.

     Y'know...this is a nutty idea...maybe just ignore it...but I got wind
last year about a station in...Italy? Greece?...one or the other that went
bankrupt and shut down *literally* in the middle of airing a B5 episode.   The
next day, during the lunch time period, hundreds of protesters showed up with
placards demanding they show the rest of the episode.  This got substantial
coverage, apparently, and convinced another station to pick up the show.

     So I look around at the net, at the sharp local people who want to help,
the great graphics that are out there that can be used, the  organizational
resources on the net.....

     It's a nutty idea.

     Actually, Delenn was never told the whole situation, so she would have
had no way of knowing to stick around; also, it was something they had to do
on their own.

     The Talia "incident" is referenced again in "Dust to Dust," and possibly
one more episode in the first 11.

     None of the actors have *contracts* for five years, we have options ON
them for that period, which we can exercise at our discretion.

     Re: G'Kar's position on the council...Sheridan could have carried on, but
it would've been basically useless.  The Centauri now occupy and run Narn, and
as its conquerers call thanks to the surrender and agreement to the Centauri
terms, call the shots as far as who can legitimately speak for Narn.  Sheridan
could've kept G'Kar *in the room*, but he'd still be powerless, without
portfolio, and the whole concept of the council would be shot.  He is now
simply Citizen G'Kar, same as any other Narn.  No, Londo isn't of higher rank
in the council than Sheridan, but he speaks for the Centauri, and the Centauri
speak for Narn.

     Re: not recognizing the Centauri rule...on what basis would or could
Earth do this?  If the Narns had not agreed to total and unconditional
surrender, sure, there might be a case you could make...otherwise, one doesn't
have a leg to stand on.

     Vampyr...okay, (poink), I've now made you Babylon 5 Person here.   So how
could Sheridan "take Londo down a peg" in any manner consistent with reality? 
Yell at him?  Sure, but to what effect?  He had nothing to back it up. 
Before, in "Shadows," he had a bluff he could run; now that's not relevant
because the actions have all been taken, and there is nothing that can be done
to stop it.  Sometimes, things happen in the real world, and we'd love to see
the person taken down a peg, as you say...but sometimes actually *doing* that
in a real world situation, or a fairly rigorous fictional situation, is a
different matter.

      Vampyr: don't worry, your reaction is exactly right.  If Londo's actions
bug one, they should, because we hate to see them.  And what makes this show
strong, I think, is that we *are* very rigorous and logical in how we put
together the politics of our universe.  There aren't a lot of holes you can
point to in this one.

     Could G'Kar try and form a government in exile?  He probably could, and
they may be worried about that...so who knows what they might do...?

     A-TC: yes, Londo *does* have his moments when one almost likes him in
spite of oneself; the second episode of year three has scenes in which you
don't like him, and then you *do* like him enormously...then you don't again. 
He's caught in the scissors...and trying madly to find some way out of the
situation he's in.

     Debs: *extremely* good points, and well considered.  We go through great
pains on the lighting, to add dimension, texture, and to play with helping
create the characters.  Thanks for noticing.

     He's Centauri.  They have an accent.  He puts stress on the darndest word
sometimes.

      General Answer For What Comes Now:

      Yes, I *know* it's the East End not the West End; I looked right at my
notes when I was writing the script, and they said East and I typed West and
nobody noticed it until it went out.  I could've replaced it with a looped
line prior to first airing here, as this was found during the UK airings, but
looping never improves only diminishes the performance, and he's on-camera and
the words wouldn't match his mouth.  So I decided to let it go out this way
once for performance, and we'll correct this aspect with a loop in later
airings, even though that will somewhat lessen the performance aspect.

                                                                    jms

     Yes we have.  In the pilot and elsewhere.  It comes out engines first to
decelerate more quickly, then turns around to actually dock.

                                                                     jms

     Maybe a subtitle or caption on-screen with the words, "I'm sorry, I'm
sorry, I'm sorry."

     You can't exclude or include anything in your story just because a
character or concept has been used by others.  If we were to do that, then we
might as well never make the show, because others have shown starships and
hyperspace and aliens.  Okay, yes, others have used Jack.  But not in the same
way.  It was *right* for this show...should it not be used because others have
also used this character?  I think that the moment you begin constantly course-
correcting your show in reaction to other shows, you're dead in the water. 
You have to do what's right for *this* story, in *this* episode.  And I think
we showed a very different aspect of the character and the situation than has
been shown before.  If we just did the same old gag -- Jack comes to B5 and
begins murdering people again -- then I'd agree.  But we didn't.  I think you
have to judge a show by what's IN the show, and how well it's done, not
against what has been done in other places. 

     Otherwise we might as well throw out starships and beam weapons and
aliens and all the rest, since those have ALL been done a lot more than Jack.

     Never thought the ep was being trashed, just responding.  If one picks
nits with shows, one should also be free to pick nits on messages.   Just the
usual give and take.

     Remembered an interesting quote this afternoon: "Of course everything has
already been said.  But since no one was listening, we must begin again."

                                                                    jms

     Well, this certainly helps explain the growing popularity of Senator
Dole.  Shaving off that mustache was a definite smart move.

     Jim: never hesitate to bring something up because it's me; if we can't
discuss the issues, there's no point.

     On the question of Dole and politics in general...yeah, Bruce and Jerry
and I tend to go 'round and 'round about this stuff at our lunch gatherings. 
Sometimes for laughs, sometimes earnestly, but we generally tend to respect
the other's viewpoints.  

     I don't personally subscribe wholecloth to a liberal or conservative
agenda; I think you have to take each individual issue as it comes.  I'm pro-
choice and pro-death penalty (UNLESS one can guarantee that when a court says,
"life inprisonment," it MEANS life, not 5 years, then I flip to the other side
of the issue).  

     There are a number of interesting democrats, and a number of intersting
republicans out there.  Dole, however, strikes me as a mean, venal little man
who would make Nixon (also not high on my hit parade) look like Rebecca of
Sunnybrook Farm if he ever got into high office.   It ain't the party, it
ain't the issues (well, not entirely)...it's just that this guy worries the
hell out of me.

                                                                     jms

       "He wishes confirmation."  Any catholics in here want to comment a
little further on what that means?

       Re: Colin Powell...I'm cautiously optimistic.  One of the real dangers
is that, not knowing perhaps as much as we should about him, is that he has
the potential to become the empty vessel into which we pour all of our
expectations about what he *could* be, or what we *think* he is...and see not
him, but our own reflection, which is always appealing to a restless
population seeking the next tall rider on a horse.  

       That said...I do find much of what I've seen quite intriguing, and if
the rest is revealed to match what seems to be his personality and record, I
think I might be inclined to vote for him.

                                                                     jms
