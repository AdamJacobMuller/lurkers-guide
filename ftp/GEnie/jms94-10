     I received a lot of response, as noted above, from scientists (no less
than Freeman Dyson, for instance) who had frankly never really been ASKED
about the whole sound in space issue...and when they put their thoughts to it,
indicated that yes, there *would* be sound, of varying kinds and orders of
magnitude.  I've got it all in a big textfile, and hope to get around to
editing it for space and uploading it one of these days.

     I dunno about Chrysalis parties...mainly because whenever we've shown
anyone the episode, the usual reaction at the end is a long, prolonged stunned
silence.  Might kinda cut into the jovialities....

answered and answered until I'm blue in the face, and another new "true story"
comes out two weeks later that I have to deal with...I'll make a deal with
Warren and anybody else over there: I'll be happy to discuss this some more if
they'll give me the names and phone numbers of their last three or four
employers, so that I may inquire and find out the circumstances under which
they left THEIR last employment.  After all, by virtue of being on the nets,
which are public, and published electronically worldwide, they're public
figures as well...if they think this is fair game for others, then it should
be fair game for them as well.

     There were a lot of ganged repeats due to the fact that we went on the
air in January, and they wanted new shows to stretch to the November sweeps.
Now we're going on in November, and can last fairly easily  through to the May
sweeps with fewer reruns (not as long a stretch), so there may be some relief
here.

      So what was the (non-spoiler) reaction of the crowd at Farpoint to the
"Chrysalis" showing?

     Filming started this week on "A Race Through Dark Places," with Walter
Koenig back as Bester.  Going well.  Late next week we start shooting Peter
David's script, "Soul Mates," guest-starring Lois  Nettleton and Jane Carr as
two of Londo's wives, and Keith Sarabeca (not one of Londo's wives) (and I
think I just misspelled his name).

     Part of this discussion that intrigues me is the literalness of it.

     When you watch a cop show, and the cop fires his gun, do people really
think it makes that BOOM! sound?  Listen to a real gun; it's usually sort of a
*pop*.

     When a car screeches around the corner, does it *really* make that huge
noise?

     When someone gets punched in a TV episode, and you hear a sharp CRACK! as
fist impacts chin, do people really think it makes that sound, rather than a
kind of barely-audible fleshy *thud*?

     Is the microphone in space, is the microphone enclosed, is the microphone
a person...the microphone *isn't there*.

     Nothing in television is intended as absolute reality, even when it
aspires to that.  The most rigorous of all documentaries nonetheless must cull
quotes.  When we mix an episode, we add in footsteps (because you couldn't
hear them otherwise), we add voices in the background via walla groups that
weren't there in the first place, dub in lines that didn't exist, add the
sound of punches, add the sound of PPGs firing, enhance the sound of a punch,
add bleeps and beeps to machinery...the argument that adding sound to space
isn't real doesn't hold up because *virtually none* of the sound you hear is
real, and again virtually NONE of it is there when the microphone and camera
are present.

     It just seems odd to me to concentrate on this one issue, when in truth
the sound is false throughout *ALL* television.  Why this and not the other?

     One of the researchers I contacted at the High Altitude Observatory
stated the case very eloquently: he said that to date, *no one* has ever stuck
a microphone out into space to see what anyone could hear; and no one has ever
stuck their head out of a shuttle, minus helmet, to find out  either.  It's
*all* conjecture.  So you might as well assume there is  sound of some sort as
there isn't, until someone does the actual experiment.

     Another scientist there at the HAO, Steve Smith, PhD (plasma/
astrophysicist) wrote me saying, "Space is not empty, it's full of plasma
(ionized gas) and full of the plasma equivalent of sound waves.   Since plasma
is ionized and generally contains a magnetic field, there are a lot more types
of waves than just sound waves (usually the only form of atmospheric wave we
encounter).

     But here's a real killer: from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena,
CA, a scientist who worked on the Voyager mission noted that "probes like
Voyager do register bow-shock as they cross the speed of sound in the
interplanetary medium."

     That was *monitored* at JPL.  So if there's no sound in space...what was
that bow-shock?

     There's plenty of evidence that there IS sound in space.  How much, or
little, can't be known until experiments on this have been conducted by
researchers, and thus far this has not been done.  Until it has, there seems
nothing amiss with the direction we've taken.

     I am just intrigued at how much of a bugaboo this is in the SF community,
which swallows the BLAMMMMM! of a beat cop's .38 without ever even questioning
if it would *really* make that sound or not.

                                                                  jms

     Every so often, a screwup takes place that is so breathtakingly stupid
that it defies all logic and reason.  I just learned of one this evening, and
I'm still reeling a bit from it.  Consequently, this is address to anyone who
watched the satellite uplink of "Chrysalis" or has seen it in the US in the
last day or so.

     Once we deliver an episode, it goes to two places: Modern Video and CVC.
CVC checks an episode of any series prior to uplink to make sure it's okay.
Though they've had it for four months, they only got around to checking it the
day before uplink.  During this, they found a couple of small audio pops.  The
kind of thing that could be fixed in about five minutes.  But since it was the
evening, Modern Video decided to fix it for us...by *rebuilding the entire
episode*.

     Without calling us, notifying us, or checking with us, when we could've
easily had someone on-hand there to supervise at a moment's notice.

     Well, when they rebuilt the episode...they didn't use all the correct
footage.  Some of what was used was RAW FOOTAGE.  Example: when Londo goes to
meet someone in the Garden, there's supposed to be a great composite shot
there of the interior of the Garden area, and a hedge maze.  (The UK saw this
version of it last month.)  But when the episode was rebuilt, they used the
raw footage segment showing Londo and a partial hedge IN THE SOUNDSTAGE, where
you can see the stage wall, and the pipes, and the EXIT sign.  No composite.
Nada.

     We don't yet know what else has been included incorrectly, because we
won't see a copy until morning.  Suffice to say that this is being taken care
of *our* way overnight, and a correct version will  be sent out via satellite
in time for the Wednesday first airings in most markets, and the reruns in
those markets where it's already aired.

     At this moment, I am preternaturally calm about all this, having passed
beyond anger earlier this evening into a kind of zen state of consciousness,
utterly unable to wrap my brain around the absolute stupidity of something
like this for more than two minutes at a time.

     By morning, this will have worn off.

     I'm looking forward to it immensely.

                                                                jms

     John: yeah, you definitely should've said something; we'd never put out
something like that.  As it turns out, we discovered that there were TWO comp
shots missing (including one in DownBelow), and that's how the "to be
continued" got added in at the end.  We rousted our people out of bed and had
them at the Modern Video facility at 2:30 a.m. fixing other people's mistakes,
rebuilding the entire episode so it could be birded out this afternoon.

     BTW, for those interested, Bruce will be on Tom Snyder show tonight.

     What episodes to watch for in year two that are, variously, very
important or moderately important to the storyline....

     "Points of Departure," "Revelations," a piece of "The Geometry of
Shadows" but not all of it; portions of "The Long Dark," "GROPOS" and "A
Spider in the Web," and all of "A Race Through Dark Places" and "The Coming of
Shadows," with the latter two of critical importance.

     Losing the characters she's come to enjoy?  No.  But the characters are
changing.  That's the point, and that's been the intent from day one.   But
what's the alternative?  I've heard ST fans complain loudly and bitterly that
after 7 years of TNG being on the air, nobody's really changed, nobody's been
promoted into different ships or major changes in responsibilities...they've
had Riker as XO for seven years, which in the real military would mean his
career is *over*.

     Change is the only other option.

     The goal, from the start, was to create an overall story, but which would
also require arcs for every single major character.  They're all going
somewhere.  In many cases, that "somewhere" plays into the larger arc; in some
cases, not.  If a woman is single, then gets married, then gives birth, and
she's your friend, have you "lost her" just because she's gone through these
changes?  Of course not.  She has changed, in good or bad ways, but she's
still the same person.

                                                                  jms

     That's *exactly* what the soundtrack that Christopher has put together
sounds like...he's orchestrated music from all the episodes so that they segue
cleanly into one another, extending some, interpolating a bit here and
there...it's an hour or so of nonstop music, one big symphony.  Lovely,
absolutely lovely.

     Generally speaking, Warners/PTEN leaves us alone.  Each season, as with
all TV shows, they tend to get involved in the first couple of episodes,
giving notes and wanting to see early cuts.  Since they have more time to
become involved, they do so.  This quickly phases down; we got a fair number
of notes on the first episode of both seasons of B5; less on the second;
single note on a script or cut since about #3, and we're currently up to #10,
script-wise.

     There really wasn't/isn't time in PoD to get into the angst everyone has
over Sinclair leaving (though some of that is given to Sheridan, oddly
enough).  But it WILL get brought up in subsequent episodes, especially from

that we don't get obscure with some of the arc stuff.  Each episode HAS to be
clear to anyone coming in mid-stream, so they're helpful on that aspect.

     Hey, folks said the answers were coming too slowly, now too quickly...
what's a producer to do?

     I said, from the very beginning, that once the series got rolling, no
single primary question could be allowed to go more than about one season
before answering it, otherwise you get into a frustrating Twin Peaks situation
where *nothing* is resolved.  Basically, the events begun in "Chrysalis" bleed
over into three episodes; the Battle of the Line answers were initially only a
couple of episodes further down in my outline, about episode #3.  Making the
change, for one thing, allowed me to move that storyline forward to episode
#1, blow through it and get the story moving in year two faster, rather than
delaying further with loose threads from season one.

                                                               jms

     Klaatu...I can probably answer your question a little better after you've
seen the second episode of this season.  For now, let's just say this: in
working out the story for year two, Sinclair's main line of connection was to
the Minbari.  But the Minbari storyline was diminishing in ways connected to
the war in year two; obviously we all know what is on the upswing in year two,
certain dark forces.  I needed someone who has a connection to *that* side of
the story to personalize it, and Sheridan brings that connection to the mix,
although he doesn't know it yet.

                                                                   jms

      I believe some of the interviews for FutureQuest were performed in the
B5 central corridor.

     Re: magazines...yes, in the UK there are even some mainstream mags  and
newspapers discovering the show.  The Radio Times gave it a glowing review,
the Times called it superior, the Evening Standard called it
spiffing...Starburst has done one or two covers on the show, as has TV Zone
(to whom I gave an interview while in London).

     In the US, Cinefantastique has given it the cover twice.  Note that
Starlog has not done so once.  Personally, I won't have anything to do with
the magazine, because of their tendency to get stuff wrong, and because
they're primarily a ST/Paramount mouthpiece.  The editor there has told people
that even though they give covers to less highly rated shows like Highlander,
they'll *never* do a B5 cover because it would piss off Paramount.  And they
never have.  (Just one more reason why I won't in any way cooperate; I can't
prevent, and wouldn't try to prevent, my cast from doing so, because it's a
free country and they deserve the exposure.  I  don't think the second-rate
treatment is appropriate, personally.  Just shows you where their head is.)

     Granted there is metaphor in the construction of the B5 story, but it's
not point-for-point in any linear fashion.  The coming conflagration will look
a hell of a lot more like a cross between WW II and the breaking of the seals
in "Revelations" than Vietnam.  (Probably the Earth/Minbari War could be made
the closest approximation of Vietnam; "peace with honor" and all that.)  The
point of metaphor, I think, is not to draw a straight parallel, but to tilt
the mirror a bit, shift the focus and see how this change of perspective
illuminates reality.

comes in the door as the best actor, regardless of ethnic background, but
don't change the name.  Gives us some interesting random combinations.

     Correct: B5 is a distribution point, and many objects are stored in the
zero-G area and never brought into the station proper.

     Johanna: reality check.  If I put in all the staff (or even most of the
staff) you suggest, huge diplomatic staffs, trade envoys, political attaches,
military, etc...and did this times 5 ambassadors...even totally leaving out
the League of Non-Aligned Worlds...there wouldn't be any money left to
actually make the show.  You'd have all the cast you suggest, but no money for
film, or cameras, or crew.  Right now we have 14-16 regular and recurring
characters, and another 8 or so who appear periodically (like Lou Welch).
This is the biggest cast ever put together for an SF series, and we're
straining as it is to accommodate all of this.  To have more just to have them
is pointless, and would bankrupt the show.

     "Chrysalis" is more questions than answers; the next two episodes are
more answers than questions.

                                                                 jms

     We used the LBJ swearing-in photograph in staging that shot; odd
coincidence: the day we filmed that was the anniversary of the day that LBJ
did this in real life.  The mood on set that day was thus *very* weird.

                                                                  jms

     Phil: there *is* a parting resolution/explanation for the Sinclair
situation in the first episode of next season.

     In two episodes, you will discover: a) what happened during the 24 hours
missing from Sinclair's memory; b) why the Minbari surrendered at the Battle
of the Line; c) what Delenn has turned into; d) what G'Kar found on his
expedition; e) the fate of Garibaldi...and a bunch of other stuff.

     How's that for starters?

                                                                  jms

     That's correct.  "Chrysalis" was filmed last November, as episode #12.
We are now, for instance, shooting #8, and will again be shooting around #11
or so in November.  (We started shooting a few weeks later this year than
last.)

     I agree about the theme this year; I kinda wanted it a little on the
ominous side, something unsettling about it.  Chris did a great job.
