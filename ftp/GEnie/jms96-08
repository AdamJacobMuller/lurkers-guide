     Congrats, Tom, great news.

     RE: Electronic Arts...no, they do not have ANY rights to any B5
games whatsoever.  There was a deal in the works about 2 years ago, but it
fell through.  The area is wide open.

     Actually, the jackets you generally see me and members of the cast 
and crew wearing are *only* for those folks, who've earned them in the
trenches.  We'll never license out anything just like them, in order to 
keep them special for the crew.  We'd make a mint if we did...but that 
ain't what matters here.

     Technically, the first B5 related con I did was LosCon, where I 
screened about 15 seconds of animation for the project, and first went 
public with the name.

                                                                  jms

      Yes, in the fairly near future we'll be spending some more time
back on Mars.

      Working title for #404: "Falling Toward Apotheosis."

     Good, one should look up words, add to one's vocabulary.  Who
does this involve?  Well, we'll see.

     Yeah, I wrote the Scripts column for Writer's Digest for almost
exactly 10 years...definitely enough for a book, but since the new 
version of my writing book is coming out in October, no point to it, really.

     Actually met Chris Roberts last year, when we were in some
preliminary discussions about us doing a Wing Commander movie or 
series.   He definitely wants to be a film-maker.

     Virtually all food used is real, for health reasons.  The liquid
drunk by G'Kar and Arthur in "Avalon" is Yoo-Hoo; the mountain of stuff
Garibaldi's eating in the Zocalo in first season is piled meatloaf; the 
spaghetti and bagna cauda was real; the only problem is that no matter 
what you do, it's going to get cold after 18 takes, even with reheating, 
and by the 17th take...well, it's an ugly sight.

       Michael is generally reserved, soft-spoken, very intelligent;
he reads quite a great deal, and has a background in NY theater, so he's 
up on all kinds of plays.  He's also very observant and a good listener.  
He tends to find the one person in the line who's been shoved back, and 
go to that person the most, or to the kid in the audience.  He has a 
somewhat philosophical bent as well.

      BTW, I should mention that Patricia Tallman (aka Lyta Alexander)
is joining the cast as a regular character in year four, and will be 
included in the main title sequence.

                                                                 jms

     Zrath: you're the first person to catch the subtext in that; one
is falling toward something which is rising, therefore promising imminent
conflict.

      Actually, we put the station site online so we could run some
final tests at the site itself, and hadn't yet announced it online as being
up and ready.  That should be happening shortly, so it's still being
finalized a bit.

                                                                   jms

     Pat's said she'd like to do her own stunts, but she constitutes a
valuable commodity, and I'm not sure I want to risk that.

     Kris: no, it was an original TZ, I didn't write any remakes,
don't believe in it.

     Mike: yeah, might be impossible to do that on TV...then again,
maybe not....

     We picked our cast members because they were the best ones to
walk in the room.  Nothing much there to say.

                                                                  jms

     It's real simple, Kwick.  I sit in a chair in the office as
actors come in to audition.  Most times, an actor comes in, and an actor 
goes out.

Sometimes, on rare occasions, the actor comes in and the character
comes in with him.  You don't see the actor, you see the character.  And 
that's the one you hire.

                                                                jms

     Don: some of it's deliberate, I'm not averse to using an actor's
background to inform something in the character (i.e., Jerry's vehemently 
pro-death penalty, so I used that in Garibaldi) to add verisimilitude to 
the personality at hand.

     I have *no* idea why this should be...there's no reason why the
writers can't contact me, unless Dell is telling them not to, and if that 
is true someone at Dell is going to be tarred and feathered.  As Tim can
confirm, if someone writing the B5 DC comic had a question, they just 
sent me an email, and if I could confirm it, I would.

     Regarding Jeanne's specific story...when the spec outline came
in, I went over it with a fine-toothed comb and made notations on certain
elements to bring it into line with canon.  The script she will be 
receiving will answer about 95% of the questions in this regard.  It has 
nothing to do with kindness; when Stephen Smith needed to finish the new 
card set from Fleer, I made sure he read the final 5 scripts so he'd know 
what to include/exclude.

     With Dell, after I approve the outlines, I rarely hear from the
writers until the first draft comes in, and then I have to go over it 
with little time and try and correct it.  It'd be better if they checked 
in with me during the process but I assumed they wanted to get it out 
first, then correct what needed correcting.  If they're not being allowed 
to ask me questions, if somebody there is putting him- or herself in the 
way for reasons of controlling information or preserving authority, 
somebody's going to be in *serious* dutch.  

     I will check on this on Monday.

                                                                 jms
