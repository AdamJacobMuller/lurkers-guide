     WB will *never* let us do the marketing or promos, so it's really
a moot question.  Change of address forms should go to the fan club
address.
 
     Sorry this is short; was at con all weekend, it's nearly 3 a.m,
and I'm about to crash.

     The information on Harlan's health was *not* something that he
wanted posted publicly to the nets, and was a gross violation of his
trust by the person who did so.  While currently things are looking
good, this is a period when *rest and quiet* are necessary, and
instead they are being beseiged by telephone calls literally every 3
minutes.
 
     So all I'll say for now is that things are looking very good,
he's well on the way to recovery, and ask that anyone seeing this
please  hold back on phone calls and the like for a few days.

     No, I believe there is a reference to the narn being treated
later, and in any event, it's clear Vir wouldn't do anything to them.

     No, the ad comes out of WB's PR budget, not ours.  It's a great
ad.
