     Correct, "Soul Mates" is next up.  Then 5 or so reruns (second season
eps), then "Race."

     BTW, logging in from my notebook.  The controller on my old system (not
the nifty Dell at the office) just died, so I may not be on quite as regularly
for the next few days.

     I was kinda hoping that they'd continue the season one reruns as well,
but PTEN thinks it'd be kind of confusing to intersperse episdoes (episodes)
with two different commanding officers at the same time, and thus keep the two
separate, at least until the end of the season.

     (They add that someone seeing B2 mid-season year two might not know it's
a rerun, and not know what the hell's going on.)

     Emmy presenters are generally those who've *done* something, so that
would pretty much eliminate Jarvis.

     Internet gateway's down again...sigh....

     There's a screwup in next week's TV Guide.  The synopsis is of the
episode "A Race Through Dark Places," but it's actually Peter's "Soul Mates."

Abby, too young; also not a case of programming/rebuilding...the DECEASED is a
cover to get her out.)

     Actually, the age on Abby is fairly straightforward...Talia came to the
Psi Corps as a young child; she was assigned to an adult Psi Corps member to
help her adjust.  So Abby would be anywhere from 15-20 years older than Talia.
Or more.

     Hey, give me "A Christmas Story" or the George C. Scott version of "A
Christmas Carol" (the only definitive version of the story, as far as I'm
concerned) over IaWL, which has been seen to death.  Scott is the first and
only actor to show Scrooge with a sense of *humor* even in his earlier stage.
Look at it...anyone who could come up with a line like "every person walking
around with Merry Christmas on his lips should be boiled in pudding and buried
with a sprig of holly through his heart" (or words to that effect)...that's
*funny*.  It's very easy to see and portray Scrooge as just a one-dimensional
miser, and thus dehumanize him...Scott's portral makes him a PERSON, and thus
more interesting and involving and, oddly, likeable (until the end where he
goes soft on us, but hey, that's a story problem...).

     Actually, that 800/200 split ain't far off the truth, as I dimly recall.
Crummy with figures, good with words.

     Funny thing, sorta...see, according to most IQ tests, I come in just over
the edge on the so-called genius ("Come, Join Mensa, Join Us, Join Us...")
level.  Around 160 or so.  Which, frankly, is absolutely meaningless, except
that it helps me skate throuth stuff I have no business doing or no chance of
*really* understanding.  I come in very high on intuitive scores; I can often
figure out *what* is the correct answer, but am damned if I can tell you
*why*.

     As a kid, we moved around a lot for (let's just say this for now and let
it go at this) economic reasons.  Literally every year from birth through
about age 17 was a different house, a different city, often a different STATE.
I learned fast that if you were too smart, and showed it...you got beat up a
lot.  So at a very early stage I found I could just shave it close enough to
pass, without raising any red flags or drawing attention.  The one thing I
didn't want was to be noticed, because that usually preceded getting the
stuffings knocked out of me (and being who I am, *that* was usually followed
by my mouthing off to whoever just beat the crap out of me...at which point
they pound me again...at which point this little bump on the playground mouths
off again, at which point, well, you get the idea).

     I'd gotten pretty good at riding the line, but goofed one year in junior
high.  I screwed up my math term (no surprise there), but usually  I knew I
could ace lit classes to make up for it...except I got sick, missed several
tests and papers...and dropped beneath the line I needed to get advanced to
the next level.  So I had to attend summer school to make up the difference.

     This was under the Headstart Program of those days, and the sort of kids
you found in this one in New Jersey...Future Muggers of America founding
members.  Anyway (and this is a hell of a lot longer and more involved than
I'd intended to get), one day they said they were going to give all of us in
summer school a series of tests/evaluations to determine just where we
stood...what grade reading level, comprehension, math, that sort of thing.
Now normally I'd always held back in this stuff, but this wasn't my regular
school, I'd be going to high school after this, so what was lost?  So I just
went for it.

     A few days later the test results came in, and I got suddenly called to
the office of the head of the program.  He sat me down and said, honest to
god, "You'll forgive my langauge for a moment, but what the HELL are you DOING
here?"  Apparently for a 9th grader my language, reading, writing, and general
intelligence figures came in at approximately that of a college graduate.
(Though my math skills were, to be charitable, considerably lower.  Bargain-
basement, to be precise.)  So I told him  what I'd been doing all this time.
He sat there, slack jawed, the whole time, at the premeditation and all the
rest.  (Though I wouldn't have gotten nailed if I'd been better at some of the
other areas.)

     Later, to my chagrin, I discovered that he wrote up a memo about all this
and attached it to my transcripts, so that when I transferred to the high
school, I found myself assigned to several advanced classes in English lit and
other areas, college-prep level classes.  So I instantly went back to my old
habits, and soon enough managed to get out of that one and into a regular
class.

     Tests are fine, advanced classes are fine, but frankly, none of it was
worth getting stomped on a regular basis....

                                                                     jms

     On the two different shows/rules idea...this is something I noticed from
way back.  People saw "Earth future, spacefaring races, a major commanding
officer," and assumed that we would be just like Star Trek.   When we weren't,
many assumed we were doing Star Trek BADLY, not understanding that it's a
*different show*.  The biggest crime of this show toa lot of people is that
we're not Trek.  It's only over time that some of these folks (though not all)
have come to understand what we're doing.

     In some cases, as with the next 8 issues, I suggested the basic
storyline, and work as necessary with the writers, telling them what they need
to know on a need to know basis.

     Tom: the quibble you raise is one of the points I'm trying to make.
 You say someone from 1890 would go crazy.  I vehemently don't agree.  Go back
and read letters from the 1890s.  Heck, go read letters from 1776; the
language, the emotions, they're all very much the same.  The chrome of
technology has changed, some social styles and attitudes have changed, but
people still go through school (usually), get married, raise kids, hold jobs,
and look to a better future one day.

     Mariah was also a scientist, sent forth expecting and prepared to see new
things; this isn't the same thing as an average person just plucked out of
time.

     I think people -- Americans in particular -- over-emphasize how much
things change with time, in large measure because in a country that's only
200+ years old, we *really* don't understand what time IS here.  The Romans
who left grafitti all over parts of England are only one step removed from the
South Central taggers of today....

                                                                   jms

     Re: Ivanova and Sheridan going into the Cortez upon it being pulled into
B5...this was an Earth vessel, remember, stating it's on a mission of peace,
with a cryogenic suspension chamber in use.  There was zero perceived danger.
Also, if I were the captain of a naval vessel today, and I came across an
intact sailing vessel that went missing in the 1890s, you'd have to hold a gun
at my head to KEEP me out of that ship.   People are, by nature, curious...and
this would be a fascinating puzzle to solve.

     How weird...I hadn't ever seen any messages here, and I couldn't figure
why...just checked and for some reason it was IGNored.  Odd....

     Anyway...the production numbers (207, 208) are not for the order in which
they're aired, but the order they're PRODUCED in.  So the numbers don't
change.  We just air 208, then 207.  This is very common in TV.
