      "Target: Unknown" is a David Gerrold story that'll probably get done
next season sometime.  Ditto for "Metaphors."

     The interior of the station has the capacity for weather; there is often
a haze and mist in the Garden area, which kinda softens things a bit.

     Well, here's a date to write down: March 23rd.  That's the last day of
filming on Babylon 5: Year One.  It took us seven years to get here, and
suddenly the last day of the first season is just around the corner.

     We'll know if we get picked up around late April/May.  Look for an "eep"
if I can't say anything official.

     The weekend after we finish, we're going to take over a bowling alley for
a B5 wrap party.  Went out today and bought myself a new pair of bowling
shoes, bowling glove (with wrist support), and actually invested in a proper,
custom bowling ball.  Will practice a bit between now and the party.  Part of
this emanates from Your Executive Producer's desire not to stand there
throwing gutter balls in front of Ye Cast and Crew, and another part emanates
from the fact that I actually *enjoy* bowling, and have been waiting for an
excuse to indulge.

     (I actually used to be very good at it.  Practiced every week.  At a
bowling alley in Richardson, Texas -- and it's noted because it was part of a
bowling class, monitored by an instructor -- I actually bowled a *perfect
game*.  Just once.  All that came to an end in 1977 or so, when I got mugged
and had my hand broken in a couple places, making it both impossible and very
painful to bowl for years afterward.  I may finally try and work my way back
into it a bit.)

     Really sad...most TeeVee producers play tennis, or golf, or swim a few
laps in their olympic pool...I like bowling, and comic books, and watching
awful movies.  A man of the people.  Unfortunately, the people left town
without me, and didn't leave a forwarding address....

     We're halfway through filming the two-parter, "A Voice in the
Wilderness," which is coming along nicely.  From a CGI and sets point of view,
this is the largest and most ambitious thing we've shot yet, with more of each
category than in any other episode.  The last episode to be shot will be Larry
DiTillio's "Eyes," which is sort of a nice wrap-up to the season, almost an
overview.  Once again, nothing that happens this season is simply
forgotten...and a *lot* of it comes due in this episode.  It actually manages
to incorporate references to about 6 prior episodes without being obscure
about it.

     Even though we don't yet know about Year Two, we have to begin planning
for it on a story level.  I've begun breaking out the individual threads
that'll come up then, and have begun laying them out in terms of individual
episodes.  We'll also have a post-mortem on Year One with all departments, to
see what we did right, where we can improve, and where we can go beyond what
we did this season.  In the best of all possible worlds, as the technology
keeps changing around us and getting better, we would like to keep pace with
that and constantly upgrade for a more realistic look...and for greater
options.  How can we do *more*, and do it better?  I don't think we can *ever*
afford to get complacent, and we have to keep challenging ourselves each
season to raise the ante another notch.

      Now it's all in the hands of the Neilsens....

     No, "Eyes" is a new script unto itself.  We're retitling "Raiding Party"
(which I always figured was a working title, too prosaic) to "Signs and
Portents."  Figured it'd be nice to have one episode title per (projected)
year carrying the year-arc title.

     BTW, Compton's has signed to do a CD Rom of the Babylon 5 Universe, which
is going to be VERY comprehensive...all the alien races, including the League
of Non-aligned Worlds, background on the war, dictionaries, other reference
stuff, you name it; it'll also be able to take advantage of the latest voice-
recognition software, so you can run it exactly as the B5 computer is run.
("Computer, language search, "Satai.")  There will even be some original CG
and live-stuff shot for it.  It should be a killer CD Rom.  (Now if only I
could get my system up and running....)

     Two quickies, before I forget (again):

     1) Yes, to the pain in the butt who inquired, I bought the Quantum
bowling ball, and it probably won't bowl any better, but I'm a stooge, and
there we are.

     2) I've nudged (gently) Christy Marx about the newsletter (as has the
effervescent Katherine Lawrence) (and did you effer know her when she
effervasn't?), and Ms. Marx and Ms. Drennan are now focusing in on getting the
next issue out, which will be a double-issue, twice as big, with more
interviews, probably a schedule for the full season, and other goodies.

     Amazing what a friendly smile, a soft-spoken request, and a meat axe can
achieve....

     It's easy; hit her while she's asleep....

     BTW, we managed to track down and correct about 50% of the problems in
video and audio that took place after we'd been delivering episodes, and so
this and all subsequent episodes should look cleaner and sound a bit sharper,
staring with "War Prayer."  Anyone else noticing this?

     Also, just as an aside...was talking to someone today about how
extraordinary a cast this is in terms of sheer intelligence; Michael O'Hare
attended Harvard; Claudia is a Mensa member (genius IQ); Jerry is a financial
wizard...they're all extremely sharp people, nowhere near the stereotype so
many people have of actors.

     We'll definitely see Bester again, probably twice next season, in one
capacity or another.  (And we'll *hear* about him once more this season.)

     Re: the CD-Rom...we're planning some very cool stuff.  I've indicated on
all pending licensing deals that I don't want them to be just one more media
tie-in; they should have some independent value.  So in this case, I really
want to use it to de-mysticize what television is, and how it's produced.
Something for educational purposes.  So we'll track how the process is done,
by taking a micro-example: from concept, to a scene in a script, to costume
designs, production/set design, storyboards prosthetics, filming, editing,
scoring and mixing.  As a culmination of this, there will be 5-7 brief dailies
shosts, all from the same scene.   The job then is for the user to edit these
dailies (establishing shot, medium close-up, close-ups, inserts and the like)
into a *scene*.  You can literally see the dozens of ways you can create a
scene from the same footage.  You can then play it back, possibly with some
music, and see how it works...then play back the real scene as we did it, and
compare and contrast.

                                                                      jms

     Just a reminder to all and sundry in the LA area...our Conceptual
Consultant, Harlan Ellison, will be signing his new collaboration at Forbidden
Planet Bookstore on April 2nd from 2-4 p.m. (corner Van Nuys and Ventura,
Sherman Oaks).

     Funny aside...on Friday, my accountant and his 10 year old son came by
the set for a tour.  His son was wog-boggled by everything.  At one point in
the filming, Michael O'Hare came over and struck up a conversation with the
kid.  The kid asked what that thing is on the back of Sinclair's hand.
"That's my communications device," O'Hare said.  The kid looked chagrined,
glanced around, whispered to Michael to lean down, and explained -- to save
Michael further embarrassment in future -- that the communicator was on his
*chest*.

     I would give my soul for a photograph of Michael's face at that moment.

     The framed item is a sign for Sinclair Aircraft, a real company that goes
back to the early days of flying (we got permission to use it).

     C&C is military shorthand for Command and Control, which is the function
of the Observation Dome (sometimes thus referred to as Babylon Control).

     There are hand-holds built into the seats, and on the walls and railings.

     Will: it's very hard to answer that question without specifics; it does
make me a touch nervous, but at the same time, it doesn't seem correct or
proper to stop the kind of speculation you suggest, since the show is *bound*
to elicit such speculations by its very construction.

     I dunno...so I'll leave it to the quiet turning of your own considered
conscience.

     Re: the cast...they're simply pleased and flattered and moved by the
attention on-line.

     Re: "Sky"...my theory is to *never* assume prior knowledge of the
background info that goes into an episode.  If you never saw the pilot, you
will miss *nothing* going into "Sky" (though it'd be nice because of one
quickie flashback to know where that came from).  I don't think anyone will
have a hard time following that one.

     Re: the core shuttle...yes, the exterior was all CGI.

     For the Minbari, it's tee'la, which is a kind of poem-song, sort of.
Delenn was mainly just unfamiliar with the term.

     Yes, the two Harlan scripts are temporarily on hold, due to some health
problems earlier this season (two heart procedures), the quake and his
injuries there, and other stuff.  He has, however, served very well as our
consultant, and it has been more than worthwhile.  His health permitting, we
hope to continue the relationship in future.

     Some notes:

     "A Voice in the Wilderness" is just written by me, not me and Larry
(either part), and is directed by Janet Greek.

     "Eyes" to be directed by Jim Johnston.

     Jim did not direct "The Quality of Mercy."  It was one of our new
directors...and her name has *just* fallen out of my head this moment.   Will
post it tomorrow.

     "TKO" was directed by John Flynn.

     "Deathwalker" was directed by Bruce Seth Green.

     "Grail" and "War Prayer" directed by Richard Compton.

     (Also "Believers" was directed by Compton.)

     Overall, I'd say that "Legacies" came out better than "War Prayer,"
because Dorothy had more time to get to know the characters, and because it
was better directed.  (As a parenthetical, Larry DiTillio has developed some
of his own scripts as well, specifically "TKO" and "Eyes."  "Legacies" is the
one I'd say was developed "outside the office" in the sense of being a
freelance effort.  Everything else was either an assigned premise or done in-
house by staff.)

     This was one segment of the battle; there were others going on in other
areas as well.  It's said that no one ever *saw* the Battle of the Bulge; each
saw a small part of it.  Same here.

     Reality is, no matter how big we would've made it, more would've been
wanted.  (If anything, it seems that the more we show, the more is wanted.)
But all things considered, best to have folks wanting more than wanting
less....

     (And remember, we're managing to do all this with roughly *half* of TNG's
budget.  Give us their budget, and I'll show you ALL of the Battle of the
Line, and the ENTIRE Earth/Minbari War, PLUS all their home worlds.)

     Nonetheless, as we go deeper into the season, the CGI/action sequences do
get bigger and more detailed in many places.  In "Signs and Portents"
(formerly "Raiding Party"), you'll see three pretty good sized squadrons of
ships engaged in a very fast-paced battle that goes on for most of an act and
a half, as opposed to just a few scenes in "Sky."  Big battles weren't really
the *point* in "Sky," it was more about his REACTIONS and his personal fate.
There were a number of action/battle shots we had on hand, but decided not to
use because we didn't want to dilute the *point* of the scene.

     And as stated elsewhere...yes, you'll be seeing the Minbari war
cruiser(s) again.

seven fateful words.  As for others...there have been suspicions, but more

     Depends on what you mean by "just visiting."  If someone comes on board,
and we feature him or her, and this person just sorta wanders around without
ever interacting with our characters...I don't think that would be terribly
dramatic.  We do have some shows with people who come to see our main
characters, interact with them, and then leave again.   A basic visit.

     It was always my thought that the weight, as indicated in the narrative --
"one and a half million tons of spinning metal" -- ONLY referred to the metal,
not the vegetables or the water or the garbage.  It specifies only the metal.
And the metal is a high-resistance, very light alloy.

     Of course, you're assuming that a Centauri year is the same as our year.
The speed of light is constant...but defined by us by our own 12-month year.
For instance, in one episode, we mention that B5 is 12 of our light years from
the Narn homeworld, which is equal to about 10 of their years.

     So without knowing the Centauri year, the figures are faulty.

     There's still an *awful* lot of ground to cover in a war this big.

     Also, check the readout on Sinclair's screen as he's trying to engage the
enemy.  You'll see "negative lock" popping up.  One problem in fighting the
Minbari vessels is that they have a kind of stealth tech that makes it very
hard for our weapons to lock on.

     You'll see Garibaldi performing very seriously in "Sky," and in both
"Deathwalker" and "Survivors," the first two eps after the few reruns
following "Sky."

don't think I'm supposed to give any details yet.  It's been asked that I try
to find time to write the first novel, which is swell, but I don't know if I

     There is a side-button on the gun which arms it (the power whine you hear
when it's drawn).  It's just over the thumb.  Then the trigger is used to
discharge the built-up energy.  You can push or pull the trigger to your
heart's content if it's not armed and it won't fire.  It works as a kind of
safety; you have to do both or it won't fire.

     Re: not emitting a visible projectile, and not seeing a pulse zap across
the room...you're used to seeing "lasers" that travel at about 60 mph in most
TV SF (and some films).  When somebody fires a regular gun at someone, do you
expect to see the bullet fly across the room?  No, of course not...so why do
you expect that on something that is moving a lot FASTER than a bullet?  The
*reality* (and again, that's what we're going for here), is that you
*wouldn't* see it.  You'd hear it more than anything else, and at most see the
muzzle flash.  You're applying a TV and movie cliche which has nothing to do
with reality.

     We actually had a lot more shots we could've used to prolong the
sequence, but felt we *really* had to get to Sinclair, and go into his point
of view more.  Also we step-printed the CGI to give it a more dream-like
appearance, since we're seeing this from inside Sinclair's memory, and he
wasn't really able to *see* all this, particularly stuff happening around and
behind him, this is more his *sense* of the events of that time.  The sections
we didn't step-print were those where he was RIGHT THERE, to make a subtle
distinction.

     On the question, "Why *can't* they all be this good?" there is a very
simple answer: it's not for lack of trying.  It's been said before of
television that it's a collaborative medium.  Collaboration brings  with it a
random factor.  The script may be good, but if the director doesn't *get* it,
if the actor's having a bad day, if the continuity person lets a mis-stated
line get through, if the CGI doesn't quite cut together right...you begin to
chip away at the quality.  This happens on every single television series ever
produced.

     A while ago, in cat 18, someone observed correctly that a bad episode can
happen on any series through accident; but it's impossible to produce a *good*
episode by accident.  (Or at least highly improbable.)  And never a great one.
The job of a producer in my position is to pull the best possible elements
together, in the hope that the attrition that takes place in the course of
production doesn't diminish the whole too much.

     Thus, the good episodes are overall far more emblematic of what a series
is capable of doing than are the weaker ones.  If your best ones are so-so,
you've got a problem.  If your best ones are *good*, then you're doing okay.
On any series, if you're *lucky*, you get one-third pretty awful, one-third
good, one-third very good.  So far, in looking at all the episodes filmed so
far, I'd say half of them are *very* good, one-fourth of them are good, and
one-fourth are fair to middlin'.  That is 'WAY ahead of the odds on any show.
Particularly in a first season.

     (And even then, bear in mind that much of this is subjective.  I'm not
that keen on a few of them, but some folks considered "War Prayer," for
instance, their favorite episode.  Even at our worst, I think there is
something in every episode that will appeal strongly to someone.  Which is why
I'm a bit leery of the original question; to some people, they ARE all "that
good."  Tastes vary.  We try very hard to make sure there is something of real
value in each episode.)

     We really began this process not quite sure how far we could go, what our
limits were, how far we could push it.  So we started off kind of tentative,
getting more aggressive as we went in, in terms of story and music and EFX and
all the rest.  So you will continue to see an escalation in the episodes over
time.  It's like anything else; as we learn more, and do more, we get better
at it.  Yes, this series has been planned out for seven years...but it's like
planning a date.  You can plan to your heart's content for days or weeks or
months or years, but INVARIABLY some things don't work out when you actually
go out on that date.  So you learn, and adjust, now that you've encountered
reality. (As one general once observed, no battle plan every survived contact
with the enemy.)

     We've worked hard to make this a good show.  And it is a good show. We
occasionally hit speed bumps, but they're more the exception than the rule.
To say "Why can't they ALL be this good?" is like saying to a painter or a
composer, "Why can't your work ALL be on the same level?" There is always a
learning curve, always some works that are better than others.  It's not like
turning out widgets in a factory where you can guarantee certain parameters in
production.  To expect any art form to be consistent misses the point.  We
could aim lower to avoid falling into the occasional valleys, but I'd rather
aim high, and occasionally fall on my face, if it means hitting some peaks
that would otherwise be unattainable.  That's what taking chances means.  And
I think that's one thing that people find appealing about this show: we're not
resting on our laurels, or aiming for the safe, lowest-common-denominator;
we're willing to take chances.  We're right out there on the high-wire without
a net...no guarantees, no franchises, no built-in fan audience that will watch
us regardless of what we turn out.

     And shows like "Mind War," and "Sky," and "By Any Means Necessary," and
"Chrysalis" and "A Voice in the Wilderness" and "Babylon Squared" and other
kickass episodes are the consequence.  I think that in our first season, we've
turned out more really nifty episodes than some series do in their entire run.
Sidney Lumet once observed about his films that if you get just *one* really
golden moment on film, it's a success.  If we transplant that to television,
if in one season you get even *one* truly spiffy episode, it's a success.

     And we've got a hell of a lot more than one.

                                                                 jms

     There's a Billy Joel song, where one particular lyric (and I'm quoting
from memory) says, "You still have a pain inside you / That you carry with a
certain pride / It's the only part / Of a broken heart / You could ever save."
That's Ivanova.

     She's had her heart stomped on a lot.  And she's been holding it in.
Even with her father's death, she sucked in the pain, fought back the tears.
There is one episode, which will be right at the end of the year, where she
finds she can't run from her pain anymore...can't run from the tears...and
deals with them in a scene that's very moving and absolutely brings tears to
the eyes.

     Directing can add to an episode, making it more than it is, or can make

stories coming in for pretty much the rest of the season; there's an
acquaintance who comes back, and a reference to a prior relationship (but it's
not on the station, and doesn't take place there), but that's it.  No more
former lovers coming to the station this season, that I can think of.

     There's very little about one can say about "TWP" that I wouldn't respond
to with, "Yup."  Dorothy did a bangup job on the script, but so much gets lost
in translation sometimes.  All added up, there are only three episodes this
season that, for me, aren't up to the rest: this one, "Infection," and
"Grail."  That there are only 3 out of 22 is extremely good for ANY TV series.
(And again, that's only my POV; I know that there are a number of people who
liked this show, liked "Infection," andf will likely approve of "Grail."
Tastes vary.  I'm just very, very hard on *all* of our episodes.  I think you
have to look at your own work with as baleful an eye as possible.)

     One of the things I like about the sets is that they're actually fairly
large, and we tend to go for lots of extras to help carry through that sense
of scale.  It's not uncommon for us to have anywhere from 50 to 90 extras in a
scene, just to fill it out.  One scene had as many as 200-250 extras; many
others have between 150-200.  This is a *busy* place, and should feel like it.

     I'll have to check to see about the glitches; we've tracked down the
technical difficulties further, and discovered (among other things) that after
we'd delivered the episode, at one stage along the way they were being
transferred to 1" *used tape*.  Add in going from D2 to 1" and from that 1" to
others to do closed captioning and commercials, and you're bound to get some
weird stuff.  Starting next week, episodes will be going out with most of the
transfer work done on D2, not 1", so they should be cleaner henceforth.

     Bester wasn't killed because a) it took a *lot* out of Ironheart to take
out Kelsey, and b) Bester *shot him* prior to being taken down, and the pain
and trauma of being shot has a tendency to have an  adverse effect on one; it
took all his strength just to knock Bester down before collapsing to the
floor, his energy (as you can see in the film) fading away....

     Tony: yes, that ambiguity is something to consider.  I like ambiguity.
 I think.

     Yes, it was supposed to be closed-captioned, and there was a glitch after
we'd turned in the episode.  It'll be captioned for later broadcasts.  (BTW,
those who taped MW...I suggest you keep your tapes; there will be a subtle but
definite difference in one shot in all later airings of the show after this
next rerun.  And no, I'm not going to tell you what it is...but any copies of
the first version will probably be a rarity.)

     The core shuttle has hand-holds on the seats, and on the walls and other
areas.  They were both holding onto the lower hand-rails, though it can't be
seen in that shot.  It *is* visible in other episodes.

     A Rubik's Cube is a *very* good metaphor.

     The vaporized Starfuries *weren't* from B5, they were a separate wing not
attached to this station.  Black Omega is a special forces unit.

     "Believers" isn't next; up now comes "The War Prayer" by D.C. Fontana
(okay, despite some problems, mainly in direction), then "Sky."

     The Soul Hunter was hit by a PPG, but not terribly slowed; you'll see
others hit and harmed or killed by PPG down the road.

     (Actually, you'll see it in "Sky."

     Re: my favorite thing about this episode...it's that when all is said and
done, *nobody knows anything*.  Bester doesn't know what Ironheart is turning
into; Sinclair doesn't know if Ironheart was really telling the truth or not;
nobody knows where Ironheart went; nobody knows what the alien ship is/who
they were...the closest I can come to is to compare it to writing a mystery
novel, without revealing the killer, but *without* frustrating anyone in the
process, because there's *closure*.

     In so much of TV SF, *everything* has to be explained, often explained to
death.  I just love that in the B5 universe, it's okay for there to be
mysteries and wonders and the unexplained.

     I mentioned it up-topic; maybe someone has the number.

     Correct; the gates themselves are complex, extremely so, but they are
limited in production mainly by available amounts of Q40.  (Also, in most
cases, a gate is a gate is a gate; there's not much difference between them
visually.)

     And in the case of Sigma 957, one can put in a gate, start to explore
that sector of space...and discover to your chagrin that there is one planet
where you don't dare go near.  It's not like they *knew* that there was a
problem on Sigma 957 before they (the Narns) put the gate in; that was
discovered only afterward.  Sort of like buying a house and then discovering
that one room is haunted; you seal off the room and tell the kids not to go
near it.

                                                                jms

     You don't leave one gate and fly light years to another; you use the same
gate for going in and going out.  Explorer Ship A comes out of hyperspace;
looks around; decides that there are planets in this area that are worth
possible colonizing, exploitation, that sort of thing; it's a very quick
overview.  (Or they go to systems that have been already selected.)  They
construct a gate, finish the job, and move on.  Other ships can now use this
gate for entering and leaving this system.  Is this clearer?

                                                                jms
