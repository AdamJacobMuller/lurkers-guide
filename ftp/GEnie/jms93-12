     A few folks have noted in email that I've been kinda quiet
here of late,
and I just wanted to note that there are two reasons for this:

     1) Whenever something of mine is aired, or shown, as with
"Midnight," I
tend to adopt a low profile in order to avoid influencing or
directing the
conversation.

     As for 2)...a word in the ear of every person reading this who
uses the
keyboard incessantly: *BUY WRIST GUARDS*.  For the last year or so,
I've been
fighting carpal tunnel syndrome.  The problem is that I write 10-12
hours a
day, and when I'm going at white-heat, I've been clocked at nearly
120 words
per minute...one person who listened noted that during one
particular session
the click-click-click didn't pause, didn't slow for nearly twenty
minutes
straight.  I fall through the screen and come out somewhere else,
hours later.

     The downside of which being...I'm having *real* problems with
CTS right
now.  As we gear up for the last part of the season, I'm behind the
keyboard
constantly, when I'm not in editing.  During the Thanksgiving
break, I was
averaging 20 pages a day.  Early in that process, the CTS settled
in bigtime.
The pain is nearly constant, all day, all night.  To pick up a can
of soda is
an exercise in profound discomfort.  To *type* is beyond
description.  I'm
doing everything I can to minimize it, including sending for some
new wrist
supports and wrist braces, but apparently this stuff is cumulative.

     It's not stopping the writing, not by so much as a comma, but
it makes me
more inclined to quick, short messages than my usual mini-novels.
 I learned a long time ago how to burn through pain, so it's not a
problem on
that level.  Once the season's over, we'll evaluate where things
stand, and
whether this can be ameliorated by exercises or surgery or
whatever.   But I'm
a *writer*, and that means I'll write if they cut off my arms and
legs and I
have to type with my nose.  Nor is this message intended for
sympathy.  No
sympathies are expected or requested.  This is just one more
challenge to B5.


     My only thought at this moment is with those reading this: if
you do lots
of work behind the computer, take breaks, wear wrist braces, get a
support for
your keyboard, do wrist-hand exercises.  You wouldn't like this. 
Trust me.

     This show has been an act of sheer will now for nearly seven
years.   So
what else is new?

     By Friday we finish shooting "Chrysalis," which looks
*gorgeous*.   Then
comes "Deathwalker," with Sarah Douglas and Robin Curtis.  It's
another of our
very tough episodes, written by Larry the D.  With "Chrysalis" it's
12 down
and 10 to go.  We're on the downward slide, and it's coming up
fast.

     Later.

     Happily, the energy level here isn't flagging at all; if
anything,
there's been an infusion of energy, partially through being able to
show some
of our crew finishd episodes, so they can see the whole elephant
rather than
only isolated parts (to great reaction), and partly through the
reactions at
the con.  We're all feeling very renewed and rededicated toward the
show.

     I can't dictate as fast as I can type; and I don't think in
verbal terms,
I have to see it on the scren.  I tried it once, but found I'm just
not a very
good dictator (crew comments notwithstanding).

     A guest actor really can't add much beyond the episode in
which he or she
appears.  But behind the scenes...some of our cast learned a lot
while working
with Revell, and McCallum, and some of our other classically
trained guest
actors.  They were enjoyable experiences.  As far as the experience
they
had...all of our guests have to date expressed a hope to return in
other roles
at some point.  They've uniformly been treated well, and with
respect,
particularly those who've made their careers in SF, and are viewed
as "senior
officers" in a sense.  Some have described it as the best working
experience
they've had.

I turned that off, and the others went up faster.

     Darn, I hadn't noticed that.  See, starfury.gif is one of the
very
earliest graphic renderings we had of the fighter, mainly for
in-house.   The
logos had been put on mainly for place orientation.  It's not like
that
elsewhere...I'll upload a more current version.  I simply didn't
notice that.

     And yes, that's the bottom of the starfury.

     The GIF of the Starfury is letterboxed/wide.  Most of the

     Here's a thought to conjure with.  It takes about an hour to
render a CGI
frame that's very complex; 45 minutes if it's not terribly complex.
 With the new Screamer, we can cut down that time by about half, so
that a
highly complex scene can be rendered in 15-30 minutes.  Average
length for a
CGI scene is about 60 frames, so figure 30 hours.  You can do a
full show's
worth of CGI in about a week, give or take.

     Today we turn over the raw footage for a special scene that'll
be in one
of our episodes.  (Several scenes, actually, in the same episode.) 
 Ron's
elves will be rendering 24 hours a day (on automatic at night) for
the next
THREE WEEKS to do something very special with this episode.  If
it's done
right, it won't really draw attention to itself, it'll just be
very, very
cool.

and
skydance.gif.  The former is a shot of a group of Starfuries
leaving B5 with
the planet in BG, the latter is a shot of Catherine Sakai's survey

     Don't show 'em the pilot first.  Let 'em dive right in.

     Yeah, we do a LOT of ships this season.  I have gifs of them
all, and
some of them are mind-bogglingly nifty.  What I like about Ron's
work is that
many of the space shots are works of art you could practically
frame.  And
he's done one very important thing: he's brought COLOR into space,
in a big
way.  Ships are personalized, painted, textured and made into
things you enjoy
looking at.  The Starfury nicknamed the Sea Witch is a great
example of
this...as well as a bunch of others.

     Not all Starfuries are the same, btw...you'll be seeing a
different
category of them in "Mind War," and they're gorgeous.  Also very
scary.   Not
as scary, but more nifty, are the ones in "Survivors" and
"Chrysalis."

     Ah LOVES spaceships....

     And the program should be pretty nifty, from what I'm
heaing....

     Just uploaded another gif, the last for a little bit; 774,
named
cockpit.gif.  It's a composite shot of the interior of a Starfury
that's being
fired upon, the incoming blast whiting (or in this case greening)
out the
cockpit.  Is this shot from "Sky?"  Could be.

     It's a bit hard to look at because of the lighting, but it'll
give you
some idea of the interior of these things.

     BTW, tomorrow we do the final mix on "Sky."  And for that
episode,
Christopher Franke has composed a piece entitled "Requiem For the
Line," which
is very moving...at the same time brave and sad, hopeful and
ominous, martial
and doomed...one of the best things I've heard for TV.

     The other day, a reporter asked me what I wanted to accomplish
with
B5...and I remembered this commercial showing a viewer plastered
against the
wall opposite the TV...and that seemed about right.  I don't want
viewers to
see a show and say, afterward, "Well, that was a nice story."  
There has to
be more than that.

     And while we certainly have our episodes that are paced just
a little
more slowly, less intensely, because you have to have variation,
have to allow
time for character stories...there are some episodes, like "Sky,"
that just
hit the viewer right between the eyes with a 2 by 4 *real* hard and
say "HEY!
PAY ATTENTION!  WE'RE NOT KIDDING HERE!"

     Take no prisoners....

     Re: time per scene rendering...you have to understand that the
Toasters
render 24 hours a day.  Ron et al set 'em going before they leave
for the
night, and the next morning come in to pick up the finished scene. 
So you can
do a LOT of CGI in the course of a week.  Generally several minutes
of new
stuff per week...and yes, that includes long, panning shots.  Trust
me,
there's a LOT of CGI in just about every  episode of the series. 
A couple of
character-based stories are light, but they're more than
compensated for in
heavy-CGI stories like "Midnight," "Sky," and "Raiding Party," to
name a few.

     That's the logo for Starfury squadrons in general.  On the
opposite arm
goes the individual squadron name, such as Death's Hands
(Sinclair's squadron
on the Line), Ghost Riders (Ivanova's wing), and so on.

     Here's the interesting thing...ever since July, when we began
shooting,
we've been sitting here, doing our show quietly...and now, as
January nears,
slowly we've been growing aware of a sound...the PTEN and Warners
]MACHINE[
gearing up.  Press, promotion, photographers on the set, calls with
International and books divisions, and now the sound is quite
pervasive, like
a jet engine gearing up for flight.  Suddenly it comes clear, "Oh,
yeah, we're
not just making our little show here for ourselves, this is bigger
than just
us."  The energy level is definitely powering up around here.

     Had a reporter in here the other day, and he asked if it
bothered me that
other shows were getting all the ink...meaning, I suppose, TNG and
DS9 and
SQ:DSV...and my response really said it all, I think.  It's like
the Rocky
movie.  Let the other guys get all the press, do the big flashy
stuff, wave
around big budgets...we'll just stand here in a meat locker,
pounding slabs of
meat with our bare hands....

     The one thing that I'd like to point out is that Warner/PTEN
isn't in the
programming business.  This isn't a normal part of their PR
strategy.  The
only reason they have done this at all -- the B5 computer promo --
is in
recognition of the online support here and elsewhere.  They have
had to
contract out for this, and because this isn't a proven (yet)
strategy, could
only carve out so much for it.  No, not every platform is covered;
doubtless
that will change with time.  But it's generally never done at ALL. 
So I would
just temper the discussion with that reality.

     I have just seen the director's cut of "Chrysalis," which will
be the
last episode of this season...and I think it has just displaced
"Sky" as the
most heavy-weight episode of the season.  Even knowing what was
coming, I just
sat here, stunned, at the end of it.  Seeing dailies, bits and
pieces, doesn't
really prepare you for the whole thing.

     What I like most about it are two things: one, by about
halfway in, you
really begin to understand that anything can happen, to anyone, and
the rules
that normally carry you through a television episode no longer
apply.  It's a
very dangerous, dislocating feeling.  Two: you get the very real
feeling that,
after this episode, nothing is the same anymore.  The show has
taken a very
profound and *irrevocable* turn that will have lasting effects on
all of our
characters.  Of all the episodes so far, this one has the most
feeling of
being the chapter end in a novel.

     The really hard part will not avoiding the temptation to show
this to
people...because it really can't be allowed to get out prior to
airing.  There
are too many twists and turns and revelations that spin one off
into another.

     One other thing's certain: after you've seen "Chrysalis,"
you're going to
want to go back and check out three prior episodes...because
something that
you will have read/interpreted one way, without question or
hesitation
accepting it as what it obviously appears to be, will suddenly be
turned on
its head, and a brand new interpretation will emerge.  And it's
*real*
creepy....

     I doubt there would be much problem at all in translating it
to the other
platform.

     Arne: slight correction to your correction.  No scene with
Chan or
Eastman was "removed," it's simply an incorrect listing.  Chan and
Eastman are
both in "The War Prayer," they were never in "Infection" in any
way, manner,
shape or form.  It was simply a typo on the part of the person who
wrote up
the lists, putting names from one show into the wrong sheet.

     When we did the research on how a fighter could best operate
in zero
gravity, it seemed to require a four-wing axis with thrusters on
every side.
We've thus taken every possible step to make them NOT look like
x-wings,
particularly since there's no long, sleek forward section at *all*,
it's a
snub-nose, and the wings don't move, plus they have the unusual
thruster
combination.

     "Trax" is/or was still running new eps as of a few weeks ago. 
The
schedule was deliberate, to make what they had stretch.  That may
change this
season; we'll have to see.  Haven't heard yet re: the final
schedule.  For our
part, we have 6 finished (completely done, music, sound, all that)
episodes in
hand now, and will have one more by the christmas break.  By the
time we go on
the air, we'll have a total of 12-14 in hand, so we're in great
shape in terms
of scheduling stuff.

     Although in the new laserdisk set of SW movies, the matting is
FAR less

     Some thoughts on the crew, btw...which besides being
sensational on its
own terms, is a very caring bunch of guys.  Some of them have been
making
expeditions to the post office lately, gathering Santa letters and
circulating
them to grant wishes for toys.  There's a wall of letters that have
been
answered so far with presents.  Just one example; there are more. 
They're

     Re: the Oliver Stone thing...that's a comment made during the

what's done

it; though
we'll be mixing and finishing it in the next few weeks, we won't be
turning it
over to PTEN until shortly before airdate, because we don't want
this getting

affected...or strongly set up for profound changes in the very near

     For those who might be interested, I thought I'd pass along a
quick view
of the process of producing a show like B5, step by step (though
briefly).

     Day Minus 21: The script is finalized and distributed to all
cast and
crew.

     Day Minus 14: The episode goes into serious pre-production,
with meetings
on visual effects, wardrobe, CGI and so on.  Props are designed and
construction begun on both props and wardrobe and any sets that are
specific
to that episode.

     Day Minus 10: Tone meeting with director and producers to make
sure all
parties see the story the same way.  Casting, begun on day 14, is
finalized
about this time.

     Day Minus 6: Major production meeting with all departments, at
which each
scene is gone through in detail, examining and reinforcing what
props,
costumes, extras and lighting requirements are needed per scene.

     Day One: Filming Starts.

     Day Seven: Filming finishes.  Editing has been going on since
day 2, as
dailies arrive at the studio, with editors making rough assemblies
of the
scenes as they come in.

     Day Eight/Nine: the director works with the editor to make the
first,
Director's Cut of the episode, relying to some degree on the
preliminary
Editor's Cut.

     Day 10/11: Producers begin making their cut.  (Mainly me and
John
Copeland.)  Sit with editor and view each scene, picking out
various takes and
angles, integrating CGI.  Sometimes the cut varies a lot from the
Director's
Cut and is a whole new version...or it is very close to the
Director's Cut.
Producer's Cut finished around day 12/13.

     Day 15: Producer's Cut is sent to primary editing bay for
on-line
editing, at which the frames of actual film are slugged and readied
for the
real thing (as opposed to editing computer images on the Avid).

     Day 20: Episode is color-timed to make sure color values are
correct.

     Day 25: Spotting session...producers, sound designer,
composer, dialogue
editors meet and review the on-line edit or CTM (color timed
master) to
determine where sound and music should be placed, the kind of sound
or music
required, and number of frames/seconds duration.  Second spotting
session with
visual EFX supervisor to determine rotoscoping or other non-CGI EFX
placement.

     Day 39: Final mix-down of all elements: music, sound, looping,
visual
effects and other elements.  For this we sit in the mixing bay from
9 a.m. to
7 p.m. nonstop, bringing in lunch, to determine balance of sound to
music,
music to dialogue, which elements to use or lose, and so on.

     Day 46: Finished episode delivered to PTEN and in-house.

     Total time required: 57 days.  And during this period, we are
simultaneously editing at least 4-5 other shows, and have shot
roughly
another 6 episodes, which are also in various stages of editing.

     I've glossed over a few things, but that should give you some
idea of the
process and the highlights thereof.

     We're still working out book details.  One possibility is also
to take
the most heavily arc-related episodes, stitch them together into a
novelized
form, and publish them so that there in one book is the major part
of that
year's arc.  Other approaches are still being investigated.

     And yes, in TV, it's the exec producer who generally gets the
final cut,
whereas in film it's often the director (or, in some cases, the
studio).

     We took care of 'em.

     Quick updates: expect some coverage of B5 in Entertainment
Weekly, TV
Guide and CNN.  There will be full-page color ads for B5 in People,
Sports
Illustrated, TV Guide, and other major magazines.  The Clippers
game on
Channel 13 L.A. the night before our debut will be "Brought to you
by Babylon
5," and after the game, around 9:30, there will be the half-hour
"Making Of
Babylon 5" documentary.  Also expect to start seeing ads on the
back covers of
DC comics books in the next week or so.  There will be a slow but
steady
increase in print, TV and radio ads over the next few weeks.  It's
estimated,
with the huge PR campaign that's been developed, that 90% of the
country will
have seen at least one B5 ad, and 50% of the country will have seen
roughly 10
ads.  Those of you who have been eagerly looking for this
stuff...will
probably, like me, be so sick of seeing them after a while...but
it's part of
the process of bringing the show to the non-modemed.

     After the Christmas break, we'll be two-thirds finished with
our
production on the first season.  It's just *zipped*
past...amazing....

     For starters, the Orion constellation would not look like the
Orion
constellation from another POV, say, 30 light years from here. 
Another
cluster of stars might *look* the same, or similar, but anyone
expecting to
see the constellations as we recognize them from here is going to
be
disappointed.

     As far as I know, from what Ron's said re: constellations,
while it may
look like Orion, it isn't.  It's perception, the mind looking for
patterns it
recognizes.

     Catherine Sakai is all business.  Not much for display.

     It's "J. Michael Straczynski" on title credits mainly because
that's the
way it looks best, frankly.  Lets you sneak up on the whole name in
progressively larger bites.  Joe Michael Straczynski looks kinda
dumb to me,
also too long; Joe Straczynski is too short, and unbalanced in
terms of layout
(he said quickly).  My friends call me Joe.  My crew calls me Joe. 
One person
on the crew kept calling me Mr. Straczynski, which you should try
saying out
loud sometime.  Even *I* can't do it.  It was so painful to listen
to that
after a while I kept calling back "Joe" at him until he got the
message.

     Starting Thursday, we're on Christmas break (well, for
everybody else
maybe; I've got to finish "The Ressurectionist" and then start on
my next
script, taking advantage of the quiet time to plow through some
work).  We're
roughly two-thirds finished with production on the first season.

     One thing I can mention now, since it's nearly finished: see,
I have this
real problem with nepotism.  Specifically...I hate it.  As a
result, I make
people I know work twice as hard.  The closer the tie, the more the
person has
to work to prove him or herself.

     Kathryn Drennan, my Spousal Overunit, is also a writer, and
has written
for many other shows, primarily in animation, but with some forays
into other
areas.  (She was co-author on the Night  Gallery series of articles
I wrote
for Twilight Zone Magazine, as one fr'instance, and was a producer
with public
televison for some time.)

     Anyway, she desperately wanted to write a B5 script.  But
because of my
feelings about nepotism, I refused to give her an assignment.  (I
can be a
REAL pain in the ass.)  Something similar happened when I was
working on The
Real Ghostbusters; she loved the show, and wanted to write for it. 
I put her
through the wringer: she had to submit written premises, just like
any other
freelance writer, which were then sent on to the producers for
final approval.
They did not know of any relation between her and me; they based
their
approval only on the merits of the story.  Period.  And she ended
up writing
two episodes: "Egon's Dragon" and "The Man Who Never Reached Home." 
(The
former is considered a favorite by many viewers of the show.)  Only
long after
we finished production did the exec producers on TRGBs learn that
there was a
relationship there; it was all based on the quality of the work.

     But in the case of B5, I *am* the exec producer, so it became
more
difficult.  At first I said simply no.  Finally, I set into place
a number of
conditions/provisions.  NOT because she wouldn't do a great script,
but only
because I don't like the look of nepotism; I hate it, and I hate
the way this
town operates on the principles of nepotism.  The conditions were
that she had
to write the script completely on spec, no assignment; not a spec
outline,
which is shorter, but a spec *script*.   It would then have to pass
muster in-
house; if even one person thought it wasn't up to snuff, it got
deep sixed.
And revisions would not be handled by me, for the most part; she
would have to
work with Larry, who has a reputation (as Katherine Lawrence can
attest) to
not pulling his punches.   No favoritism.  Then the script would
have to pass
muster with Warners.   IF, after all that, the script was approved,
then it
would be bought, and not a moment before.  If anywhere along the
line it
didn't meet one of those criteria...then it would be a 50 page
learning
experience and nothing more.

     Well, I'm pleased to say that it *did* pass muster with
everyone, and "By
Any Means Necessary" is now over halfway through production, with
a number of
people -- including Michael O'Hare -- saying it's their favorite so
far,
mainly for very odd reasons.  The premise is one that ST would
never, EVER do,
which is one thing I like about it; it also shows us more on the
inner
workings of B5, the blue-collar types who keep the whole place
operational...and what happens when that falls apart.  The B story
gets into a
confrontation between G'Kar and Londo when Londo interferes in an
important
Narn religious observation.

     We brought back John Snyder (Soul Hunter #2) minus prosthetics
for one
guest role, and Katy Boyer as our other guest star.  They're both
doing
terrific jobs, and it's a very intense script in which we basically
put
Sinclair through the wringer for 48 hours and try and make him 
absolutely
nuts.  And succeed, for the most part.

     Anyway...there you have it.

     (Incidentally..."Mind War" has come out so well that it looks
like we're
going to move it up in the schedule a bit.  It was orignally slated
to run
about episode 10 or so, but the studio is so hot on it that it'll
probably run
#6, right after "Parliament."  And Walter has agreed to be the
voice-over and
on-camera narrator for the Behind the Scenes/Making of Babylon 5
documentary.)

     Will try the black magnetite tapes.  (Is that like red
kryptonite?)   I
almost exclusively use TDK hi-fi or SVHS otherwise.

     Work on the documentary should be finished sometime early next
week, and
transmitted to the stations sometime thereafter, by about a week or
so.
Walter seems fine.

     Me...I'm glad it's the production break.  I need to sleep in
a bit, and
catch up with some work, and find the floor of my home office
again, which is
currently covered by scripts, comics, and reams of paper.  I've
worked on
shows before, but never in this major a capacity, running the
damned thing,
especially the way this has to be run...meaning you can't let any
details slip
past, no matter how small...and frankly, as Arnold said in T2, "I
need a
vacation."  When we hit the Thanksgiving break, I crashed one night
and didn't
even see the next day, slept right through until that night. 
There's nothing
that can really prepare you for a job like this.

     Re: moving "Mind War" up...no, doesn't affect continuity at
all.  If it
did, it wouldn't have gotten moved.  It's what's called in the biz
a "moveable
piece," able to go *almost* anywhere in the schedule, as long as
it's after
episode 3 and before episode 15, since stuff in the first few set
it up, and
15 pays off part of it.

     "Babylon Squared" hasn't been filmed yet; it'll probably be in
the last
batch of five episodes filmed, and will likely air around #19 or so
in the

     As I write this, we are now exactly one month, 30 days, from
the launch
of the series.  In one month, you will know if I've been blowing
smoke up your
CRTs, or if we've been telling the truth.  Starting in one month,
as the
ratings come in, we'll know if our experiment is a success, or if
we've missed
the target.

     There are moments when I'm utterly convinced that we've got a
hit on our
hands...and moments when I'm just as convinced that nobody is going
to hear
about us, or notice...and that the future of B5 will be consumed by
a vast,
cosmic yawn.  Alternating moments of exhiliration and terror,
confidence and
doubt.

     I know that the series contains some of the best writing I've
ever done;
if in my entire life, I never do anything other than "Chrysalis,"
I will still
be content, because that's the single best thing I've ever done,
and it came
out even better than I'd hoped, on every level.  Maybe my best is
good enough.
Maybe it ain't.  Fundamentally, despite all the planning, and
production, and
advertising, and good will...it's still a crap shoot.  You never
know what'll
click.  "Picket Fences" is arguably the best-written show on TV,
but it's in a
constant battle to survive.

     It's been a very, very long haul...from the 1986/87 writing of
the script
and bible, to the time of TWCBN, and from the pilot to the series.
 To some extent, it's become the focus for a lot of people's hopes
and
expectations of what *they* think the perfect SF series would be. 
And some of
those people are bound to be disappointed, simply because no show
can equal
every single person's expectations and personal preferences.   All
we can do
is tell a story, as best we can, and hope that others like that
story as much
as we do.  It won't be the Babylon 5 that's in your head; it'll be
the Babylon
5 that's in my head...and we'll have to see if that is sufficient
to hold the
interest of viewers.  Sometimes I think it's too eccentric. 
Sometimes I think
we haven't dared enough.  Sometimes I think there's too much humor. 
Sometimes
I think there isn't enough humor.  And on and on and on....

     In one month, the reality of what Babylon 5 is will begin to
be seen
across the country.  And then we shall see what we shall see.  I
showed Harlan
two episodes recently, "Sky" and "Parliament."  He has always been
our hardest
critic to please.  And he said that there wasn't a single false
note in it
anywhere.  I've gotten similar reactions to episodes from D.C.
Fontana and
David Gerrold and Terry Dowling and others known in the SF
community.  Which
gives me some measure of hope.

     Every once in a while, I allow myself the luxury of thinking
we've really
*got* something here.  But in one month, I won't need to wonder,
and *you*
won't need to wonder anymore.  It'll be right out there for all to
see.

     Yikes....

     Generally speaking, in television, you're lucky to get on
screen about
half of what you had in mind when you saw it in your head.  So far,
the
average here is about 80%.  In a very few cases, I don't think the
finished
episode delivers as well as it might on the script, but for the
clear majority
of them, the episodes come through.  And in some cases, like "Sky"
and
"Parliament" and especially "Chrysalis," I got *over* 100% of what
I had in
mind...it came out even better than what I'd had in my head when I

It's a confluence of many factors...the guest star and how much
he/she *gets*
it, the EFX, the direction, and other things.   But across the
board, I'd have
to say that I'm very satisfied.

     I'm not sure, from my perspective, that there's any one
definition of
success that I'd use.  There are several: 1) How much is the
project in its
final form what I conceived it to be?  This is something that
Harlan keeps
hammering home at me, pointing to what happened to him on  the
Starlost by way
of comparison...it was dreadful, and he had to take his name off
it.  It's the
show I wanted to make, made the way I wanted to make it, so on that
level, I'm
content.

     2) The ratings.  Is what we conceived of interest to other
people, or
have we missed the mark?  Television, like any other medium, is
aimed at an
audience.  If the audience isn't there, then it comes down to "does
the tree
make a noise when it falls in an empty forest?"  Whether it's good
or bad
becomes nominally irrlevant.  And 3) Whether or not anyone talks
about the
show, or remembers the show, years down the road.  Something can
get a lot of
attention, critical acclaim, ratings, be what the creators
envisoned...and be
gone in a year, the flavor of the month.

     If I had to pick one, it'd be #3.  As an atheist, my sense is
that one
achieves immortality by the effect one has on others.  If the show
lives on
beyond me, then I am satisfied.  Twain observed: "If you want your
work to
live forever...and by forever I mean fifty years...it must neither
overtly
preach nor overtly teach...but it must *covertly* preach and
*covertly*
teach."

     I am an atheist, a total atheist, and am more than happy. 
What I write
is what I write, what I am is what I is.

     Yes, much of my own background goes into what I write.  In the
case of
religion, and spirituality...a writer's job is to be as honest as
he can in
telling a story.  My canvas (for lack of a less grandiose term) is
the human
condition.  And since the dawn of sentience, humanity has been
trying to
figure out its place in the universe.  The religious impulse is as
much a part
of that process as anything else, and it must be treated with
integrity and
respect, as I would have my own views respected.  I try not to
exclude
something just because I don't agree with it, because that corrupts
the whole
purpose of writing, which requires an honest look at the subject.

     And as a writer, there are parts of the religious impulse that
I want to
examine, and explore, and raise questions about, just as much as
I'd like to
explore the scientific aspects of living in space, and the more
personal,
emotional repercussions of this.  It's all a part of trying to
figure out who,
and what, and *why* we are.

     Since Mike mentioned it...yes.  "Babylon Squared" answers the
B4
question...though posing new questions about *why*.  Basically,
every question
we ask going into the first season we will answer, because I don't
think it's
right or fair or smart to keep people hanging around 3 years to get
a simple
answer to a simple question.  Season 1 of B5 is what I generally
call the
"what" season...you find out WHAT the Psi Corps is, WHAT happened
at the
Battle of the Line, WHAT happened to Babylon 4, and so on...whereas
Season 2
is the "why" season...WHY did that happen to Sinclair?  And so on. 
New
questions arise, and we proide new answers, generally within the
course of the
following season, but while at all times making sure that each
episode stands
alone, regardless of where and which season you enter the series as
a viewer.

     (It's kinda like being one of those guys on the old Ed
Sullivan show,
spinning plates on top of long, thin rods...there's a LOT to keep
in motion at
all times.)

     I'd classify the pilot movie as "who."

     Don't know really how much more there is to say; it's getting
to that
time when all the worthwhile talking will be done by the series
itself.

     There will definitely be a two-parter this season; PTEN is so
much in
love with what they're seeing that they've allocated a bit more on
budget to
let us really go to town on a 2-part episode.  I'll be either
writing both
parts, or sharing the task with Larry DiTillio, depending on when
he gets free
with his next script.

     There are now about five scripts remaining to be written,
including
"Babylon Squared," which will probably be finished sometime next
week.  We
begin shooting D.C. Fontana's second script for us, "Legacies,"
starting next
Monday, then two JMS scripts, the first of which is "Raiding
Party," which
will probably tie up Ron's computers for *ages*.  I finished
another script
the other day, which I think came out fairly well.

     So far, this season you'll learn a lot about all the cultures
of our
ambassadors, especially the Big Four; you'll see the League of
Non-Aligned
Worlds in action; you'll learn a LOT about the Psi  Corps, Earth
government
and economics, the inner workings of Babylon 5, the history of the
Babylon
project, Sinclair's background (also a lot about Ivanova's and
Garibaldi's
past)...you'll see a darker side of Londo, a lighter side of G'Kar,
a more
ambiguous side of Delenn, some very weird sides of Kosh...and
you'll come away
with a real sense of B5 as a *place*, a habitat, where things are,
what they
do, how it works.  There will be an awful lot of action, and an
even greater
amount of humor...there are parts of the show that, even having
seen them 16
times, are still fall-down funny.

     Other than that...not much to say.

     Kathryn's last name is Drennan.  Her full credit is Kathryn M.
Drennan.
Not Straczynski.  Probably displaying considerable wisdom on her
part.  Ten
thousand letters, no vowels.

     Absent a collaboration on a series of articles for TZ Magazine
a few
years ago (a guide to the Night Gallery series), we don't
collaborate.   Ever.
I also don't collaborate with Larry D., or any other of my writer
friends.  As
I learned before, particularly on the one occasion when Larry and
I tried it --
we co-wrote a pilot and bible for CBS based on the "Elfquest" books
-- all
parties concerned will live a LOT longer by keeping a respectable
distance.

     Mike: we're not going to see a lot of Sinclair in the past,
only what is
necessary to understand the present...and there are going to be
transformations, but I prefer to see my transformations take place
in the
present, pointing toward the future, than in flashback.

     The difference, I suppose, is that in many shows, characters
arrive at
Point X in a series at the very beginning, and stay there for the
duration,
and we are sometimes shown what made them that way.  In B5, what
I'm trying
for is to take a certain set of characters, and move them all
toward
substantive changes in their lives, their characters, their beliefs
and their
allegiances.  Just about everyone on B5 is running to, or away from
something.
I don't want that simply as backdrop, I want that something to
*catch up with
them*.  That, to me, is where the fun starts.

     No, the closest parallel to the Centauri would, I suppose, be
ancient
Rome.  I tend not to go that much to contemporary sources for
metaphor, since
it's too obvious and over-done.  Much of what's in B5 is drawn from
much older
sources.  The only exception, the only means of creating a metaphor
for the
present, is one that will take some time before it's even
perceptible, though
by the end of the season, you'll see what it is pretty clearly.

     Consumer Reports looks at the baseline requirements for most
people, and
the majority of videotape users aren't videophiles, they're folks
who maybe
reecord a show off the air for later viewing, record somebody's
wedding, that
sort of thing.  Things like signal to noise ratio and video
dropouts really
don't mean much.

     The degree of difference increases the higher you go into
video
equipment.  A small 21" old color TV won't show much difference
between tapes.
A 32" fairly new Sony Trinitron will.  Similarly, if you're piping
your audio
through the TV speaker, you won't notice much difference.  If
you're sending
it through a surround system, you will.  For the majority of the
population,
and the majority of available equipment, yes, there's not much
point in
distinguishing between them.

     If you want the real skinny on videotapes, go to such consumer
oriented
publications as Video Review or Video Magazine, which do very
comprehensive
tests on videotapes.  You'll find out more than you could possibly
want to
know.  Generally, TDK comes out at or near the top every year. 
Same for
Maxell in general.  Which is why I use TDK almost exclusively, and
have never
had a problem.

     I think the material will be repeated, but I'm not 100% sure. 
I know
there will be two 30 second spots, two 15 second spots, and three
10 second
spots, so I doubt they'd need 45 minutes total to do all of that.
 But don't take my word for it.

     Centauri males wear their hair in this fashion, the length of
which is
determined by the person's status.  Centauri women scorn such
symbols of
status and go bald except for a knot of hair from the back.  (Sort
of a
peacock approach.)

     Londo's people go for jewelry and ornamentation such as medals
and
sunbursts and the like; Minbari don't do a lot of ornamentation,
going instead
for fabrics, textures and colors.

     Yeah, fairly much, as far as it goes.  There's some Jananese
influence,
as well as some early European influences, as well as middle
Eastern
influences.  (There are three Minbari castes: the worker, warrior
and
religious castes.)

     Is it the color logo on the shirt, or the black-and-white
logo?

Sub: Governments and Trade in B5        

Most SF shows simply posit a government of sorts, and blithely
ignore it ever
afterwards. You might see a freighter (with a big "shoot me!" sign
on it) but
no other mention of trade. How about B5?

     As soon as the ship comes through, its signature is registered
and the
fees debited against their account, if they have one at the
station.   If not,
the incoming person is asked for payment before being allowed onto
the
station.  In some cases, as with transports, corporations buy jump
gate access
in bulk, and then assign the routes to their various transports. 
(Believe it
or not, this actually comes up in dialogue in "Midnight.")

     Ah, but remember, the government is the one who put the jump
gate in; no
one individual or corp could afford to do that.  When your ship, if
Earth
registered, comes through, you're automatically billed, just like
income
tax...it goes against your credit.  If you're not Earth registered,
you pay
when you arrive at an Earth port or orbital transfer station. 
Either way, you
pay.  If you try to land somewhere without proper authorization,
you'll be
arrested and your ship confiscated.

     Now, you could probably come through the gate, hang in space
for a while,
and go back in again (IF you're a non-Earth registered ship) and
not pay
anything...but in that case, what's the point?  It'd be like taking
a
difficult trip in a small ship across the Atlantic, and not getting
out or
going ashore once you arrive.

     They are both guns.

     The canopy closes and locks.  If hit, there's at least the 
opportunity
for the canopy section to eject from the rest of the craft before
it's
destroyed.

     For those who might be interested, we've come up with some
name for the
various clans of the Minbari warrior caste.  The primary five are
the Star
Riders (the oldest), the Moon Shields, the Wind Swords, the Night
Walkers and
the Fire Wings.  (The first three refer to the early Minbari
version of a
mounted force, for which you need riders with shields and swords,
with #4
referring to foot soldiers, and the last to those whose clan first
used flying
machines in battle.)

     (Oh, and Star Riders refers to those mounted soldiers who were
trained to
use the stars for navigation.  Behind them came the foot soldiers,
who were
expert at traveling by night.)

     In "Infection," Garibaldi tells one person, who's been looking
for
Sinclair (and whom Sinclair is ducking) that "the commander'll take
any
opportunity to take out a fighter; he's like that."  Sinclair is
first and
foremost a *pilot*, this is what he loves.  And thus he does it
wherever he
can (also to continue his flight pay, he like any other officer
needs to log
in X-hours of flight time per month).

     In "Soul," there's only room for one ship to go out and link
up with
another ship that's out of control, it's not a combat situation, so
it makes
sense for Sinclair, since he has the most combat/flying time on the
station,
to go out after it.  It's also a potential first-contact situation,
which
doubles the importance of a command officer.  I "Midnight" he goes
out because
there's something that he knows that others wouldn't know to react
to.

     But at the same time, in "Midnight," when the first distress
calls come
in, it's Garibaldi who takes out a ship; in "Believers" it's
Ivanova.  In the
combat-heavy "Raiding Party," it's Garibaldi and Ivanova in ships,
while
Sinclair stays behind in C&C.  In "Believers," Ivanova states that
regulations
require the presence of a command officer in long-range flights
that may
involve combat.

     Yes, there are instances where other EA officers come aboard
with
equivilent or close ranks to our characters.  In one particular
episode it
makes for some considerable conflict....
