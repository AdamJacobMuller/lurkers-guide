Subject: Re: ATTN JMS: Are *you* happy with S4 perceived "rush"?

Truth: I go back and forth.  The "Into the Fire" thing, for instance...it
would've likely been a two-part episode, but it still would've ended up
exactly where it ended up.  A few more big explosions, but I wonder also
if that really adds anything past a certain point.

>From a production standpoing, since "Fire" darn near killed us in the CGI
department, it's probably a darned good thing it DIDN'T go for 2 eps. 
That puppy had something around 120 or 140 EFX shots.

Overall, I'm actually quite happy with how this season is going, in terms
of the intensity of the arc and the emotions and incidents.  Parts
would've been a bit more laid-back if I had decided not to cover my bets
on renewal, and maybe the situation has worked out to the best (again the
ABA principle, Art By Accident).

So I dunno...all I know is what's in the episodes this season, and it's
pretty cool overall....

would I be able to follow the action and make even a rough sense of it,

slightly in the direction of too much recap, but I'd rather do that than
totally confuse people.

I've only seen the first 2 installments (the second 2 are on tape,
awaiting a time when I have 4 hours to spend), and I think they're doing
well.  The new Crow is generally okay, though the person doing the
voice/puppetry (his name just fell out of my head) needs to animate him a
bit more.  Trace understood that you have to make Crow a living character,
and it ain't just the voice.  Crow had very visual and expressive
movements, which so far the new guy hasn't quite gotten yet.  

I wasn't that impressed with Dr. Forrester's mom in the previous season,

I'm definitely familiar with Campbell's work.  In the case of B5, it was
sort of in the back of my head, but I didn't work to stick to the
progression point for point, because I was afraid then it becomes
mechanical.  "Hero" is good for analysis *after* the fact, not during...if
you try to apply it during the creative process, it becomes like the
centipede asked which foot goes first.  It's an analytical device, not a
creative device.  

That was the problem with "Beyond Thunderdome."  Prior to then the Mad Max
movies were written on their own terms; prior to BT, George Miller read
"Hero," and worked too hard to make it all fit.

Kathryn, for obvious reasons, is the only person on the planet whose
knowledge of the B5 universe is second only to my own.  Especially the
backstory, the history of the characters and worlds, and so on.  She's
seen virtually every frame of film.  So when I got the idea of having one
of the books follow Sinclair's story after leaving B5, through a year of
story time that weaves in and out of the books, the comic, and the
show...she was the logical candidate.  The only one that made sense.  She
was hesitant to do so at first, for various reasons, but she's always been
very fond of the Sinclair storyline, and Michael O'Hare, and wanted to
tell that story.  So she agreed to write it.

And of all the novels, this one is 100% canon...it's also the most
exhaustive attempt to tie in all the storylines done to date.  Anybody
wants to know what happened to Sinclair, it's in the book.  That's a
genuine chapter of the story arc.

"As an atheist, do you find Clinton's ban on human cloning somewhat silly?
 Do you think of a cloned child as any different than any other child?"

Go ahead, ask me the easy ones that won't get me into trouble....

I think people are overly-frightened by the idea.  They have an
exaggerated idea of what it means.  You can clone me (a scary thought on
its own terms, but that's a different discussion) to your heart's
content...but the fact is, though the genetic makeup is the same, the
environmental, social and psychological conditions that made me what I am
(insert joke here) will not be present for the new kid, and you'll get a
VERY different adult.  

In a sense, there's been 50% cloning going on throughout history; it goes
on every day, every 30 seconds: a child is conceived using DNA templates
from two people, the parents.  Now we're talking about DNA templates from
one person. 

Should caution be used?  Absolutely.  A total ban on research?  How can we
make proper ethical decisions without the most thorough information we can
get our hands on?  "No, let's not find out what's really involved until
*after* we make our decision."  This is like having a trial after the jury
has rendered a verdict.

Because that technology has potential uses *outside* strict cloning.  If a
father is infertile, could you use the cloning techniques to separate out
his DNA and use it to fertilize his wife's eggs?  There are many other
possible uses for this technology; to throw the baby out with the DNA
seems to me a poor idea.

Subject: Re: I wish JMS had ignored the season 4 / season 5 thing.

Understand that you over-estimate the power of fandom in the current TV
market.

For starters the studios have gotten used to letter writing campaigns by
SF fans, and no longer give it the same weight they used to.  

If WB decides to drop year 5, it will be an internal business decision,
and will not be subject to appeal.  About one-third of all new shows
presented at NATPE this year to the stations either aren't going or are in
serious trouble because WB, UPN and FOX are grabbing more nights of
committed programming at local stations...in simple terms: there is no
room at the inn.

That's the single biggest obstacle right now to WB renewing the show, I'm
told.  That the market has changed, and the stations either have other
commitments, or are tempted by new, highly-promoted shows, as opposed to a
fifth year of a show they know.  

I've had to make adjustments to cover my bets in either direction; if I
did what you describe, and there ended up not being a year 5, the story
would not have an ending, and the thing would be pointless.  It's not a
matter of "sticking to one's guns."  It's a matter of protecting the fans,
and the story, because I have no control whatsoever over what's going to
be decided shortly.  Neither do the fans.  It ain't the same world as when
ST was saved for one more season.  We've been told, point-blank, that WB
*wants* to do the show next year, because they're making a LOT of money on
it...but if there's no room for the show at enough stations to make it
viable, they won't be able to do it.  (And they can't take it to cable, we
found out this week, because the PTEN contract for the show expressly
forbids it).

I've isolated the threads that would go into a year 5; if we get year 5,
I'll pull the triggers on that, and we'll do those stories.  If not, those
threads will go into the sequel.  Either way, we're covered...because I
can't ask fans to stick around for 4 or 5 years of a show, and not achieve
resolution.  It would be thoughtless and cruel.

Date: 7 Mar 1997 14:17:23 -0500
Subject: Re: Worries about TNT showing B5?

It's my understanding that TNT will not cut anything from the shows...in
fact, due to PTEN dropping the Kung Fu 30 second promo (temporarily filled
by a 30 second B5 promo at 40 minutes into the program), we were told this
week that we now have an additional 30 seconds that we can add to the
show's length.  When we heard this, we asked if we were to put this in
only to have it cut by TNT later, but were told that it would be left
intact.  (They can't put in any more commercials because it's currently at
the maximum allowable limit under FCC rules.)

I imagine the logo will appear, as it standard with all such shows.

I have to say that TNT has proven to be *very* excited about picking up
B5, and they want to do a great deal of promotion for it, and plan to make
it a real centerpiece.  If fans of the show want to write to them to
continue to encourage this, and to thank them for wanting to treat the
show right (thus encouraging more of this in future), and suggest their
support and creative freedom for the upcoming sequel now in negotiations,
I certainly think nobody would object....

We're going to be doing a few more things, incrementally.  Del Rey is
coming out with more nonfiction B5 books, starting with reprints of the
Bassom UK books on B5, then the 3 volume episode guide covering the first
three seasons (with more to come, obviously), and a number of other
nonfiction books that are starting to move ahead, detailing the production
and related areas of B5.

The Hamilton Collectors plates will start coming out shortly (the Sheridan
one is very nice, but the real killer is the Delenn plate, which is just
stunning), same for the Antioch Publishing stuff, including bookmarks,
bookplates, journals, magnets and the like (and they've done some
*terrific* stuff at Antioch, including bookmarks with each year's
narration).  

I saw a test run on the first part of the B5 informational CDrom which
we're doing in-house the other day, and it's just spiffy...gorgeous
looking, and it's going to be just a bit on the subversive side, as is
standard with anything B5.  I'll have to check, but I think we're shooting
for a spring release on this one.

There's more cards coming out from Fleer, a new version fo the B5 comic
(with a starting 3-issue arc written by me (issue 1) and Peter David (2
and 3), some character figures to be released in groups of 3, and the
Monogram/Revell models coming down the pike shortly.  The B5 RPG and

A complete film print is never made.........yet.  (I have learned that

The international (read PAL/SECAM) and archival (read 16:9) versions are
from a conformed negative, that has black placed where the effects shots
are.  Those shots are converted or remade from the digital source, and
cut into the show in the WB resolution independent post environment.

We have done tests (early on and recently) to prove that the CG and

Subject: Re: ATTN JMS and/or GEORGE:  Videssence, Inc.?

Oh those Netter financial press releases!

SRGB is a new calibration standard for a cool burning, stable,
predictable lighting for entertainment and other uses.  Currently in
development are a new "kit" of stage lights that will excite the
emulsion of film properly so that what is seen on the set can be exactly
what is realized on the film when it is transferred.  The lights are
based on a custom flourescent formulation with a digitally switched
power supply and exciter.  This is new territory, and has some exciting
possibilities for production.

The Videssence lighting is being used at B-5 primarily as "gimmick"
lighting until such time as JFlinn3 decides that it is a reasonable
replacement for the Incandescent lights that are the norm for film based
production.  When the lights are perfected, there will be no visible
color difference to the viewer.   The technology involved will allow 
smaller instruments to be used, and there will be some different effects
possible.  These will be realized after the baseline success has been
achieved.

When that happens, I will let you know what to look for!

and frustrating process.  

Fortunately, the process on different models can work simultaneously, if
they are not using the same sculptor.  The release schedule will be
adjusted as the project proceeds.

It is interesting that the merchandising for B5 is starting to get
REALLY hot.  Warners Special Products is really B5 happy right now. 
Hope this bodes well for future products!

Leo-

Not exactly true!  We start new episodes the week of April 28 with
episode 410 (Racing Mars), and go straight through  May with new eps.

All of our syndication contracts are for the full season 4 with the
entities that are broadcasting the show now.

Hi 5heads!

Letterboxing will not happen on TNT.  Sorry. They will be showing the
original episodes uncut, in their original broadcast form. 

If and when DVD happens for B5 it will most certainly be 16:9.  All of
the prep work is done for that release.

Subject: Re: ATTN JMS: Apologies for Megacon

I was, and remain, very upset about the video/audio situation, especially
since I made a point of going to the area a few hours earlier (as some who
were sitting around waitinf for Peter's panel can testify) to check out
the equipment, and told everyone concerned that I didn't think it was
going to work out right, but they *insisted* that they'd tested it, and it
would be fine...and wouldn't change it...and, of course, it sucked.

I'm assured that, if I come there again, this will not happen again.  I
don't know if that's going to be a good enough guarantee, it may take a
little more than that next time.  

I love it when someone tries to say, "No, no, our experts and techs
checked it."  HEY!  I WORK IN TEEVEE!  I PRODUCE A SERIES!  I KNOW WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT DON'T TAKE ME FOR HAVING JUST FALLEN OFF THE TURNIP

"Have you ever had any problems writing a part for an actor you admire?"

Not really, since in 99% of all cases the program, whatever it is, is cast
*after* I turn in the script.  

"Have you ever been star struck?"

When we had Paul Williams, and Michael York...yeah, definitely.  And I
turned all fanboy, had Paul autograph 2 of my CDs for "Phantom of the
Paradise," and had York sign my laserdisk of "Cabaret."

"How do you deal with writing for people you greatly admire?"

See above.  It's usually after the fact.  In any event, I just write the
character, not the actor.

Of the choices given....

1. Too busy. Will get back when I'm not utterly snowed under.
2. Not feeling very well at the moment.
3. Haven't anything of interest to say right now. Thought I'd wait 
    until I had some news.
4. The questions being raised at the moment have already been 
    answered or aren't addressed to me.
5. Couldn't get my computer to post to the new address 
    (b5mod@deepthot.cary.nc.us.).
6. Other (please specify if it's not top secret).

It's 1, 3, and 4, with a little of 6 going on.  I'm just completely up to
my ass in alligators with production right now.  As usual, WB wants to
hold 4 episodes for October, but that means because they held back there's
going to be a big crunch of new shows in May sweeps.  Nine eps in a row. 
So we're busting our butts to get stuff ready.

They'll be airing 310 through 318 between April 18th and June 13th.  Which
will at least give us a big boost and ramp things up.

Yeah, the Starship Straczynski is in Jack's novel as a result of a charity

Re: 422...this one is a stand-alone episode which I specifically designed
in order to have the flexibility to air it either as 422 or as 522,
depending on what happens.  This way if year 4 is all there is, we get to
where we need to get; if we get year 5, then we shoot 501 and air it in
422's spot, and air 422 in place of 522.

And what you describe is exactly the approach I've already begun taking
with the books, and will continue to do so in future: using them to
explore the areas and things that are mentioned in the show but not
actually shown, background and foreground stories, linked to the history

Speaking of the Lucas thing in your list (reasonably funny, btw)....

When I was in Orlando for Megacon, on Sunday, I didn't want to spend the
whole time in the hotel, so I went out and had a perfectly awful night
(it's too awful for details)...and I got back around 10 p.m., figured I'd
go for a late dinner to the Sizzler's next door to the hotel.

Went in, wearing my B5 jacket, and as the guy shows me to my seat, he
says, "I know you...yessir, I know who you are."  

I mumbled something at him, the usual bit about being recognized, and he
continued.  "You're here for the convention, aren't you?"  So I allowed as
how I was....

"I knew it, I knew it," he said.  "You're one of them Trekkies."

The only thing that kept me from killing him was that I didn't know the
penalty for murder in Florida.

Subject: Re: Possible Tech-type Issues: EF Starship Questions

The answer in Real Life vs. Reel Life is substantially correct.  There
are always dramatic decisions to be made that can a) appeal to current
tech eyes, and b) satisfy our fixed budget. 

This is a hard line to walk, and we keep stepping over it in both
directions.  We keep asking questions, and following advice (thanks,
John!), but there are astill things that we do that simply look good,
and fit the story.  We are constantly improving even our stock shots,
though.  Notice the shuttle sequence in 410 now has retro fire in the
bay before main engine burn, and the main engines don't burn forever,
like they did before.  We had a reverse-burn (decelerating) transport
coming into Mars in 410 that was cut for time, leaving the "manouvering
to orbit shot" only (which, I'm sure, will get some people up in the
air, but hey- we can't buy the commercials!) We will continue to improve
the science we use as we go.

One of things we discussed substantially before we did it was the
rotating sections on the EA destroyers.  If we had locked them down, as
some say we should have, we would be having this discussion about magnet
shoes or something to explain why there were no floating folks in the
interior shots during engagement.  

As to explosive decompression, we have always postulated that anything
hit hard enough to have serious ED would probably be hard pressed to
sustain viable survivors.  I suspect that there will pressure suits used
in the short term and some Webb suit variant that will be used in the
mid term of outer travel.  We are not doing any "Nightflyers"- style
decompression gags in the near future, so we will not deal with that
issue yet.

Subject: Re: ATTN:JMS re:holding back final 4 eps till fall

Kids-

The WB MO has always been to hold some eps until the following season. 
The only thing that has happened here is that the post production
schedule has been moved up to allow a bigger block of new episodes in a
continuous string.  Sine the ratings for B5 always grow through a period
of new eps, imagine what will happen this time!

Geez, folks, you always blast us during reruns- why is it that giving a
bunch of new eps in a bunch is a trigger for much worry and speculation?

There has been NO official or unofficial decision on S-5 at this time. 
This occurance is independent of that decision.  That is not to say that
there hasn't been discussions...........
