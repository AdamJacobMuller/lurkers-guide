     Sherry...thank you.  The level of attention to detail is the *only*
way that this story will be told properly.  It means you sit down with the
director, and others, and you make totally clear -- there, and in the
script -- what you saw in your head when you wrote it.  As well as repeatd
verbal themes, cues, phraseologies, it's important (since this is a visual
medium) to incorporate visual cues that add to the thematic thrust of the
piece, that create a mood, or convey an emotion or a thought on an almost
cellular level.  The hardest part is being careful not to OVER use them,
because then they lose all meaning and impact.

Subject: Housecleaning Note from jms
Date: 4 Sep 1995 18:59:06 -0400

     A couple quick things I have to clarify for the record.
 
     1) I get over 500 messages a day, when the internet railway is
working (which it hasn't the last couple/three days).  No problem,
except when people send me 4, 6, or even 10 private email messages in a
day, asking questions that should more properly be asked in the public
forum.  Otherwise a) I end up answering the same question, privately,
over and over, b) I don't answer in which case I'm seen as snubbing the
person.  In particular, I'm often sent long, LONG messages requiring
very detailed discussions in private mail...and if I stopped to answer
all of those, nothing in the public forums would get answered, and no
scripts would be written.  And again I'm in the position of a or b above.
 
     If you have a question about story, or characters, or other B5
elements, unless there's some profound and overwhelming reason why you can
NOT let others see it, *POST IT IN THE PUBLIC FORUM* so that the discussion
can serve others who may have similar questions.  There is no reason why
that kind of discussion should be kept in private mail.  And if it's
public, it has a much better chance of getting a reply, or an in-depth
reply, than if it's private.
 
     Just trying to get some kind of handle on the huge incoming email
problem before I drown out here.
 
     2) Regarding the B5 snail-mail box...that address has been provided
as a drop for mail for the cast, primarily, and somewhat for myself.  It's
basically a fan-mail address.  But lately, more and more, people have been
sending in mail with story ideas, which my staff generally catch before I
see it.  The usual line in the letter is, "I know you said you couldn't see
story ideas in the public forums, so I thought I'd send this to you in
hard copy so you could consider it."
 
     NO, NO, NO, NO and, in case I wasn't clear....NO.
 
     One person even has begun sending *weekly packets* of stuff, and this
one's going to have to go to Legal Affairs to beat the crap out of him.
 
     The mail drop is provided, by me, out-of-pocket, as a courtesy to the
fans.  It is not to be abused.  If story ideas/outlines/scripts continue
to arrive -- they are currently being either round-filed or sent back
unopened, if we can tell what they are -- I will have no choice other than
to close the mail drop.
 
     I hate to be a grump about this stuff, but as more folks find the
show, correspondence-related matters threaten to spin out of control, and
it's important to kind of re-establish the ground rules a bit.  It's only
a relatively few folks who're not getting or haven't heard the message,
but it's worth stating for the record anyway.  So if this info could be
included in the faq, that'd be great.
 
     3) Quick aside...to the person who sent me the private mail about
candles...which I accidentally deleted and couldn't find again to reply...
the answer is yes, and thank you.
 
                                                                   jms

who you are...the question of, as you say, those who wish to accommodate
and give in to pressures from within and from without.
 
     Didn't want to be heavy-handed about it, so I figured those who got

Stewart Copeland (not John Copeland, who is our producer, though this is

the time to tour and try to work on an album.  He was not available to us.
 
     That said, I am *extremely* happy with Christopher Franke's work, and
think it adds immeasurably to the quality of the show.

     Each show does have its own budget, but they rarely vary much from

cost.  If we do one episode that's a huge blow-out, of course, we'll try
to make the next one a little less huge, just to be sensible.

     Whether it's "bland" or not depends on what the messsages might be,
yes?  The only thing I'll say for the episode is that it may be one of the
biggest whams of the first half of year three, and one of our most
ambitious episodes of the series.  Generally, my feeling is that titles
should augment the episode, or add something, or collapse something into
a thematic whole.  When you see what convictions are at hand, the episode
"Convictions" as a title works better; ditto for "Messages."
 
     Besides, a nice, quiet, inoffensive little title gives me a better
chance to sneak up behind you and whack the heck out of you....

different look and feel from anything we've done before.  Has kind of an
NYPD Blue feel to it.

     Mike: your assessment is pretty much correct.  Laurel was to be the
traitor initially; as I noted long, long time ago, and you quoted, she was
not, in fact, acting entirely under her own volition.  There would indeed
have been an implanted personality there, acting without even her knowing
about it.  And it would've been this implanted personality that would've
shot Garibaldi.
 
     When I took Laurel off the board, elements of this were transferred
to other characters.  This is the kind of thing I mean when I say that even
with changes here and there, the story continues to go where I want it to
go.  We don't necessarily remember *which* general put the briefcase with
a bomb next to Hitler's chair in the bunker, only that it got done.  Some
chairs are moveable, some are not, as anyone who's ever written a novel
from an outline can tell you...you start moving the chairs around, but you

     I cannot have any kind of informed opinion about the Roswell films,
since I have no more information than anyone else, which is to say, just
that which was presented in the Fox special.
 
     I can only make one observation: whenever we have had an alien
character in the show get wounded, and bleed, it's a hideously difficult
process, and you run point-to-point tubes with blood; it spurts from one
location, the spot where the tube ends.  (Just getting G'Kar's hand to
bleed in one of the final four eps was a pain in the ass.)
 
     The body upon which they performed the autopsy bled smoothly from the
entire surface of each cut and incision.  Even with the best prosthetics
available to us right now, we couldn't do this.  So if it's a fake, it's
the most clever one in history, and uses technology nobody else has yet.

Subject: jms - What time do you get up

     Unfortunately, in my case, I'm all over the map, depending on when
meetings are held...sometimes very early, sometimes later in the morning.
I'm usually up until at least 3 a.m. every night of the week, sometimes
as late as 4-4:30 a.m., so how much actual sleep I get is a very flexible
notion.
 
     As for the crew...crew call is 7 a.m. M-F, as a rule.  If an alien
is in the first scene, prosthetics crew can sometimes show up as early as
6:00 a.m.  Actors and crew actually hit the stage at 9 a.m.  (7-9 is spent
basically waking up, rigging lights, setting up cameras, other stuff.)
 
     We shoot until about 7 p.m., rarely any later.

Subject: Attn: JMS B5 franchise

     I can only reply to one message at a time, so this has to be a
public note, Greg.
 
     Yes, WB owns the copyright to B5.  Could they continue it past the
fifth year?  Technically, yes, they could, without my participation (though
as indicated, there's always been a side-story/alternate series, and that
would be the way to go, though I think the odds on that ever going ahead
are doubtful.)
 
     Which is why I made sure we shoved a bomb down B5's throat in the
early stages.  It's got a self-destruct mechanism built right into it.
 
     See, usually, when you make series deals with actors an
sub-contractors (like Foundating Imaging, our prosthetics people, others),
you go for 7 year options.  TNG, for instance, had 7 year options; as do
the other ST shows.  This is fairly standard.
 
     When we made the deals for B5, we made them...for five years.
 
     During those five years, salaries and fees are all set ahead of time.
This serves you well, in the sense that Foundation's name is already
growing, and somebody coming in now would have to pay more than we are,
also in part since we helped them get going.  Actors, once freed from the
pre-set salaries, on a hit show, come back and renegotiate.
 
     The result of all this...is that if WB wanted to do a sixth season
of B5, the costs of going back and making deals with all these people and
sub-contractors and others would be SO hideous, so terrible, that it
couldn't be done for anywhere near the money available.
 
     So, as stated...the show is designed to fiscally self-destruct at
the end of the fifth year.  What other projects may follow will have to
be totally separate situations, assuming they're done at all, which is
highly doubtful.
 
                                                                     jms

     You'll notice the doors are wedged, with overlapping, key-like
sections into which the doors settle.  When they close, the sound you hear
is the door sealing shut, and pins extruding into place to keep the door
shut (in the key-wedges).  That's also why they slide down, rather than
part in the middle; it's totally airtight in case of pressure falls.  So
yes, we *did* think of it, and took care of it, by thinking of a new way
to do the doors.

     Majel Barrett-Roddenberry and I got on quite well, as you note; we
set aside any prior misunderstandings and got on with it.  We hung out,
joked a lot together during autograph signings, had a late dinner (along
with Michael O'Hare and Ed Wasser), and she told the audience at her
presentations that she considered B5 the only other intelligent SF show
now on the air, suggesting that fans support the show.
 
     It was, overall, a very pleasant experience, problems with air
conditioning (or the lack thereof) notwithstanding.  The attendees were
great, polite and friendly and enthusiastic about the show...a most
impressive experience.  And the clips from upcoming year 3 episodes went
over *very* well, including a scene with Londo and G'Kar that is likely
my favorite of the series to date.  (Another scene with Londo and Lennier,
btw, contains a small nod to the online fans of the show; we can't and
won't use story ideas, but there's been so much humor, reams and reams

Subject: ATTN: JMS - SCRIPTS

     I always leave a fair amount of flexibility in the series/season
outlines; to do otherwise seems foolish.
 
     We don't generally do a lot of revisions.  Once in a great while
you'll get something that goes through 4 colors (drafts are color coded),
but they're rare.  And invariably *all* such drafts after the first are
mainly revised to handle set changes or production requirements, not
story, dialogue or other creative stuff.  This season, in all but one
case, I write the first draft, clean it up a bit for the second/final
draft, it goes into production, we adjust for sets ("Can we make this
the conference room instead of Sheridan's office so we can do it on the
same stage and avoid a camera move to stage in the middle of the day?"),
and it's filmed as written.
 
     There's often a perception -- I saw it again at Wolf 359 -- that
lots and lots of people have input into the writing of the script.  Not
so.  I write it alone.  Nobody sees nothin' until the first draft is
finished.  I then show it only to WB (which hasn't given me a single
script note since episode 4, year 2), producer John Copeland (who looks
at it for any possible production headaches, too many extras or sets,
other physical elements), my partner Doug Netter (who doesn't generally
give creative notes, as per our tradition), and if necessary, Ron at
Foundation, Optic Nerve, and the director.  A couple of cast members
like to look at first drafts, just out of curiosity to know what's
coming next, but don't give notes or suggestions.
 
     Once I have in hand any production hiccups, I clean up the draft a
bit, adjust the production, EFX or prosthetics elements, make my last
minute personal revisions on the script (dialogue, structure, whatever),
then it's published as a Final Draft which goes to everyone in the cast
and crew.  The various departments then begin work on realizing what's
in the script.  We have meetings to discuss it to make sure everyone's
on the same page.  I meet with the director to make the same assurances.
Last minute production-oriented changes are made ("Do we have a Ranger in
among the extras here?  Do we need 12 Narns or will 8 do?").
 
     And then the script hits the stage, and we shoot it.  As written.  If
an actor has a problem with a particular word, it can be changed after

slow-mo indications if necessary, lighting notes, you name it.
 
     Some scripts I tinker with a lot before issuing that first draft;
others blow right out of the printer as though pre-written.  Sometimes
the most important ones are the ones that need or get the least revision,
because I see them the most clearly; and often it's the more trivial
episodes that seem to require lots of finessing.

which is: that he had no first-hand information at all about the O'Hare
situation, and was operating off what he'd assumed to be the case (we had
never really discussed it, as he'd moved on to other projects long before
any of this happened).
 
     He asked me to apologize on his behalf to anyone who might have been
caught up in this because of his speculations.  Anyone who wants
confirmation of this can drop him a note, or as stated, he's willing to

     I've always liked the name Theo, from Vincent's brother, so there
was the sound of it; also the sense of it, in that Theo was a guide, a
counselor, a confidante, which Theo might come to be in this; and, finally,
Theodore means (I just lapsed on the actual definition) but either chosen
(favored) of god or messenger of god (have to check my dictionary of names
again), which is appropos.

Subject: Attn. JMS Naive query about se

     The script never technically leaves my hands.  Once the final draft
is written, it's given to every department, which breaks it down in terms
of set, extra, day-player, EFX, music, sound and other requirements.  We
have visual effects, art department and other meetings to go over what's
in the script and make sure we all understand what's required.  Any new
designs for prosthetics, costumes, EFX, ships, or other episode-specific
elements are drafted, and shown to me for approval.
 
     The script department breaks down the script in terms of shooting
schedule, timing of scenes, and arranges a production board indicating
which scenes will be shot on which days  (Based on which sets are being
used; you don't shoot in sequence...you do all the C&C scenes done on day
1, then move into the Zocalo for all those scenes, and so on.)
 
     The director and I have a tone meeting to go over the script page by
page.  At this time, the director sometimes suggests changes in locales
for production purposes, though this often happens earlier in the process.
 I make sure we both understand what each scene is about, context and
subtext.  Then there's a production meeting of all departments, where we
all go through one last time and break down each scene of the script by
what's required.
 
     The director then takes the script to the stage, and shoots what's
written.  Dailies arrive each day thereafter, and go to post production,
where an editor does a preliminary assembly of the episode.  If the
episode appears to be coming in long, we have the option of trimming a
scene here or there in shooting...or expanding if it's coming in short.
 
     After 7 days of shooting, the raw film is complete, and the editor
gives the director his assembly.  The director then comes in and takes
about 3-4 days making his or her cut.  The director's cut then goes to
me, and John Copeland and I go in to make the producer's cut, often
re-editing every single frame, though sometimes less, depending on many
different factors.  This is done on computers, the Avid.
 
     This final edit is then used to assemble the actual film (we take the
Avid computer disk and turn it over to a supercomputer which assembles the
film overnight).  Using this online copy, I now sit down with the composer,
and sound people, and watch it again, going through it and noting where
sound effects and music are required, and what kind I have in mind.  "In
at 03:13:18 (three minutes, 13 seconds, 18 frames), out at 04:14:22.  I'd
like something soft, strings mainly, underscoring that doesn't get in the
way...with a tone change at 04:05:13, into the action, and since we've got
a lot of combat going on there, we need you to clear out the low-end for
the battle stuff."
 
     Composer and sound EFX people then do their thing, and a couple weeks
later, we do the audio mix.  (During this time, Ron and company have
delivered the last of their CGI.)  At the audio mix, all of the final
elements are inserted/layered in, including any last-minute looping or
dubbing.  This done, the episode is delivered to PTEN about 5 days later.
 
     Total time to complete an episode (after the last day of filming per
se): 52 days.

Subject: ATTN: JMS - More on Scripts

     "So why do you rush your work out the door?"  I don't.  The script
takes the amount of time needed to get it right.  Sometimes I take 7-10
days to write a script.  Sometimes I do it in just a couple of days; and
often, the 2-3 days jobs are actually better because it's done in white
heat, with the image clearest in my mind.
 
     In television, you can't take 6-8 weeks or even 2 weeks to turn in a
script; it's got to be done on a schedule; remember, you're using up one
script every 7 days, and you have to have scripts in hand 3 in advance
minimum for proper prep work.
 
     "I find input from my writing group to be very helpful."  I don't.
I've been writing professionally for 23 years now (started at 17), full
time for the last 17.  I know what I want to say, and how I want to say
it.  Does a sculpter go to a sculpting group and say, "Y'know, I think I
see a horse in this bit of clay, but I'm not sure, what do the rest of
you think?"  An artist follows the dream or the vision that is in his or
her head.  There's this notion that writing is somehow different; it ain't.
 
     Nothing decent has been done by committee since Stonehenge and the
pyramids.

     The group critiquing process may be, and likely is, useful when one
is an art major or learning to write or draw.
 
     Then you have to leave that nest and fly on your own.  The whole
PURPOSE of workshops and critiquing should be to help you find your own
voice (for a writer) or your own eye and style (if an artist).  It should
help you make the work more muscular, and less artificial...peeling away
the layers until just the individual stands there, saying *exactly* what
he wants to say.  The group isn't there to make you write like the group,
or please the group; it's there as a means of finding your own voice.
 
     Once you've found it, you have to walk away.  Otherwise the whole
endeavor has been for nothing.
 
     Back in college, I took two writing workshops led by Richard Kim, a
transplanted Korean novelist, very well regarded.  I learned a *hell* of a
lot.  I signed up for a third semester.  Now, mind, I liked  the class,
we liked each other, it was good.  FIrst day of class, he looked out,s aw
me, and said, "Go.  You've learned all you can learn.  Don't take any more
workshops, from me or anybody else here.  You have the tools, now find your
voice.  If you stay here, you'll risk losing it."  At the time, I felt
as though it were a rejection, but over time I began to understand what he
was talking about.

Subject: Re: Jeannette announces JMS' B

     When we first announced casting Walter Koenig on B5, lots of people
moaned, "Oh, no, not Chekov on B5."  What you got was Bester, who has
become one of our most noted and discussed characters.  It's unfortunate,
but some people confuse the role with the person.  "...the worst character
ever in the entire ST universe" has nothing to do with the person, or the
role she will be portraying: the Lady Morella, Emperor Turhan's third
wife, a prophetess and seer.  It's a *very* serious, significant role,
absolutely unlike anything she's done before.
 
     This, btw, is called "typecasting," which is one of the primary
reasons why so many talented actors who helped to create Star Trek and
other series couldn't get work for so many years...they did so good a
job that they forever *became* that character.  Let's not be guilty of
that crime here.  Majel's character will no more be Troi than Bester is
Chekov.
