No, in writing my play now, and in those I've written before, I generally just
write it the way I hear it, and it's up to the actors to find a way to make
that work.  (If something absolutely falls on its face and doesn't work and
it's the fault of the words, however, then you gotta fix it.)

As for question 2...understand that there isn't a frame of B5, or a page, that
I wouldn't keep tinkering with ad infinitum.  Every time I look at ANYthing
I've done, I always want to go back and tweak something.

As somebody once said: art is never finished, only abandoned.

Nope.  The contract has been sent to me for signing several times, and each
time it has had some problem or another that needed fixing.  (See, this is how
the process works: your agent and the studio negotiate over the phone.  Come to
terms.  Deal memos go out, which often don't reflect the conversations, but
they hope you won't notice.  You catch the "errors" and send back the memos. 
Next come the actual contracts, and sonuvagun, more "errors" have slipped
through, and now THEY need to be corrected, if you can find them in the 90
pages of 8 point type.  So that's been the only real holdup.  It's standard.)

Our first two seasons were roughly 40-50% freelance, which is a substantially
higher average than most shows.  Years 3 and 4 were mine, mainly because of the
difficulty in farming out stories in that situation.

Crusade will almost certainly to back to the 40-50% freelance mode, which is

done.

I've always tried to deal with issues that matter to me in what I write.  I
can't do it any other way.  If you pull out any of my work, from whatever show,
I try to sneak in the issues that get caught in my filter.  Hell, it's even in
the animated series I wrote.  

I was with friends recently, and just for (as John Copeland says) shits and
grins, I fired up an old episode of He Man a few weeks ago, which was my first
TV staff writing gig of any substance.  I picked up "Origin of the Sorceress." 
And the friends commented that virtually all of the themes in B5 are right
there in that one episode.  Not the plot, the characters, none of that...the
*themes*, the points of personal sacrifice, responsibility, on and on.

I believe, very strongly, that TV should not be just entertainment.  It must
entertain, yes, because if it doesn't entertain ain't nobody gonna watch
it...but as Mark Twain said, while it must not overtly preach or overtly teach,
it must *covertly* teach and covertly preach.

It's there in about 95% of all my work...especially on The Twilight Zone, and
in other shows to varying extents.  I don't tend to do moral shows -- if you
haven't figured out by now that racism is bad, a TeeVee show ain't gonna teach
it to you -- but I do try to do ethical shows, which get people to talk about
what's at issue.

No matter how dopey the show, as long as you approach it with, as Balzac said,
"clean hands and composure," and tell the stories that matter to you, about the
issues that count, the work is valid.

Those (actors, writers, directors) are all above-the-line people.  The

carpenters, costumers, others.  Most of the company consists of regular

People are fascinating by what they do or say, you can't have a character who's
fascinating but does nothing, so it's kind of a moot point.

But in general, plot proceeds from character...it's from defining who the
character is, what he wants, how far he's willing to go to get it, and how far
someone else will go to stop him.  From that comes all the rest.

On every season, and on every one of the TV movies, we have come in a bit under
budget.  Every time.  Not by skimping, really, but simply by planning properly.
 

See, I have this silly notion that if somebody gives you $21 million bucks or
so to make a series, it kinda behooves you to act responsibly.  

A little over $100 million will have passed through this company in making 5
years and 3 movies of B5...and every dollar has been accounted for, well spent,
and handled with sufficient responsibility that WB has gotten back its
underbudget on each season.  We have periodic audits, as with every production
company working with a studio, and they're gone within a few hours of arriving,
proclaiming our books the best they've ever seen.  

It's responsibility, a concept not often understood on this end of the coast.

There isn't any part of it that I think I've totally whipped...and I hope I
never do, because the moment you think you've got it all sussed, you've stopped
trying, and the work stultifies.

So there isn't really any one area, just a general sense that I have to
continue to get better...and the only way you get better is to keep trying new
things, in different combinations.

The first two definitely; the third is a bit of a stretch, though it may be my

"what do you want?" question is echoed over and over...as it would later be
echoed all over by Morden.  If you go back over the actual logic of how the

Kosh often tended to get revised in-house to make him consistent, mysterious
rather than a fortune-cookie, which often happened.

Writers got variously verbal notes, a page or two, or in some cases, several
pages of notes/outline material on an episode.  But a script is very long, so
they had to come up with a lot to fill in the gaps.

The daily ratings have been substantially higher in both number, and in the
demographics, which is crucial for advertisers who want to reach a specific
audience.  L&C did about a 1.4 or 1.5 average, which they'd be happy if B5
reached or equaled.  The first 3 B5 eps of this week, for instance, all I have
so far for this week, were all 2.0...so TNT is delerious.

This is hardly a new plot element...this has been brewing for 4 years now, with

Sheridan and Bester about the coming telepath war?

No, Edgars wasn't trying to *start* a war, he was trying to solve it BEFORE it

edge.  That edge is now gone.  Again, you're misinterpreting or misremembering

Individually, yes...but again, pay attention, we're talking about a COLONY,
which means you've got several hundred people living in one area, under one
authority (Byron), with an unknown or unspecified agenda, whose presence might
bring problems from the Psi Corps and elsewhere.  So yeah, they're going to
need somebody's permission.

He didn't break his promise...he moved this into a political decision, which is
his purview.  He said specifically, "If it's a political problem, or involves
the Alliance, it's my turf."  This is a strategic decision on behalf of the
Alliance.

Well, now you've got a contradiction.  Either we have seen this before, or we
haven't seen it before.  You say where did it come from, then cite an example
of where it's been seen before.  And if you'll go back and rewatch that
episode, you'll see that teeps can act collectively and be very strong.

No...again, you're distorting the situation.  The task wasn't just to send an
image into his head, it was to CONVINCE HIM that this image had really
happened, and it took a lot of them to do this to a Psi Cop.  That's why it
took so many of them; he's a strong target.  It ain't the same as doing it to a
normal.  You're not thinking through what you're saying.

No, he wasn't...they had to drug him, and do all kinds of work on him to make

Maybe because they are (or are trying to be) the good guys?  Maybe because they
don't actually vanish, or turn off sound, they can individually manipulate
somebody by pressing on receptors and distorting things like their time
sense...but they're going to show up on cameras, and on sensors, and unless
they want to constantly try and control every single person on the station in
large groups as they pass by, they're going to be discovered, and booted off
the station.  So they may as well do the right thing and ask.  Just because
someone *can* steal doesn't mean they *should* steal.

Besides, where are they going to live?  Quarters have to be assigned, and
they're always short on space.  Food has to be paid for.  On and on.  Your
contention doesn't make sense...they're not gods.

Because there other opinions out there, and in the case of ItB you are

Excuse me, folks, but he was using a B5 starfury, which is programmed like all

docking, ejecting, and holding position for repair purposes.  All a pilot would
have to do is tell the on-board computer to sync up the thrusters with the

This is a no-brainer...which is why I didn't specify it in dialogue (also it
