Subject: ATTN JMS:  Larry DeTillio leav

     There's really not much *to* tell.  Because I wrote 15 out of 22 this
season, and I held virtually all of the writers meetings, and personally
created and handed out the stories to freelancers, there wasn't a lot for
him to *do*; he spent a lot of time when he wasn't doing his scripts
more or less sitting on his hands.  Larry's a world-builder, coming from
a gaming background, and this world was already built.  There wasn't that
much for him to do, and his skills were being wasted.  He'd never have a
chance to shine and come out from under the jms shadow to be recognized
for what he can do.  (Very often, stuff in his scripts would get credited
to me, often incorrectly.)  This situation would only get worse in later
seasons, with more and more arc stories, pre-determined, coming into the
foreground.  So it was really for the best.

Subject: Re: Attn: JMS - C&L and QoM -

     It should also help in all these discussions to remember the
way the machine functions; it's not so much an alien HEALING device as an
alien LIFE TRANSFERRAL device.  If someone is actually dying, or close to
it, the only way to save that person is to take the life from someone
else.  So you really don't gain anything (which was why they used
condemned murderers for the original device).

     Okay, folks, CALm DOWn.  Ch 4 hasn't gotten the last batch yet
only because we're finishing the last bits of tweaking.  "Twilight" is
totally finished.  "Divided Loyalties" is getting the final EFX put in
this week, and will probably be delivered to WB on Friday.  (This would
be the first up of the last batch.)  "Confessions" is finished and scored
absent 2 EFX shots, which will be in tomorrow, and we'll probably deliver
on Monday/Tuesday, with "The Fall of Night" delivered about a week after
that.  They'll have the episodes in time to play them.

Subject: Technobabylon

     Michael, you're confusing your terms.  You can't say that because
B5 has rotational artificial gravity that therefore this equals
technobabble.
 
     Science fiction -- note, SCIENCE fiction -- relies on elements of
technology.  You cannot have SF without some element of changed or
new technology.  Thus your notion that ANY technology = technobabble
means that ALL SF is technobabble.  In so doing, the term loses all
meaning.
 
     Technobabble specifically refers to paragraph after paragraph of
dialogue explaining how the neutrino filters invert the tachyon field
distancing array and corrupt the magnetic flow systems into an inert
state...which is later solved by MORE technobabble.  The operative word
here is BABBLE, which in this case means to go on and on.

Just a slight delay, a couple/three weeks...hey, could be worse, could

Subject: Why are you here (rastb5)?

     The notion that I'm asking for no story ideas to be posted so that I
can rip off story ideas is the most lame-brain statement I have heard in
10+ years of being on the nets.  Saying "no story ideas" doesn't kee
anyone from suing; it just keeps useable ideas out of where I can see them,
period.
 
     I have said, often, and repeatedly, and clearly, why I am here.  The
problem is that you have one or two absolute mindless conniving distrustful
fuckheads who have no perceivable life other than to try and ride my ass
about one thing or another, swinging from one stupid theory to another to
another with as much astonishing speed and illogic as the Simpson defense
team.  They will seize upon anything, ANYthing, and try and twist it around
to try and convince others that somehow, somewhichway, I'm getting away
with something, I'm conning people, I'm lying, I'm actually Reichminister
Goebbels who set up a twin for the little WW II misunderstanding and am
currently trying to sneak back into the United States disguised as Rondo
Hatton.
 
     Loonies and feebs and creeps, oh my.
 
     Okay, you want it straight up?  Here it is.  I'm here for a number of
reasons.  1) I like to get kind of a sense of the room; I'm not going to
change anything, but writing for TV is like writing for a vacuum; you nevr
(never) get to see the reaction.  This is the ONLY chance I get to get a
reaction to something I've written and produced, and maybe it's ego, maybe
it's just that I work very hard to make something effective,and want to see
if it had the desired effect.  Writers and artists and singers are like
that.
 
     2) I think that TV producers in general get a very skewed sense of
who's in the audience.  This exchange gives access to people across the
country to someone who makes TeeVee, and lets me hear them.  How often
would someone in Clearwater, Oklahoma, have the chance to express an
opinion to someone in LA making a TV series?  Not bloody often.  And that
is in large measure, I think, why TV has become so insular.  And so
unresponsive to its audience.  So I'm kind of a test-case volunteer for
this, in the hopes of luring more producers onto the nets and creating a
more open exchange, making producers accountable for what they make.
 
     3) I've dedicated over 15 years of my life to trying to demystify
TV production and writing.  I've written columns and columns, reams of
articles, a book...all trying to help people understand how this medium
works, because you can't control or influence something unless you truly
UNDERSTAND it...why things are done a certain way.  This is part of an
educational project that I've been doing for over a decade, a natural
outgrowth of that process.  By the time this is all done, there will be
an online document of hundreds of archival pages -- maybe thousands --
covering the development, birth and ongoing creation of a TV series at a
depth never before chronicled, which will be available to students and
universities and ordinary folks.  I think that's a valuable experiment.
 
     Finally: 4) I'm an SF fan.  I think SF fans are, overall, the most
exploited bunch around.  They're expected to line up, buy the toys,
watch the show and shut the hell up.  I think it's time some respect for
that audience was shown by allowing them a voice.  This is part of my
sense of personal obligation to the field that spawned many wonderful
years of reading.
 
     My request has always been just that, a request, and a simply stated
one.  You can talk about story ideas all you want.  But I simply cannot be
here if you do that.  I will not run the risk of being sued, or having the
show that I've labored over for, now, eight years being victimized by some
crazed yahoo who posts something and then decides I've ripped him off,
despite the fact that this material has been sitting in my computer for
YEARS.  And a Crazed Yahoo (tm) doesn't have to win, doesn't even think
he may have a chance to win...but defending a case can run hundreds of
thousands of dollars, thanks to our wonderful legal system, and can tie
up episodes for years.
 
     You cay some of these people think the chances of a lawsuit are
"ignorable."  Yeah, for them.  They're not the ones at risk.  If they're
wrong, it's "Oh, huh, guess I was wrong."  For me it's several years of
courtrooms, lawyers, depositions and the like.  It's frankly not their
call to make.  It's mine.  Warners knows I'm here, and I periodically
have to reassure them that I'm keeping the promise about not exposing the
show to risk.  And I have to maintain that stance, or vanish.
 
     I would remind a very few of the feebs I noted before that in fact,
there WAS no rec.arts.b5 area until I showed up on the alt group.  At
that point, membership jumped *dramatically* enough to merit the
formation of a rec.arts group.  I have no particular infatuation with my
own sense of importance -- much the contrary -- but I do know that my
being here is in many ways directly responsible for there BEING a
B5 rec group.  Now I'm being told, "Hey, why make special rules for him,
who cares, let him blow off if he doesn't like it."
 
     Not a special rule.  Just courtesy.  Plain and simple.  Why is it
that one can no longer simply make a request out of courtesy?  Instead one
must now back it up with lengthy treatises about legalities and laws and
risk factors...and one's own personal motivations are challenged and
questioned and suspected and put on trial and smeared by a callous few to
whom the very concept of "courtesy" is a foreign idea, and who exist only
to bring grief to me and the bulk of users here.  There are PLENTY of
ways for people to suggest story ideas to one another without exposing
them to me...email lists, private groups, whatever.
 
     The theory, as I understand it, is that people are coming up with
story ideas because they like the show.  Why, therefore, would they
choose to *endanger* the show by posting them where I can see it?  I had
this recently with a fanzine publisher who turned down a B5 fictional
story because I'd asked, politely, that none be published until after the
show had ended.  The writer got very upset and said, "Well, who CARES what
he wants?"  The side-product was more important than the creation that
spawned it.
 
     I've made my motivations clear from day one.  Anyone who wants to
challenge them can go fuck themselves, I don't have to answer to them or
give them any credence whatsoever by even acknowleging them.  It's in all
the faq files from the beginning; let them go do some research, it's all
there.  They pick on this today; tomorrow they'll move onto something
else, because they don't actually CARE about the truth.  They care about
being hyenas, and biting at people who didn't bow down and kiss their
respective asses.
 
     And frankly, that to me has become one of the most wearing aspects of
being online; the wackos and creeps who just live to make trouble.  For
that reason alone, I sometimes think, "Fuck it, I don't need this, I don't
need to go to bed angry, I don't need the distraction when I'm trying to
write, I'm doing this to do a Nice Thing.  Period.  And if all I'm going
to get is a few relentless assholes bitching at me 24 hours a day, then
the hell with it."  Then the sane part of me remembers that the word FEW
appears in that sentence.  And that these few jerks are irrelevant, despite
their attempts to create relevancy for themselves by attacking others.  And
I calm down, and after a bit, log back on again.
 
     To continue the experiment, as outlined above.
 
     And that's the sum and substance of it.  It's really a question of
which people prefer: having access to the producer of Babylon 5, or
blowing out huge story ideas.  There can be one, but not the other.  It
ain't the best case scenario, but it's the only workable one.  It's my show
that would be at risk otherwise, and I'm sorry, but on that count noboty
(nobody) else gets a vote.  Nobody else is entitled to determine the
risk factor, or determine if it's relevant.  That's my call.  And should
enough people decide their story ideas are what they really want to
discuss, or even a few (it only takes a couple to pose sufficient risk),
then I'll simply have to fade outta here.
 
     Because the experiment will continue, on other systems.  Compuserve,
GEnie, others...where the understanding is respected, and courtesy rises
above self-interest or unwarranted personal attacks.  And AS HAS BEEN THE
CASE HERE, I should point out, since this thing began.  If a few people
want to change that, well, that's their right.  I just can't be here if
it happens.  That simple.
 
     And yes, you can repost this, but if you do in the public forums,
do so in toto.  The usual band of self-styled critics/hatchet folks will
get all bent out of shape because I used a couple naughty words here and
there, and because I got all bent out of shape simply because they did
something as innocuous as impugning my motives and implying theft on a
daily, consistent basis, but y'know what?
 
     Fuck 'em.
 
                                                                  jms

Subject: Why are you here (rastb5)?

     A postscript to my previous note.  I debated including this, because
it sounds self-serving, but it also happens to be the truth, so after
thinking about it, I'm going to add it anyway.
 
     I don't get paid to be here.  Nobody asked me to be here.  Nobody's
forcing me to be here.  (And a few here would, apparently, love nothing
more than to drive me off here so they can say whatever they want without
the inconvenience of the target for their attacks disagreeing with them
with anything as unfair as facts.)  I'm a voluntee
 
     I am, insofar as I know, the ONLY television producer to be on-line
to this extent, creating what is really an interactive experience.  This
is a great experiment, one which will probably go down in the record
books when people look back at the history of the net.  There have already
been huge articles about this in books and magazines.  We're pioneering
something here.  And a lot of other producers I know are looking on to see
how this all shakes out.  If it works, others will come on-line.  If not,
if they're just going to get hammered and slandered and abused, they're
not.
 
     Maybe the problem is...I'm free.  And you respect something to the
extent you pay for it.  My consulting fees are in excess of $100 per
hour.  I spend 3 hours per day just on the internet.  That's 21 hours a
week, 2 and a half work days per week.  Most of that I spend not in
forwarding my own ego, or selling merchandise, or making money...I spend
it answering questions.  Who was this actor?  What did this mean?  Why
are CGI used?  How long does it take to make an episode?  What does a
producer do?  How do you write a character?  How do you sell a show?
 
     It's the kind of information you can't get anywhere else unless you
want to take one of those triple-damned McKee seminars and spend, oh,
about $500 for one weekend doing so.  I read and I read, 500 messages per
day slip past me, some in detail, some less so.  I provide a service.  I
provide information.  I answer questions.  I don't do it for the ratings,
beause if you added up all the people who read this group, which I think
is about 10,000 people, they won't even show UP on the Neilsen ratings.
 
     I do it, in addition to the reasons given a moment ago, to provide a
service.  Were I providing this service to a studio, or as a consultant
on another project, it would cost them a couple thousand bucks a week.  I
do all this without asking for money, or gifts, or even respect (he said
with a glance to the people riffling their papers in the back of the room
and tossing spitballs).  I have only ever asked for *one thing* in exchange
for this service: no story ideas.
 
     And I honestly don't think that's a terribly high price for the hours
and days I spend here when I should be writing, or trying to relax a bit,
or maybe going out to dinner once in a while.  I'm chained to the keyboard
when I write scripts; and then volunteer to stay up here, until 2 or 3 or
even 4 a.m., dead-tired, answering one more ATT: JMS note, because I think
maybe, just maybe, it's important, and right, and honorable, and
respectful.  I don't think most folks understand what this takes out of me
on a daily basis.  And I suppose they shouldn't have to.  It's not their
problem.  It's my choice.  I don't even like bringing it up, because it
sounds self-serving.  But with all this going on, I figured maybe it
SHOULD get mentioned.  Because it's the truth.
 
     Anyway, enough.  It's now 2:03 a.m., and I have 248 Internet messages
in my mailbox to get through before I crash tonight.
 
                                                                  jms

Subject: Re: Someone's Impersonating jm

     Only because it's late, and I'm kinda pissed off anyway (see the note
which Vinay will be reposting any time now), let me dive into this with one
or two comments which, I hope, will end this discussion.
 
     (And I won't even mention my sense that those who seem least to
understand the need to protect one's name are the ones who don't have much
of a name TO protect.)
 
     Lemme bring you up to speed on something a few of you know about, but
the majority probably don't.  There have been a couple of other cases of
people impersonating me.  One of the most serious was someone who, saying
he was me, using my address, began logging onto certain sex-oriented
alt and rec groups and began leaving messages that were...disturbing, to
couch it delicately.  Suffice to say they involved minors and let it go
at that.  I found out about this when messages in response to this began
showing up in my mailbox.  Other equally disturbing messages were brought
to my attention by a few others here who log onto some of the other parts
of the internet.  (They can step forward if they so choose.)
 
     One of these individuals is now facing criminal charges.
 
     Lawyers brought into this made it *absolutely clear* to me, in NO
uncertain terms, how this should be dealt with.  At the first hint, I must
send the person a message asking to cease and desist.  This will help to
root out which are impersonators with fake addresses, and which are real
people with the same name.  I note someone here (in a reply quoting it)
bitched, "Well, why didn't Joe try to contact this person here?"  I did,
you idiot.  And the message bounced back.  At that point, Orders From
Lawyers #2 kicked in.  You must hit them as hard as you can, as fast as
you can, as publicly as you can.  Don't wait.  If it turns out to be
benign, you can always apologize later.  If you DON'T, any time that you
don't respond but know what's going on can be taken as permission or
agreement.
 
     Two great ironies strike me here: 1) that one or two of the people
who have most implied that maybe this isn't really me (one of the ten
zillion nutty conspiracy notes they flash around) seemed to find no

further fuzzy up what's me and what's not. 2) Citing the person who got
accidentally bombarded with notes, a situation which BEGAN with a threat
of a harrassment lawsuit aimed against me (something which the person

     I don't care if it's automated.  I don't care if it's a person.  I
have a name, and a reputation to protect.  Naming a bot morden.bot is not
the same thing as jms.bot because jms is a real person and morden is not.
It has the same end result of blurring the lines.
 
     In any event, there has to be a forceful, hard response at ANY time
an impersonator emerges or seems to emerge, as fast as possible, because
of several other rather ugly incidents that have taken place.  And if
ANYbody has a problem with that, I really don't care, because it's my name
and reputation that's at stake here, not yours.

Subject: JMS: Music tastes?

     Actually, I listen to just about every kind of music there is, except
hard-core country-western, which I can't abide.  I have a fairly large
collection of music, and stuff goes in and out depending on my mood and
what I'm writing.  In rock, I'm partial to Peter Gabriel, Phil Collins,
Melissa Etheridge, Meatloaf, Indigo Girls, Billy Joel, Enya, Slade and
a lot of others.  I always go for strong individual voices and strong
writing.  I'm a sucker for the kind of music that makes you start pounding
your arm on the arm of your chair and makes the hair on the back of your
neck stand up.  Bonnie Tyler stuff.
 
     Other than that...classical, a *little* new wave, Celtic, Japanese
(KODO music in particular), Aboriginal music, medeival music, jazz,
big-band (LOTS of big band), musicals, soundtracks...you name it.

     Yeah, there was one thing I didn't get, only because those involved

Dark" was supposed to be one HELL of a lot more impressive than it was.
I really wanted to see something extraordinary.  What we got...wasn't
it.  That's the only case that I can remember.  PTEN has never come to us
and said, "Joe...it's too weird."  Performance wise, I think the part of
Inspector Cranston in "Hunter/Prey" could've been better executed.  But
overall, I have to say I'm very satisfied.

Subject: Re: ATTN JMS: Have You Gotten

     "That admission was impressive!"  (Ross Bench)
 
     Not really.  Kinda wish it was, but it ain't.
 
     You have to understand, for all the criticisms on this or any other
net, there is nobody -- NOBODY -- harder on this show than we who make it.
 Nobody gets spared.  Opinions are not withheld.  This is a show where
one of my producers, John Copeland, for instance, can walk into my office
after getting a new script and say, "Joe...it sucks."  (Most notably,
this happened on the first draft of "Soul Hunter," which I knew didn't
work as soon as I finished it, but still put it into the pipeline because
I wasn't sure of my own opinion at that very early stage in the first
season, decided I was right after all, and yanked back the script from all
parties with a note simply explaining that I had been momentarily
possessed by an idiot.)  We're all very open about this stuff.
 
     What I guess maybe doesn't always come through is that if you ask me
a straightforward question about the show, or behind the scenes, I'll
give you a straightforward answer.  I've never been big on politics or
self-preservation.  Which ep disappointed me with the EFX?  The Long
Dark.  Which do I consider my worst ep?  Infection, and it's entirely
my fault; if it ain't on the page, it ain't on the stage.  Is there
anything I'd like to re-do?  Yeah, probably parts of Voice 2.
 
     Happily, of all the stuff we've done, there's only about 5-10% that
sometimes glitches.  Mostly, it's light years beyond anything I could have
hoped for.  And lemme tell you...in advance...for those who thought "The
Coming of Shadows" was something, I've seen the final version of "The Long,
Twilight Struggle," and it's even better.  Better than "Z'ha'dum."  It's
probably the best we've done.  I've poked and prodded that one all over,
and it's solid.

     I never see Fulleristic messages directly, because I kill the notde

quote in Wayne Humfleet's message about DF calling the B5 production
office...I'm pleased to see that admission.  Basically, the call was to
complain to the office about me, read what I'd been writing on the nets
in answer to DF's attempts at glossalalia (not *entirely* sure I spelled
that right), in an attempt to make trouble and get me off the nets.
 
     This is the difference between us.  I do not call her office, or her
school, or her employers, to complain about the nutty, libelous thnigs
(things...fingers are tired) she says here.  But folks like her, and a
few others, because they can't win on the merits of their arguments, they
seek to shut the other person down.  They fax complaints to Warner Bros.,
they call my place of work and complain.
 
     It is, frankly, the very lowest form of net behavior I've ever seen.
If you can't win, try and silence the opposition.  But hey, it worked for

aboard, the elves at Optic Nerve will generally come up with several or

prefer, I go with that one, unless I feel strongly otherwise.  Other
times they have no real preference.  Once approved, they proceed apace,
and I'll see it one more time when the sculpture's finished, then not
again until it's on the stage.

Subject: ATTN JMS: How's the finale?

     How does the finale compare?  Hmmm...depends on what you're looking
for.  "Inquisitor" is primarily a character piece, virtually no EFX, but
very intense.  The story is kind of straightforward, with a few kickers
along the way.  "Twilight" is a heavy story episode, that zips all over
the B5 landscape, between the Narns, the Centauri, and elsewhere (he said
vaguely).  The finale, "The Fall of Night," is actually kind of deceptive;
it starts out fairly calmly and tightens fairly fast.  The story is not
as back-and-forth or layered as Twilight or Coming, it's really about one
thing.  Visually, it's the most ambitious thing we've done to date, and
probably the most ambitious EFX stuff done for a TV series *ever*.  I
don't think you'll feel left wanting after the episode is done.

Subject: ATTN JMS: Who speaks for you h

     Well....erm...uhm...*I* speak for me.
 
     And some folks, who remember what I said, sometimes repeat it.
 
     Unlike those who simply ignore it, or distort it.
 
     What gets me is when somebody says, "Well, who are YOU to post here to
defend him?"  Well, who are YOU to post here and attack?  Everybody's an
equal when it comes to speaking up.  If one can make someone else's
business your own enough to attack, how is that different from making
someone else's business one's own enough to defend?  This is absolutely
illogical, and can only, I assume, proceed from a desire to have me respond
personally to them.  Which I have absolutely no intention, or desire, to
do.  You will note the very important sentence that comes up frequently:
"If what I wrote wasn't important, then why all these reactions?"
 
     That's the key, and it's very sad.  To respond directly, WHATEVER you
might say, creates the sense that they are important.  And they LIKE that.
The more furor, the more angry messages get provoked, the more important
they feel.  If you respond directly, you're doing *exactly* what they
want you to do, and feeding the fire, and soon the conversation becomes
about the conversation, rather than the substance that provoked it, and it
spirals off and away into madness.
 
     They are petty, and venal, and I have absolutely nothing to say to
them.  If others choose to talk to them, well, why should they complain,
since it's that very action that makes them feel important?  It's a logical
contradiction.
 
     But then, logic has *nothing* to do with this.
 
                                                                    jms

Subject: Re: Are B5 Scripts Available?

     Recognizing that some folks would like to examine the scripts (hell,
if I were out there, I'd be kinda curious), once the B5 Fan Club gets up
and running (we're nearly there to getting the darned thing approved after
negotiating with WB for nearly a year), there are plans afoot to release a
limited number of B5 scripts for sale through this venue, so they're
properly authorized and complete.
 
     The word "complete" is important because in, oh, 95% of the cases,
some dialogue ends up on the cutting room floor.  Sometimes it's only a
few lines or words, sometimes it's a short scene, or several paragraphs
worth of dialogue which add to the scene, but when we got into editing,
felt weren't *absolutely necessary* (and we're always long on our eps,
from my sense that it's better to have more story than time than more
time than story).  (And no, expanded episodes won't ever be available on
tape or disk.)  All that material will be available in these scripts.
 
     Give us another couple months on this one.

[In reply to:

 Holy Valen! So the warrior caste has been ticked off for 1,000 years.  No
 wonder they're so scary.  They've held a grudge against Valen for that
 long. Now all their scoffing at the prophecy and the religious caste
 makes sense.  Personally, I think these guys killed Dukhat to ruin
 Valen's prophecy  -- Revenge motivation (of course the humans could have
 gotten VERY lucky and I'm wrong).
 
 Delenn refuses to help the Children of Time because someone interfered
 with Minbari religion and the results have caused her and her people to
 avoid doing so to others.  Valen is said to return.
 So 1,000 years ago, how did Valen do his coming and going?  I'm beginning
 to seriously wonder is this Valen guy was a Minbari at all.  Someone
 subduing a violent caste sounds like manipulation.  And those prophecies
 do hint at more knowledge than the Minbari had at that time.  Of course
 he could be a Minbari with powerful friends so he could maintain control
 and reign in the warrior caste AND set up the new Minbari government.  Or
 he could be powerful himself.  Perhaps he had the help of three
 triluminaries; I'm sure their powers, creatively applied, could go a long
 way.

to my astonishment, after I made my way through the complex web of studio
people, the person at the other end of the phone told me that apparently
there ARE no immediate plans to release the videos, because there is
concern that if they're available, it'll bring down ratings; also because
WB and the PTEN stations own the shows jointly, and some kind of complex
negotiations would have to take place to sell the show domestically.  I
pointed out that the cassettes are for sale in the UK, and doing very well,
and that if WB wasn't going to air the first season for a long time, then
why not release THAT one cassette for now?  No clear answer, but I've got
another name to speak with (upon his return from out of town), and we're
going to push for this from other directions.  I'm sure we'll get it done,

     Whether one becomes religious, warrior or worker caste is something
that arises early on, not through birth or genetics, but what you are
called to do, or feel called to do.  If you believe that you are calleed
to the religious life, you go to that part for a time, a few years, and
that is determined by you and to a certain extent, others.  If you seem
not suited toward that, they may work with you to find what you are more
suited for (and perhaps you felt *expected* to be called a certain way,
but that's not really where you're best suited).

     Writing for the page and writing for the stage are considerably
different processes; what looks good in a book sometimes sound bogus
coming out of someone's mouth.  Which is why it's so hard to translate
much of Bradbury's stuff to the screen; the language is lovely on the
page, but the second someone starts saying it, something goes wonky
and it sounds off.
 
     The only real key that I've ever had is to try and make yourself
stop writing and start listening; create the characters, make them as
real to yourself as you can, then get out of your own way and try to
listen to what they say and do, rather than trying to force them to behave
the way you think they should.

						                        jms


[Steven Orso's "Unified Field Theory of Conspiracies."  The Shadows and Vorlons
 are battling to control what their successors will be like; the Shadows want
 to cull out weakness, and are behind all the conspiracies, which can all be
 viewed as strong people edging out weak ones.  The mind control in comic
 issue #7 suggests that Takashima's participation in Sinclair's frameup in
 "The Gathering" might not have been a conscious choice; she served on Mars,
 where Garibaldi and Sinclair saw what they saw.]

     Along with John Miller's examination, this has to be one of the
most well-thought-out analyses yet.  I'd say that a lot of it holds
water.  (One nice side-element...I noted a while back that the comics
were not necessary to follow the series, as anything there would be at
some point mentioned in the show if it were important; here, you've
used it correctly to presage and four-wall the series and deduce some
very good stuff.)  Splendid work.

     Thanks.  That scene in "Coming of Shadows" is one of my favorites;
it does, as you say, convey that sense of wonder which is one of my main
goals with this show.
 
     Until "The Long Twilight Struggle," nothing else has come close to
that scene for me.  But there's some stuff in there that finally manages
to surpass it.  Just gorgeous and scary and awe-inspiring.

[Dates unknown, but sometime in June]

     Interestingly enough...yes, Warners does seem to take an interest in
where the series is going.  The one comment I hear most often is that they
enjoy seeing where the stories are going, and that they're not really like
the stories being done elsewhere.  This is the only one of the PTEN shows
to pick up even one Emmy, let alone the two we've received.  There were a
number of folks at WB who initially really weren't sure about us, who have
subsequently come around and have been very supportive.  Two of the main
folks who've taken an active interest and supported us are Dick
Robertson and Evan Thompson, between them the two Main Men of PTEN.
Without them, there wouldn't BE a Babylon 5 series.

      Yes, the Centauri/Narn war is a very handy distraction, which the
 shadows could use.  That's one of the two reasons they helped set the
 whole shebang going.
 
                                                                    jms

     I hope the reaction would be both; what a ride, and that's deep
(though I probably wouldn't use that exact wording).  It should also
create the sense that you've gone off and lived somewhere else, and
somewhen else, for five years.  When I got finished reading the Lensman
books, my sense wasn't really either of those expressed above, but a sense
that I had visited a real place, and lived through massive changes,
empires that rose and fell, and seen a genuine saga with massive
repercussions.  It should really have the sense of finishing a good book,
one which one would like to go back and reread again later.
 
     There are a number of philsophical undercurrents to the story, of
course, some of which are apparent now, some which will become clearer
later, and certainly a lot of action...but I'm shooting for something I
can't really define for you, except to say that it should somehow be more
than the sum of its parts.

[What kind of jazz do you like?]
     Jeez, I like a lot of it...Cout Basie, and Glen Miller, and Arty
Shaw (though some of his later stuff got a bit derivitive of the earlier
material), Tommy Dorsey, Gershwin...there's a CD came out a few years
ago, a reconstruction of a number of performances debuting new material
for the first time, and there's Gershwin playing (for lack of a better
term) the beta version of "Rhapsody in Blue," with *riffs he later
discarded*, and you can hear the differences, and understand why he made
them.  Cab Calloway...dynamite.

     Yes, the theory is to show the last 4 eps in October, and go right
into year three eps the next week in November, no break, so you'd get
about 8-9 eps in a row, rather than the usual 5 or so.

     Never said the shadow war would be over in one year.  Only that it
wouldn't last three.

     The long cuts exist only in the computer; there was never a fully

computer, the film is assembled only once, for the final product.  We'd
have to go in and re-edit EVERYthing to make it work.

Subject: JMS?? Re: RFD: rec.arts.sf.tv.

     I was asked if I wanted to be part of the discussion on this, and I
opted out, because I don't want to be in the position of unduly pressuring
anyone; I also barely understand the internet structure, and couldn't
add much of substance anyway.  Just end up muddying the waters further.
 
     Nor would my feelings on this be of much use, since they are totally
conflicted.  I like the free-ranging discussion that comes with an
unmoderated group.  On the other, there are more and more story ideas
being posted in the course of speculation.  One or two that I stumbled
across scared the hell out of me, though fortunately they ended up going
off in directions I had no intention of going in.
 
     I don't generally access internet through any other venue than this
one, provided by Ron Jarrell through my GEnie gateway, which minimizes my
contact with the net.
 
     My hope was that in not influencing the discussion, those minds which
understood the situation could come to some reasonable compromise
situation.  I do think that Jay has come down a tad harder than I would
have in similar circumstances, but that does not negate the core of the
concerns; I did not initiate this whole moderation debate, but it was bound
to become an issue sooner or later.
 
     What I've told Ron, and Jay, and others, is that I want a solution that
affects/impinges on others as little as possible.  This is, fundamentally,
MY problem, and I've always felt uncomfortable making others compensate
for my problem.  So I simply, honestly don't know what to do.  (I know that
Ron has some ideas he's going to call about next week, so maybe he'll have
a solution.)
 
     There are times I do think it'd be better and simpler for me just to
withdraw from internet, since after all I can still be reached easily via
email, and my address is on the nets, so folks wouldn't have a hard time
reaching me.  But I don't know if that's right either.
 
     All of which should give you some idea of why I'm not doing much in
this discussion; I can pretty convincingly argue just about every point of
view.

with what has apparently been a flood of messages, phone calls, letters
and skywriting incidents.  (Well, okay, I made up the last one.)  From the
proverbial horse's mouth...we have now delivered to Warner Bros. two of
the remaining four episodes.  The first was delivered three weeks ago,
the second about a week ago.  The third should be in their hands this
week, the last a bit thereafter.  I have no clear understanding what the
airing arrangements might be between C4 and Warners, but any support that
we can provide is there for the asking.
 
     We sometimes allow ourselves the conceit that Babylon 5 has a very
British feel to it, as much of the better SF has come from the UK, and
its tone is not far from what we do.  We are thus inestimably pleased by
the great support C4 has shown for the series, the friendliness, courtesy
and patience of its staffers, and we look forward to a long and
productive relationship.

     Ted: I think your note is even-handed and well considered.  For me,
any one of the items you discuss being present isn't a big deal; it's the
cumulative effect of all of them being present in both shows, at the same
time, airing within weeks of one another.
 
     The result of all this nearly killed B5 in its early stages, which
I think was the desired effect.  You must understand that when B5 was
announced in the trades for the first time in November of that year (2-3
months prior to the announcement of DS9), in articles that described it
pretty succinctly (space station, rogues, renegades, all the usual H'wood
hype), it was often referred to as Warner's attempt to create a space
franchise (see above re: hype).
 
     There has *long* been bad blood between Paramount and Warner Bros.
Particularly since Paramount was then already setting the blocks in place
to create its own network, and PTEN was being birthed right then, setting
the stage for major conflict.  The number of syndicated stations is very
small, and the hours available per station equally small.  Faced with
that kind of scenario, big guns tend to be pulled out.
 
     Whatever the sequence of events might have been, the result was that
I ended up sitting in meetings with Warner execs who said, "How am I
supposed to sell this show?  It's *identical* to DS9 in any way that
matters, the syndicated market can't sustain two identical shows like
this, and they've go the Star Trek name to entice station owners.  Nobody
knows from 'Babylon 5.'"
 
     Understand, since the debuts, the shows have gone off in different
directions, but we're talking the first season and the pilot.  Nearly all
the articles described them as nearly identical at that stage.  And the
details of character don't often play to TV execs who only see the broad
strokes, the "quick concept."
 
     The fact that the two shows were so similar at that time, one a nobody
show from nowhere, the other bundled with the STAR TREK (tm) name, came
within an inch of killing Babylon 5.  (Which wasn't helped by A Certain
Studio telling advertisers that B5 was going to be crap, cheaply produced,
and not to bother.)  That's one of the main reasons why it took nearly a
period of four months before we finally got the go order for year one,
after everybody crunched the ratings, and the demos, and decided to take
a chance on it.  And even THEN we were told, "The syndie market can't
sustain two shows like this; you're gonna get creamed."
 
     Through the clipping service, I saw one newspaper/magazine article
after another calling B5 a "clone" of DS9.  Because they considered them
identical.  Many ST fans felt the same way, and said so, openly.  "Jeez,
they copied EVERYthing," one noted.  Now, when we point out which really
came first, suddenly some of these same folks say, "Nah...they're not
alike at ALL.  Don't be silly."
 
     One could get whiplash from such a thing.
 
     To step back a second, the reality is that this sort of thing happens
in hollywood all the time.  When "The Abyss" was being produced, several
other films with identical concepts were rushed forward (remember Deepstar
7 or 9 or whatever that was?).  Consequently, one of the things you most
protect are the details of your project.  You don't want a possible
competitor to know what you're doing.  Unfortunately, right there in the
files at Paramount was every last detail about how we were going to do B5,
the station, the stories, everything.
 
     Now, I'm sure that the Paramount execs said, "No, no...we won't look
at it, we won't open the drawer, we'll remain pure and virginal and even
though we're trying to beat Warners in creating a new network, even though
they're threatening to break our monopoly on space/future shows, we won't
open that file drawer, no sir."
 
     They could not possibly have said, "Okay, open the file drawer.
Let's take a peek at what they're going to do.  We won't copy it, exactly,
but knowing what they're doing will allow us to co-opt a little of their
franchise, enough to cut them off at the knees in the marketplace.  We
won't tell Berman or Pillar about this, because they would never go along
with it, but we'll just *guide* them here and there.  We give notes all
the time in development, who's to know where they came from?"
 
     And just to be clear, so the sarcasm doesn't get in the way: I have
never, *ever* felt, or believed, or thought, that Berman or Pillar EVER
saw or knew about the B5 information.  Had anyone suggested anything of a
less than straightforward nature, they would have refused; of that I have
no doubt.  No sarcasm, that's what I think.

     RE: the bone crests on the Minbari, the notion expressed by David
Sueme detailing evolutionary notions omits the most rudimentary fact
about such things when he says it's illogical from a birth perspective:
They're not BORN that way, any more than elks are born with full-length
horns.  Like any other species that grows bony-matter outside the head
(deer, cows, bulls, certified public accountants), it's either not there
at birth or nascent.  It gradually grows out.  Ditto for the Minbari.
There are elaborate rituals of shaping and honing and cutting as one's
crest grows.  Some crests are shaped more in tune with the military caste
than the religious caste, for instance.
 
     It grows out to create a protective sheath around the back of the
head, where the internal skull can sometimes be fragile, to provide
added reinforcement.

Subject: From JMS: What Exec Prods Do

     Every couple of days, as today, I get one or another message saying,
"In this episode, did you have anything to do with, or were you involved
with...." and it's the script, or an actor, or whatever.  All legitimate
questions.  In thinking about this, it occured to me that maybe it might
be a good idea to go over what an executive producer actually *does*.
 
     So file this under "How I Spend My Days," by J. Michael Straczynski,
Age 12
 
     1) I write scripts.  12 the first year, 15 the second.  When you see
my name on a script, every action and dialogue was written that way.  My
scripts are very detailed.  There is very, *very* little improv allowed
on the show, not necessarily because I think each word is golden but
because a changed word can mess up an important sentence that foreshadows
something 4-6 episodes down the road.  If an actor is having a problem
with a line, which happens occasionally but rarely, and wants to substitute
one word with another, somebody comes from the stage to my office, 15 feet
away, and checks to make sure it's okay.
 
     2) I work with the prosthetics/makeup people in conceptualizing
and approving makeups.  I partly sculpted the original version of Delenn's
headpiece in the pilot.  Prosthetics folks read the script, come up with
several designs, run them past me, and I approve one or the other.
 
     3) I work with the costume designers, again with final approval on
all elements.  Sometimes if I have something specific in mind, I'll try
and sketch it out.  (I can't draw for squat, and our costume designer finds
my pathetic scribblings very amusing, and...."cute."  I once drew a kitty
on the same page as a costume note, just to show her i was improving my
range.  She stuck it on her wall.  Argh.)  Usually she comes up with
designs, runs them past me, I make some notes or suggestions of varying
coherence, and she runs with it.
 
     4) I approve all set designs, and again, once in a while, will get
into the act with a rough sketch of one sort or another.  Any artwork,
posters, signage, set dressing, props...all go through my office for
personal approval.
 
     5) Along with the director and a few others, I sit in on all casting
and have final right of decision, along with Doug, and we rarely
disagree.
 
     6) I approve all directors and writers for the show, and work with
both.  In the case of directors, we speak about the episode many times,
and have "tone meetings" just before shooting in which we go over every
page to discuss the visualization and make sure we're on the same track.
I try to slip out onto the set when possible to make sure we're still on
the right track.  If I see something that may not be what I had in mind,
I'll either defer if it works, or if I'm concerned, I'll pull the
director aside for a quiet discussion, and let the director relay my
notes to the actors.  (On the set, there can only be one voice, and that
is the director, in terms of relaying instructions to crew and cast.)
 
     7) I work with the composer, determining in- and out-cues for music,
and where I have something in mind, expressing it to Christopher.
 
     8) Working with the CGI folks on exactly what given sequences should
look like, and how long they should be.
 
     9) After the director makes his/her cut, John Copeland and I go in to
make the producer's cut.  We sometimes re-edit every frame, or do a light
dusting.  Generally I work more with the character stuff, and he's good at
action stuff (hence my nickname for John, Captain Action).  We sometimes
spend as much as two days going over every single frame, to tighten and
make it stronger.
 
     When you have a crew and cast as talented as we do, a lot of the
preceding stages amount to basically saying "yup" a lot, and in all of
this, John Copeland is my good right arm; I rely on his judgment
implicitly.
 
     (John is also our resident military expert, and he does a lot to
keep us in line with tradition.  I think when the B5 history is eventually
written, his importance to the show will really come through.)
 
                                                                    jms

     Excuse me, Michelle, but I resent your message.  I have absolutely
NO control whatsoever to the airing schedule of Babylon 5; I can help
set up which episodes within a given period will air, in what order, but
when PTEN decides that NO episodes are going to air in that period, there
ain't squat I can do about it, and believe me, I tried; I can't count the
numbers of phone calls I made, to no effect.  To take a situation over
which I have no control, which I didn't know when I was writing or
producing the episodes, about which I am *very* upset, and try to make
me responsible for that, and therefore that I am a hypocrite for holding
back the great war, is just about as low as one can get.
 
     Further, you're operating out of what you think the war is.  It's one
large war that spirals into another.  The Narns and the Centauri are at
war.  You can't just dismiss it as the trigger; thousands of Narns and
many Centauri are *dying*.  And the last four episodes are planned to
escalate the hell out of this.
 
     I'm sorry if it's not sufficiently nasty at this point to satisfy
your bloodthirstiness.

     Unfortunately, Bob, you are one of those people of whom Harlan
speaks when he says you have no sense of the real history of the story
behind ST.  He did more than just write "City"...he brought in ohter
SF writers, rewrote them on the QT in some cases, fronted ST to SFWA and
vice versa; he was the one who fronted a mass mailing to leading SF pros
and other urging them to do all they could to keep the show on the air
when it looked like it was going to be canceled at the end of its second
season.
 
     He did more beyond that, but that's a start.  So on that count, you
are absolutely wrong and ignorant of the facts.
 
     Item #2, he has never "cheated or swindled" the authors involved with
"The Last Dangerous Visions."  Each author was paid, with a fee that
covers X-amount of time.  At the end of X-amount of time, he sends another
check to renew his right to publish those stories.  Any author who wants
to pull his story, can do so, and some have.  Most haven't, and are
content to wait.
 
     The paralogia you exhibit in your message is blatant and sad.  You
try to attack his statements on ST with false and uninformed opinion, then
drag in TLDV as if to somehow verify his lack of character in speaking his
mind about Star Trek.  Using anything, however false or irrelevant, to
discredit the messenger who's saying stuff you don't want to hear.
 
     Tough.

     The problem with the competition discussion is that it doesn't address
the issues from an industry standpoint.  It's not an issue of "Well, DS9
isn't sweating because they're getting better ratings than B5."  It's not
per se a competition on that level.  What worries Paramount is ANY other
show like B5 even existing, because it dilutes their monopoly on this
kind of space show, which has existed for 30 years.  Also, over time, DS9's
ratings have gotten very soft; a number of their folks have drifted over
to B5.  Given their huge expensive budget, even while they may stay way
ahead of us in the ratings, if they drop below a certain point it's going
to cause them problems.

     Please cite for me, Rob, those stories you've heard about literary

total fiction of grossly exaggerated by those who want to do harm.
 
     As for not delivering a book manuscript for X-years...this is not a
big deal, frankly, and it's not the business of anyone not directly
involved.  Hell, I've been trying for the last six years to finish the
revisions to the scriptwriting book; I've said I was just about finished,
only to get hammered by something and time slips.  It happens to every
writer.
 
     And the same people who say, "Why hasn't he finished his work?" are
the ones who chivvy and harrass him, send him abusive mail, subscribe him
to magazines he doesn't want, start organizations like Enemies of
Ellison, and do everything they can to wind him up to the point where
nobody could get ANY work done.  That he's delivered as much as he has,
equal to or more than my output on any year, is amazing, given that this
is ALSO the man with Epstein/Barr (Chronic Fatigue Syndrome) and has had
two heart attacks and two surgical heart procedures.
 
     Gee, I wonder why he's distracted.
 
     Priest and the rest of his ilk should get a fucking life and maybe do

program.  Further, I've seen just as many people here hitting critical
mass about the PTEN delay as those discussing Paramount/ST, probably more.
 
     "Does this mean that people like Franklin who criticize Trek writers

being hypocritical?  Absolutely."
 
     Ted...what the fuck are you talking about?  I'd like to know because
this doesn't parse on any level; it doesn't touch reality at any two
contiguous points.  A writer is responsible for only one thing: what goes
into the script.  You might as well blame the writer for some station
airing the show at 11 p.m. vs. 8 p.m.  Which is sheer madness on your
part.
 
     There is creative meddling with the program's contents, and scheduling
meddling which all happens after the contents are completed.  These are
as different as night and day.  A writer is responsible for the contents
of his/her scripts; and is NOT responsible in any way, manner, shape or
form for the scheduling of that episode.  I'm sorry, Ted, but this is one
of your more extraordinarily dumb postings, and there've been some
real whoppers, lemme tell you.

Subject: From jms: Harlan Merchandise

     Most of you may not be aware of the existence of the Harlan Ellison
Record Collection.  Harlan Ellison, besides being Conceptual Consultant
for Babylon 5, and a leading writer, is also an amazing performer on
stage, and when reading his own material.  One of his recordings was
recently nominated for a Grammy Award.
 
     All prior releases from HERC have been on LP (and they are all
terrific, recordings of "I'm Looking for Kadak" and "Jefty is Five" and
a collection of his appearances such as "On the Road with Harlan
Ellison").  Well, now his first CD is out, his reading of the award
winning story "Paladin of the Lost Hour," which was also done as an
episode of The Twilight Zone, guest-starring Danny Kaye.
 
     If you've never heard Harlan read, you've got to check this one
out.  He doesn't so much read as *perform* the story, playing all the
parts, with inflections and accents and a wonderful dramatic flair.  As
with all the rest, it's a joy to listen to.
 
     This brand-new, first-time ever release of "Paladin" is 55 minutes
in length, and the price is $16.50 plus $2 for postage and handling.
Again, this is the CD.  There are discounts for those who join HERC
which for a yearly membership fee of $8 gets you the HERC Newsletter,
with bits from Harlan, edited by his wife Susan Ellison, and access to
all of his previously published books *and* prior HERC recordings.
(For HERC members, btw, the "Paladin" CD goes for $15 with $2 postage
and handling.)
 
     The address, for those interested, is: The Harlan Ellison Record
Collection, P. O. Box 55548, Sherman Oaks, CA 91413.  (Checks or money
orders only, no plastic.)
 
     I've been meaning to pass this info along for a while now, but the
release of "Paladin of the Lost Hour" gives me a good opportunity to do
so finally.  For those who like audio books, radio drama (some of the
recordings incorporate some elements of production, and sound effects,
though minimally), performance art, storytelling...this is definitely
something you'll want to consider.
 
     (If anyone wants to add this info to any of the WWW pages out there
for future use in the archives, that'd be a Nifty Thing.)

Subject: ATTN, JMS: Jumpgate question

     You might as well ask who invented the computer.  The principles have
always been there, written in the universe for people to decode, as we
have been doing throughout centuries.  At various points, races stumble
upon items like jumpgate technology the same way they stumble upon fire,
or radium, or the piston engine.

Subject: ATTN JMS: No Na'Toth? But you

     No, I never said that the character of Na'Toth was needed to relay
information to another character.  (It would be infinitely better if the
tens of thousand of people you cite who memorize every comment checked
the actual statement, 'cause often it's misphrased from memory, and then
I get held accountable for it.)  I said that she had to have certain
information, period.  Specifically, when G'Kar came back, I needed
someone there who he could talk to about the shadows, and get us into
that part.  Someone who knew he'd been gone, and why.  Otherwise, he'd
be spilling his guts to a total stranger, and he wouldn't *do* that.
Hence, you need Na'Toth.

     J. Potts...your report reflects exactly what I'd been afraid of,
that the event was going to be an organizational disaster.  The cast were
game to go for the fans, and I'm glad to see that they did okay in that
regard, but they can't do much about how the con is organized.  This all
pretty much confirms that my concerns were justified.

Subject: ATTN JMS: Ideas to help newbie

     We broached the idea of a one-hour "Mysteries of
Babylon 5" special to PTEN; unfortunately, it seems problematic.  Fox can
set aside a block of time because it's a true network; PTEN would have
to go to each station individually and sell the one-hour show, and that
is apparently very difficult.

     Hardin: the key issue, always, is the introduction of new plot
elements and actions not previously introduced.  It's the difference
between saying what something may *mean*, and suggesting something that
may *happen*.  The more precise the suggestion, the more problematic it
becomes.

Subject: JMS: Plausable deniability?

     I have made considerable mention that I don't access the internet
any other way.  Proving access is key to any legal problems.  If I'm here
posting regularly, that de facto proves access.  If I'm not, it becomes
more difficult to prove.
 
     Second, the material *is* all put away, and dated, but the key isn't
just winning the case, which would happen; I just would rather not spend
the next 2 years of my life subsequent to a problem in depositions, and
hearings, and more hearings, and closeted with lawyers in the course of
defending myself against somebody.

Subject: ATTN JMS: Writing Software Que

     I used to use Wordstar, with macros to adjust dialogue margins,
almost constantly in writing scripts.  Then the last two places I worked,
including Universal and "Murder, She Wrote" went over to Movie Master,
which is basically a no-brainer script program that has all the margins
and formatting set up.  After learning that one, it kinda stuck, and
that's the one I use now for B5.

Subject: First Blood

     There does seem to be some symbolism in that, though I think it came
more subconsciously than consciously; the Narns and Centauri classify the
other as the deadly enemy, but the visible fights and woundings have come
from their own kind.  We are always our own worst enemies.
 
     Though that will change, shortly.
