     Here's a great example of how critics don't have a clue about the
genre or its roots, or what springs from what.  There's a review in
today's Daily Variety (Tuesday) of John Carpenter's new film "In the Mouth
of Madness," which on every level is an H. P. Lovecraft pastiche, from
the structure, the characters, the locales, the names, everything.  So
what does the reviewer call it 3-4 times?  A tribute to Stephen King.

     No, Garibaldi's authority doesn't exceed Sheridan's.  But when
Sheridan's superiors give Garibaldi a direct order to have the quarters
locked out, that they are illegally occupied...Garibaldi must comply.
That is standard legal military procedure.  (Funnily enough, I've gotten
a couple of notes from folks in the military -- one Navy, and one
Marine -- citing similar petty stuff happening to their COs.)
 
     At five miles long, with hundreds of miles of piping, leaks are
going to happen.  Some are more serious than others.  At that moment,
Sheridan was concerned about psis, not leaks.  He's trying to be
inconspicuous; he wouldn't stop in the midst of all this and order a
repair team.  He'd probably do it later.  ("Come alone," he was told.
So now a maintainance team shows up....)

     I don't think I ever can quite view an episode as complete; I always
can think of one thing or another that could've been done.  And sometimes
even the broadcast version isn't the end.  In occasional episodes there
have been small, but noticeable (to me, anyway) CGI glitches which, even
though we've seen the footage a zillion times, we don't see until the day
it airs.  And when possible I ask that the scene be re-rendered, dropped
into the master, and re-satellited.  We've altered the main title about
five times since episode one, just trying to make it look or sound
better.
 
     When eventually we do the transfers to tape and laserdisk, I'll
probably go in there and futz around some more...little things that very
likely nobody will ever notice, but to me they're important.

Date: 5 Feb 1995 04:55:30 -0500

     The hard part is getting fans of ST to step back and look objectively
at the show, and realize that AS fans of ST, they should allow it its
chance.  ST began as one person's original vision, which is now in its
third distillation of that original vision.  B5 is an original vision, the
first since ST to try something on this scale.
 
     And there are many parallels between the histories of the two shows.
 
     B5 and ST both had to overcome vehement fans and critics who much
preferred a prior SF show (ST and Lost in Space, respectively).
 
     B5 and ST both worked for a long time to get on the air, and both
ended up in making casting changes in the commanding officer and the
first officer.  (Kirk followed Pike, and Spock followed Number One, as
Sheridan followed Sinclair, and Ivanova followed Takashima.)
 
     B5 and ST were primarily the product of one person's vision and
creative control.
 
     B5 and ST both extrapolated the future of Earth and space travel using
the best contemporary science, both created whole species and set up
vast interplanetary politics and languages.
 
     I just have this hunch that a number of "screw-B5" ST fans are going
to end up in a few years like the "screw-Star Trek" Lost in Space fans
who thought ST was crap trying to steal LiS's audience and place in the
TV landscape.

     Your feelings about the war starting are exactly what they should be,
and what I wanted to achieve with "Shadows."  In SF TV, very often, as
you state, it's "Yeah, let's get a war on!  Blow stuff up!"  But to hear
of a *real* war...it's very, very sobering.  When we hear that Gulf troops
were being sent into the Mideast, when we heard of soviet troops sent into
Prague...your heart stops for a moment.  When Kennedy put American ships in
a Cuban blockade and the world held its breath...THAT is what it feels like
to step into possible or real war.  All you can think of is, "How the HELL
did we get into this, and how the hell do we get OUT of it?"  And that was
at the emotional core of "Shadows."

     Yeah, on several levels, writing "The Coming of Shadows" was hard;
there were times I felt as though I'd just jumped onto the back of a
runaway dynamite truck.  Halfway through that story you can feel the arc
kinda moving underneath you, like some huge, dark fish about to break
surface.
 
     The only way to make a viewer feel a character's pain is if you feel
it in the writing, and a lot of that came through.  I live with these
characters running around in my head 24 hours a day...and when I'd finally
finished "Shadows," it was as if they all sorta stopped and looked at
each other, and at me, and said, "Gee, thank you EVER so fucking much,
jeezus, why don't you just go pluck somebody's eye out while you're at it?"
 
     To which the only reply is, "Now that you mention it...."

Subject: Re: Thank You
Date: 8 Feb 1995 05:08:31 -0500

     Just an observation on the serial discussion...you're talking apples
and oranges.  You can't compare a film serial from the 30s or 40s with
TV; they're not the same thing.  Yes, serial stories were done then; but
in American TV, they haven't been done in this fashion (I'm exempting
soap operas which sorta redefine themselves moment by moment).
 
     As an aside...serials in the early days of movies didn't start out
for the purpose of telling one story as its expressed goal.  (And, in
fact, if you watch some of them straight through, what you find is a VERY
simple story/structure, along the lines of "Stop them from stealing the
very famous Star of Rhodesia Diamond" which is broken up into barely
connected individual pieces.  Very often, the studio would have a vague
idea about where it would end, and just filled in the middle with car
crashes and fist fights and dynamite explosions.
 
     The reason for that continuing structure lay with 1) the fact that
at that time, and in the years before, most of the magazines of the time
serialized books a chapter at a time, a technique that goes straight back
to Charles Dickens.  So that was the template at the time.  And 2) most
or all movies in those early days consisted of one-reelers, or at most
two-reelers, since it was felt then that audiences probably wouldn't sit
still for two hours for a movie.
 
     Consequently, you'd go down to the local Rialto, and you'd get a
traveling tab show...local live performers, a singer, some piano, a short
animated cartoon, a Chaplin or Laurel and Hardy one-reeler, then work
your way up to maybe a half-hour movie, or a two-reeler.  Gradually, as
movies got longer, the serials also got longer, in many cases ending up
as full-length features themselves.  Or they were phased out.
 
     So it wasn't that the studios were looking to tell a story over five
years; it was that they felt the market couldn't sustain more than bite
sized stories.
 
     Proving again that a little knowledge of history is a dangerous
thing....

Subject: B5's Story Arc = No Free Will
Date: 8 Feb 1995 05:10:21 -0500

     One problem, of course, is that your message about predestination
being a drag is that you think you know where it's going.  When we first
went on the air, I saw many messages from people saying "Boy, this is
gonna get real boring, everybody's part is already laid out in order for
this to be a five-year story, Londo's the funny guy, G'Kar's the bad
guy, they're locked into their roles...."
 
     Well, now...I think we see the flaw in that particular approach.
 
     On the notion that "plots are less than organic," plots are by
definition not organic.  Plots are artificialities which we graft onto
a sequence of events in order to give them meaning.  As someone noted,
"The king died, and the queen died" is not a plot or a story; "The king
died, and the queen died of grief" IS a story, IS a plot; there is
connective tissue.
 
     There is always a guiding hand behind the story, otherwise you'd
just have the characters sitting around and having random things happen
to them.
 
     And not all foreshadowing is real foreshadowing; some is planted as
red herrings.  Some foreshadows don't mean what you THINK they mean.  I
have planted no end of turns, twists, surprises, reverses, double
reveals, backtracks, ironies and revelations all along the path.
 
     I have always considered the Babylon 5 story to be, in essence,
future history.  "Babylon 5 WAS the last of the Babylon stations.  It WAS
our last, best hope for peace."  Past tense.  If I write a novel about
the incidents of World War II, then I'm dealing in history.  The events
are set...but where the characters go is another question.  You can read
all the information about how we got a thousand clues and foreshadows to
what was going to happen at Pearl Harbor...but it happened anyway.  The
guiding hand of Fate...or a crucial bobble at the wrong moment?  One can
look back at it now and argue both sides.
 
     Finally, any time a writer writes a novel, the characters are all
going somewhere under the guiding hand of the author.  That's what a
novel IS.  Scrooge is GOING to be visited by three ghosts, and he's GOING
to reform, and that's the end of the discussion.  Unless you're willing to
throw long-form novel writing out the door as an artform because it's not
appropriate that the characters should be on a specific and crafted
journey....

     Not a contradiction.  I don't believe in omniscient or all powerful

the time.  It was stated *plainly and clearly* that the device was used
in healing terminally ill patients.  They cannot undo physical damage from
gunshots (the regen packs and other devices were used to heal Garibaldi's
wound, and the alien device was used to raise his life energy level enough
to bring him out of the coma).  The emperor suffered a massive attack that
destroyed parts of his heart.  Can't be fixed by this device.

Date: 8 Feb 1995 18:06:55 -0500

     Re: "fixing" the "guy with the bozo hair," I don't see this as
something that needs to be fixed.  The problem is with some people's
provincialism and rapidity with stereotyping and the like.  It's also
in large measure an American fixation with hair; the show is playing in
MANY european markets, and this tends not to be a problem there.  I find
it interesting that some people can accept red eyes, reptilian features,
pouches, six-set genitalia, jump gates, headbones, shadowships, but fall
apart because of somebody's hair.  Americans are fixated on this stuff;
an entire generation was pegged, stereotyped and ridiculed because of
their hair; you can go down to parts of LA and see hair styles that make
Londo look like a protestant minister by comparison.
 
     There is a notion that one must "fix" something if a few people have
a problem that stems from their perception.  This is what leads to lowest
common denominator programming.  I don't do that.

is literary, or refers to a literary influence; it should have a certain
rhythm, and avoid coming at the subject of the episode too dead-on.  For
instance, one could call the recent Psi Cop episode with Bester,
"Capture" or "Chase."  But I wanted it to be evocative, to conjure up
the image of people slipping through the shadows, pursued by others, and
to continue this season's trend toward titles that indicate a coming
night.  Hence, "A Race Through Dark Places."

hour script, for another series, what happens to that character has
been determined by the writer.  THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS FREE WILL IN
A FICTIONAL CHARACTER'S LIFE.
 
     As for working within the B5 universe itself, as Ladira said, her
visions are of things that MIGHT be.  The whole POINT is that people
make choices in this show.  Yes, they're the choices the writer provides
them...but what other choice is there?  If you can materialize Ivanova in
a real Babylon 5 and let her do as she chooses, I'm all for it.  Until
then, somebody has to make up the story, and the universe, and the
situations.

to take any given person on this show.  And you're almost certainly
wrong at one level or another.
 
     This kind of reminds me of conversations I find at conventions, when
I appear with the actors.  The actors get questions like, "How do you go
about creating the character?" and I get, "What will the stories be?" as
though I was walking down the street one day, stumbled across these
independently-existing characters, and shoved them into this storyline.
You cannot, in any conceivable fashion, minimize the contribution of the
cast, which is superlative.  But I created Ivanova, and Sheridan, and
Sinclair, and Garibaldi, and Kosh, and Londo, and G'Kar, and the Earth
Alliance, and the Vorlons, and the Psi Corps, and I write the words they
say, the rooms they're in, the changes in their lives.  Just like every
novelist you've ever seen.
 
     There's no such thing as a character having free will within the
structure of a story.  Certainly they can seem to come alive in the
writing process, but that's not the same thing.

     Correct, the Earth Alliance is not necessarily a just system.  Quite
correct.  Thus I'm not sure where I see the problem.  Has humanity ever
had a 100% just and equitable system?

     Turhan originally came in to audition for Elric in "Geometry;" we
wanted someone with more menace (Ansara), but we were all just blown away
by how wonderful and sweet and nice a person he was, and as he left, I
told John Copeland, "I'm gonna write a part just for him."
 
     So I did, and we cast him, and everyone on the set loved him...to
the point that, at the end of the shoot, they were saying, "You BASTARD,
how could you bring this WONDERFUL man in here and then KILL HIM OFF SO
WE CAN'T HAVE HIM BACK?!"

     General and sundry to whoever might be interested....
 
     1) Next Thursday evening (the 16th), I'll be at Planet Hollywood in
Chicago along with Claudia Christian, Mira Furlan, and Michael O'Hare
to do a PR appearance in part for the show, in part for the convention
there in June, and for some various non-story-related announcements.  The
plan is to watch the episode there that night, do Q&A and generally hang
out.  Though this is usually a closed deal for publicity (ET and CNN and
other media will be there), a limited number (I think 150) tickets have
been allocated for fans of the show in the area, I think $30 apiece.
Contact the same folks running the Chicago Big Bang Convention ahead of
time to order tickets; these will probably sell out quickly.
 
     2) Chris Franke has finalized the revised CD soundtrack; the new
suite, entitled "The Geometry of Shadows," adds about 12-14 minutes to
the CD, which now weighs in at about 55-56 minutes.  The new suite
includes the second season main theme, selections from "Chrysalis" and
"Survivors" and "Signs and Portents" and "The Coming of Shadows," as
well as an extended version of "Requiem For the Line."  The first 2,000
copies have already been booked and will be sent to fill orders hanging
fire from the UK, with broader distribution starting in March.  This is
from Sonic Images, which because it isn't *as* large a company as Warner
Records or others, but is still good sized, will be fighting to meet all
the orders that have come in and are coming in.
 
     Thus, I suggest that if you want to a) get the soundtrack, and b)
not wait for back orders, you contact your local record store or discount
distributer service and order the CD right off, which will help assure
getting them as they come off the line, and help Sonic Images best plan
their run.  The CD also comes with an expanded booklet, with more
pictures from the show (including a 3-shot of me with fellow producers
Doug Netter and John Copeland...but hey, buy it anyway).  It's a wonder
to behold.
 
     3) At this point, I've confirmed that I'll be in the UK twice this
year, once at the Horizons Convention in Birmingham come April, and then
in September at the Wolf 359/Gathering convention in Manchester.

Subject: ATTN JMS: Your lucid dream...
Date: 12 Feb 1995 04:14:41 -0500

     Not that much going on, I'm afraid to say.  Upper floor renovations
are about finished, and now they're doing some foundation work.  A couple
of new stores opened downtown.  Spent a couple of dreamtime nights over at
the local college, doing Q&As about writing.  Went past an accident on the
main road the other night, car half-in and half-out of the water.  Folks
seemed okay.
 
     That's about it.
 
     (For those looking on, to explain...I know this is weird...but for as
long as I can remember, most of my dreams have taken place in the same
sort of dream town that's gradually built slowly over the years.  I have
a house there, know where the stores are, the theaters...it has no
correlation to anything real, it's all contemporaneous with the present,
and generally just a flip-side.  Fairly dull, actually.  I think the
reason my brain generated this was that we moved from house to house and
town to town every six months to a year when I was growing up, and this
is/was my brain's attempt to form solidity by *creating* a home town from
bits and pieces of the others.  So at night, I leave *here* and go
_there_.)
 
     Oh!  Wait, we *did* have a bus strike recently, so that's at least
something interesting.  Haven't heard how it turned out, though.

     The story arc proceeds very much as planned; the change of COs allows

In addition, there are trap doors for every character in case there's ever
a problem.  As in a WW II movie, characters may come and go, but the story
of the war is the story of the war.

(things) that we do?  What are the hairline fractures in our personalities
that cause one person to become a Mother Theresa and another to become a
serial killer?  What are the choices between here and there?  Basically,
the fundamental questions of who are we, what are we doing here, why are
we doing what we're doing, where are we going, and what shall we do when
we get there?

Subject: JMS:Do you enjoy talking to us
Date: 15 Feb 1995 00:51:24 -0500

     I don't know enough about how these informal RPG groups function, so
really can't comment.
 
     Do I enjoy it?  For the most part, yes.  The other frustrations are
pretty much the same ones faced by anyone else on the net; the occasional
offhand insults or dismissals, the trolls and flames, the person who says
"If this had been a ST episode, I would've given it a 10, but since I
expect more from B5 I'm only giving it a 2"  rather than judging it simply
on its own merits, the person who feels he has to find SOMETHING negative
to say or he feels he's not participating properly....
 
     I've been riding the nets for over 10 years.  So after a while, you
come to know what to expect.  And the majority of it is nothing less than
swell.  Whether the analysis is positive or negative, often it comes with
thought and consideration and cogent, perceptive commentaries, and one
can't help but learn and be impressed.
 
     Most of the other folks I know who work in SF TV think I'm insane to
be here, to this extent, every single day.  Because there's often a kind
of love/hate relationship between SF TV people and viewers.
 
     Here's an example (and please, this is NOT a case of "the author
speaking through an imaginary third person").  This is a writer/producer
who's worked on a number of SF series (or in one case, a contemporary
fantasy series), who no longer works in the genre, instead seeing out work
in non-SF/fantasy venues.  I ran into him at a local newsstand here in
Sherman Oaks a while back, and I asked him about his decision.  This,
though a paraphrase from memory, is what he said:
 
     "The viewers drove me out of it.  I just got tired of it.  While
some of them are okay, the majority of them are just damned ungrateful.
You bust your ass making a show, 12-16 hours a day.  You put it out there,
and all they ever want to do is nitpick.  They crab, they bitch, they
moan, they pick things apart until there's nothing left.  Then when you're
finally canceled, they scream at you asking why you're not on the air.
Well, if you'd *supported* the show when it was on the air instead of
bitching about it all the time, maybe it *would* be on the air.  In two
years on [insert name of a high-visibilty police-type series] I haven't
had any of that.  Same with the other non-SF shows I've done.  They turn
on the show, and either they like it, or they don't like it, they don't
tear it to shreds in front of your eyes, call you names, insult you or
bitch at you.  [Name and Name] feel the same way about it that I do, and
they're looking to get off [series name] for the same reason.  They're
just going crazy with it.  It's got nothing to do with not wanting to
hear negative opinions, just the way they do it."
 
     Now, obviously, I have some very real disagreements with some of the
sentiments expressed here.  Part of it, I think, is that I do come out of
the world of being a fan, and I think I better understand the situation,
that it comes out of being invovled with a show and the ideas behind it
in a very visceral fashion.  Also, I think that if you're not on the nets
or out among the fans regularly, all you'll here ARE the negative things,
because those are the ones who tend to write...those who're pissed off.
People who like a show don't often write in to say so.  But on the nets,
or at conventions, you're more apt to encounter them.  Absent that, it's
easy to see how someone might come away with the notion that it's all
just negative.
 
     Are there, from time to time, unfair or ill-considered criticisms of
this or any other show?  Of course there are.  That goes with the
territory.  Are they disproportionately outweighed by the thoughtful and
insightful criticisms?  Definitely.  As for how you're treated...I feel
that if you treat fans with respect, they will treat you with respect, and
as a consequence, while there have been some occasional hiccups here and
there, I'd have to say that yes, I do enjoy the exchange, it is both
entertaining and rewarding, and I'm happy to continue it.
 
     Even if some of my associates *do* think I'm nuts.
 
                                                                  jms

Date: 18 Feb 1995 06:01:56 -0500

     Another comparison somebody made about B5 recently was to Bradbury's
Martian Chronicles books; independent, but they add up at the end.
 
     To follow up on your (Dianne's) other point...yes, from time to time,
as we push ourselves to the limit, we're going to crash and burn.  That's
part of the risk if you really want to try and do something different.  We
push the envelope...and sometimes get a papercut.  I had, for instance,
MUCH more in mind for the EFX in the final confrontation in "The Long
Dark."  But we were, alas, about this > < much ahead of the technology to
pull off what I wanted.
 
     The pattern is, write an episode that goes a little further than the
last time.  See if you can do it.  Find which aspects of that worked, and
push it *again*.  If we can do a stationary base and mine field with one
batch of ships in "Midnight," can we do a larger base and *two* competing
groups of ships (three if you count the shadows and centauri) in "Coming
of Shadows")?
 
     As Paul Bryant says at Foundation, we try to ride the bleeding edge
of storytelling and technology.  Or to quote an old SAS pin I own, "Who
Dares, Wins."

     It has never been stated that other worlds or species or
civilizations don't have the technology to use gravity, magnetic or other
forces to move objects.  It was used in "Sky Full of Stars" when the
Minbari cruiser pulled in Sinclair's ship.  *We* don't have that tech
yet, and must work around it, but a few others do.  As with the other
note I left on another topic, I don't see the problem here.  This seems
perfectly within the realm of probability for any reasonably advanced
species; it's just that we haven't reached that point yet.

Subject: Coverage in STARLOG
Date: 19 Feb 1995 20:43:24 -0500

     Clarifications and elaborations upon your note.
 
     I wasn't addressing articles "on spec," which I know they don't much
buy over there.  But there are many, many article writers who use the
same interview for different magazines, sometimes avoiding competing
marketplaces, sometimes in different countries.  There are some writers
working out of the UK who interview me, and the material ends up in
Starburst or TV Zone or other magazines there.  A writer may be on an
assignment from Sci-Fi Universe or Cinefantastique, and may also write
for Starlog.  My request to those writers is that you can use any interview
with me for any of those publications except Starlog.
 
     While I know that Starlog has, from time to time, done articles on
other shows, or the rare insightful piece, it remains almost primarily a
Star Trek/Paramount flack.  At the moment, I'm holding the current issue
in my hands.  It has *18 pages* of Star Trek related ads; Patrick Stewart
wall plaques; Patrick Stewart Photo Book; Star Trek Collector's Chess Set;
Deep Space Nine Magazine; Star Trek mouse pads; Picard figures; Seatrek
95; Cruise Trek; Star Trek pins; Star Trek conventions; Star Trek
soundtracks; Brent Spiner records; TNG magazine; TNG holographic t-shirts;
Star Trek posters; more Star Trek t-shirts; Star Trek Collector's
Portfolio; Star Trek blueprints; more Star Trek posters; the Voyager
magazine...all this in just ONE issue.
 
     Is there anything WRONG with any of this?  Absolutely not.  But it
does tell us a little about what they are.  And what they're not.
 
     STARLOG is not a magazine covering the science fiction media scene.
It is a Paramount/Star Trek flack publication that INCLUDES some limited
coverage of other stuff, at its whim.  Other series come on the air, and
the attitude is "Well, let's see what happens after they've been on the
air for a long time before we give them any coverage."  VOYAGER is
announced and the coverage is almost ORGASMIC...cover stories, one feature
article after another after another, in many cases before the show even
hits the airwaves.
 
     But that's different, because that's the company that buys 80% o
their advertising space.  Which, again, is fine...just don't pretend to be
something other, because the editorial policy follows the line of the
money for the ads.  Which isn't immoral, it simply is.  STARLOG has no
motivation to be responsible, or even-handed, or even accurate, when it
comes to covering non-Star Trek shows; it doesn't have to since the bulk
of its money comes from Star Trek and Paramount.  So it can operate under
the whim, or pique, of its editors more so than a more general-interest SF
magazine.
 
     I stopped cooperating with Starlog because I got tired of their
inaccuracies in interviews I participated in, tired of screwed up credits
and pictures; especially tired of cheap-shot articles that bitched about
how the last Twilight Zone series was being done so that MGM would have
enough to syndicate so they wouldn't lose their shirts, totally eliminating
the possibility that the stories told there could have ANY merit when
the financing was for profit (like Star Trek is being made by Paramount
out of their concern for the commonweal and to cure cancer)...tired of the
obvious editorial bias.  I received direct word from Starlog reporters that
there would never be a B5 cover because of the editor's pique, obviously
hoping that if such was withheld, maybe the show would die and the problem
would be obviated.  Well, we didn't go away, and now the pressure and the
obviousness of their omission has forced them into doing a B5 cover.
 
     I'm sorry, but I've worked as a journalist for publications like the
Los Angeles Times, TIME Incorporated, the Los Angeles Herald Examiner, and
I've *seen* how editors should run their bureaus.  STARLOG ain't run that
way.  It is, purely and simply, a Star Trek magazine with pretensions of
being something other.  Now, if all you want really is Star Trek coverage,
and maybe to keep informed of other stuff...that's nothing less than
spiffy.  But please don't try to convince me of anything else, because it
simply ain't so.  And the conflict of interest is so thick you could cut
it with a spoon; they know they can't piss off Paramount because if
Paramount pulled their ads on Monday, on Tuesday STARLOG would be out of
business, as opposed to magazines that may have a more general, and thus
less controlling, slate of advertisers.
 
     After my last communication with STARLOG, I'd nominally decided to
withhold ALL cooperation with the magazine, including my cast, directors,
everyone.  Subsequently, I realized that this would be unfair to those
people, who deserve some recognition for their work and publicity for
their careers.  Unlike STARLOG's editors, I don't impose my personal
pique upon my work situation.  I will withhold any personal interviews,
however.  Which probably suits them just fine anyway.
 
     So in the end...everyone's happy.
 
                                                                   jms

personality and experiences in relationships and other areas for my
work; it's hard, sometimes, because you've dealt with something in your
heart and nominally closed it...then you not only open it up, and write
it down, you watch other actors doing it.  Certain parts of the Sakai -
Sheridan axis, particularly their first meeting, and throughout that

     I don't think that using it in any way invalidates it for future use;
by exploring it once, you learn something about your feelings that you

reflection, events take on different perspectives.  It's like the
difference in writing about your parents when you're 16 vs. when you're

     "There needs to be some with god, or else what you build your life on

     Nope.  Start with many of the Founding Fathers, many of whom were
deists or freethinkers or non-believers.  Go back to pre-christianity, to
the great works of literature and art and architecture that survive to
this day.  You cannot stand in the shadow of the Pyramids, or in the
massive burial mound in New Grange (the oldest standing structure on the
planet, pre-bronze age), and not feel awe and respect for what has been
done.
 
     (Nuts, I left out the word "relationship" in the first sentence,
after "some."  Pretend you read it there.)
 
     Lots of people pretend to, or offer lip service to, or may even in
their view have "some relationship with god."  But not damned nearly
enough of them have some relationship with the suffering of their fellow
human beings.  There was our good old buddy James Watt, who said that we
don't need to preserve the forests because soon Christ will return and
eliminate the problem.
 
     Understand clearly and do not misrepresent in any reply: I have NO
problem whatsoever with believers of any stripe.  My problem emerges when
someone tells me that if I don't think as they do, my life is without
meaning or foundation.  No one is entitled to make that determination but
me.
 
     I'm an atheist.  Straight up.  I believe in the stubborn nobility of
the human being singular, the dignity and grace of our art and our
intellect and our heart.  I believe that a race which can write a sonnet,
split the atom, and walk on the moon has *nothing* to apologize for.
I believe that because we are only here for the duration of our life, and
that there is nothing after, that therefore *each* life is as precious
and valuable a resource as diamonds, and far rarer.  The Mona Lisa is of
note because there's only one.  There is only one of each of us.  To quote
from Lost Horizon, I believe there can be no greater or nobler creed than
the simplicity of, "Be *kind* to one another."  I believe that we are
stewards of our planet and brothers and sisters to the entirety of its
population.  I believe in the power of common men and women who, despite
pain and loss and overwhelming odds, can come together in common cause
and walk together into the future.  I look to World War II, where ordinary
people, starting out outgunned and unprepared for war and hit by
depression and surprise attack, shrugged off their coats, straightened
their spines, and walked off to beat the mightiest military force the
world had ever known; David facing a black-uniformed Goliath that stood
astride the planet on legs of fire and steel.  *That's* what we can do
when we make up our minds to do it.
 
     As Delenn said, we are better than we think and nobler than we
know, and at the end of the day, when we face that black, implacable
wall of death, for my money what matters is being able to look back at
one's life the way one looks at the end of a long day; did we fight our
own battles, were we as kind as we could be, did we move the future a
little closer, did we uplift and ennoble and enrich?

down his life for his brother."  In the case of Ramirez, or the crew of
the Narn cruiser in "Acts of Sacrifice," it's true regardless of whether
the person is an atheist or an alien race.
 
     Your question is framed around the premise of "who serves god?" but
my concern is "who serves humanity?"  One may be a monk and remain in
a monestary, and speak once in a dozen years, and serve god through the
daily effort and daily prayers that are the beginning and end of his
days.  One may be an atheist who gives to charity, helps build homes for
the homeless, and helps his fellows where possible.  The former serves
only himself; the latter serves humanity.  Both may approach their bed
at night with a clear conscience within the dictates of their beliefs.
(And yes, obviously those are two extreme examples, I'm not trying to
describe one camp or the other in such all-encompassing terms.)
 
     That which I choose to build my life upon will not "collapse"
because it has met the criteria I set for it.  I've told my stories,
touched other people; daily I receive letters from people who say that
my show has inspired them to begin careers in the sciences, or helped
them to deal with the death of a parent, or were moved by the sacrifices
portrayed in this show to give a little of themselves and switch to major
in social sciences or social work, or to become involved in charities.
The good work of this series will continue long after I am gone, and that
cannot be taken away, cannot collapse.  It is already done.
 
     And in the end, yes, all we have is the question of whether we go
with dignity and honor, knowing that we have lived our lives with passoin
(passion) and compassion in equal measure.  For me, that knowledge is
enough to sustain me when the game is finally called on account of
darkness.
 
     You do not have to believe as I do.  I do not consider your choice
a vain or foolish one, or attempt to invalidate it, or suggest that it
will collapse of its own weight.  All I ask is the same in response.
 
     Do not consider this a flame, for it is not meant as such; only as
a most...vigorous response.

     The Sanctuary is where Sheridan and the Emperor had their lengthy
conversation; it's *all* a virtual set except the floor.

     My sense is that B5 is constantly being fixed, and improved, and made
more liveable, so there will be changes in quarters, new areas opening up,
and the like (which covers Earhart's).  Though if we ever have a B5 Grand
Opening for a Wall-Mart, I'm leaving....

     Reminder to everyone...the more nominations are spread around between
lots of different episodes, the less the chance of any one of them getting
nominated or winning the thing.  If this is really something y'all want to,
do...think hard.
