Subject: ATTN JMS: ANFaW "Cold Equation
Date: 9 May 1995 01:28:54 -0400

     I don't see *any* similarity whatsoever.  "Cold Equations" was most
definitely NOT about a "teenager who accidentally 'spaces' himself."  For
starters it was a girl, but MOST important, in "Cold Equations," it was a
deliberate *choice* to walk out the airlock.  The whole premise of the
story is that the young girl stows away on a ship bringing vaccine to a
colony world.  Only other person on the ship is the pilot.  The ship is
stripped down for speed; there's only enough fuel for the pilot, the ship,
and the landing.  If she stays, the ship will run out of fuel on or just
before re-entry, they'll die and the colonists will die.  If the pilot
sacrifices himself, she can't land the ship on her own, same result.  So
she must make the conscious decision to sacrifice herself to save the
others, because you can't argue with math.
 
     That is absolutely different from somebody screwing around and
accidentally getting blown out an airlock.

     Actually, no, believe or not the arc really hasn't changed much; it's
gotten filled out a bit in places, but the direction hasn't altered.  I
had always had kind of a (?) in the thing as to how to transition clearly
from Sinclair to the Shadows, because I needed some way to connect the
stories, but having Sinclair have a hook to the shadows just strained
credulity past the breaking point.  Gradually I figured out a way to do
that, and that (?) was filled.  Other than that, no; it's going where it
was always going.

Subject: To JMS: Stop the Conspiracy St
Date: 10 May 1995 05:04:16 -0400

     Short answer: No.
 
     Medium answer, from Rod Serling, when a device he created for a
fictional story (a bomb wired to a plane set to detonate when the plane
dropped below a given altitude) ended up being used in real life: "A
writer cannot be held accountable for the pathology of fools."
 
     Long answer....
 
     Fiction ain't the problem.  To say that it is "immoral" for SF
writers to tell stories about government conspiracies is not only contrary
to the very nature of fiction and SF in particular, it also misses the
point by a thousand miles.
 
     It isn't that folks in the backwoods have been watching TV shows or
reading novels about fictional government conspiracies...it's that some
folks have been making "documentaries" and writing tracts that are
supposed to be THE TRUTH about what's going on.
 
     It isn't fiction that's the problem...it's G. Gordon Liddy telling
people that if they're going to shoot at ATF officers they ought to aim
at the head because they wear flak jackets...it's Jesse Helms who told
the press that if Clinton ever came to his state the Pres better bring a
bodyguard with him...it's Rush Limbaugh and his other ilk who for years
have been making the distinction between Liberals and Americans...it's
fanatical elements within the Religious Right who feel the need to create
vast government conspiracies that say the government is going to come and
stamp the Number of the Beast on their forehead any moment now....
 
     A climate of fear and paranoia and disloyalty for the crime of
disagreement has been created and fostered by those who have most to
gain from it.  And now they are trying to run from what they have done.
It ain't TV shows about stuff happening in the far future.  I don't think
anyone out there watching B5 has any belief whatsoever that this stuff is
real, and present, and can be responded to.  If there are one or two
lunatics who might possibly read something into it, they could do so to
ANY program, regardless of content.  People have committed crimes and
murder and gone insane because of things in the Bible...should we therefore
ban the Bible?  One recent movie-goer was killed because he got the last
bag of popcorn at a movie theater, and another patron was pissed off
about it.  Should we ban popcorn?  There's nothing you can do that someone
won't read something into.  Should we destroy all storytelling out of the
fear that somewhere, someone MIGHT be provoked by it?  You can't live in
fear.
 
     Your concern obviously grows out of the Oklahoma situation, but this
has no bearing upon that whatsoever.  The problem is poverty, and
ignorance, and political rhetoric, and manipulation in the real world,
not the fictional one.
 
     A TV writer can turn an audience against a killer, a stalker, a
criminal.
 
     It takes a politician to turn us against ourselves.

that TV people don't have an original idea in their head, and can ony
(only) borrow from other people.
 
     Though I may sometimes nod to one or another landmark of SF, I'm not
doing the Prisoner, Lord of the Rings, Childhood's End, MacBeth, the
Illiad, The Mountains of Madness, or any of the thirty other works that
I'm supposed to be doing, all mutually contradictory.  I'm telling this
story, my story, and though it's nice to be compared to such other works,
it does become bothersome after a while when everybody tries to pin down
which work I'm supposed to be "doing" when they NEVER do this to novelists,
because this is TV.  C'mon, people, I've written published novels, and
short stories, and plays, and radio dramas, and I *do* have a brain in my

only that I've seen this gag pulled before, where somebody comes in, posts
a message that gets an argument going, gets ganged up on, and then says
he or she is being "threatened" or intimidated in some way, in order to
play the victim (and also win an unwinnable argument) and get people on
his/her side.
 
     In all the years I've been on the nets, I haven't encountered one real
case of this, and given the nature of discussion on this forum, there have
been *real major* flamewars which cause this one to pale into
insignificance, and if THOSE didn't provoke such calls, I don't see why
this one would, all of a sudden.

that we'll be delivering all the finished episodes in time for the UK to

     Some quickies....
 
     1) Claudia Christian, Bill Mumy and I will be appearing (on various
days/times) at the Creation MegaShow to be held at the Anaheim Convention
Center, in California, May 27-28.  I don't know when they'll be up, but
I'm slated for Sunday.  (Plus Mark Hammil, Stan Lee and some Voyager
folks.)
 
     2) Parents with small kids who watch B5 may want to consider
screening the next episode, "Confessions and Lamentations," first, in
order to determine how to talk to your kids about it.  It's a *very*
intense episode and uncompromising.
 
     3) Yes, as discussed elsewhere here, Warners has scheduled the last
four episodes of this season to run in October, to build momentum toward
what (we hope) will be the season three debut, though no official word
has yet been given on year three.

Subject: B5 Book 3: Blood Oath
Date: 21 May 1995 03:59:12 -0400

     As stated, all of the B5-related items -- books, comics, merchandise,
you name it -- go through my hands.  Usually I have only minor notes; in
some cases, I have more substantive notes.  Nobody's fault, it just
happens.  When you've got diverse hands tugging the B5 universe in various
directions, sooner or later someone's going to go down the wrong road.  It
is my job, and responsibility, to pull it back when that happens.  That's
the whole point.
 
     Book #3 had, as stated, gone down some wrong roads, and needed to be
brought back into alignment with the series.  I had a substantial number
of notes.  Not John's fault, it just Is.  Or Was.  The revisions required
to bring the book back into line were going to be enough to push back the
publication date by a month or two.  Dell wasn't exactly thrilled with
the idea.  I insisted.  We went back and forth.  Finally, the revisions
were implemented.  Hence the slight delay.  (The revised manuscript has
already come and gone through my office, and been approved, thanks to
John's careful revisions.)
 
     No relation to the other PTEN stuff; this is just jms being a pain in
the ass.  But that's part of the process, so that when you see something
with the B5 name on it, you know it's been done reasonably right.

known there would be such a glut...well, I probably would've done so
anyway, because this isn't so much about the plague and saying its'
dangerous, but about our attitudes when we are confronted by this, which
really hasn't been dealt with that much in SF.  (And I'm sorry, but

     Actually, the chronological order was *supposed* to be "Knives," THEN

"Z'ha'dum" you get the payoff.  That was originally how they were intended
to be aired, but there was *so much* CGI work and rotoscope work and
creature animation involved in "Knives" that it got flopped to second in
that order.  So while it works *best* the way it was intended, it still
works okay in this order.

Subject: "Rip-Offs" and Con Organizing;
Date: 24 May 1995 20:51:23 -0400

     I would venture that there has been some change in the tone and
attitude of some conventions over the years, not always favorable.  Now,
bear in mind, I've been a fan of SF for all my life, I've gone to cons
for well over 15 years as Just Another Guy, so in some of this I have my
Fanboy hat on, though from time to time my Producerboy hat may slip on
as well.
 
     There are some conventions I never miss; LosCon here in LA, and San
Diego Comic Con, because both have a sense of real fun about them, and
the people running them are generally swell (absent one or two years of
LosCon when, I dunno, something went weird at the ConCom level).  As a
rule, Westercon is great, Icon is great, and though I haven't had that
much exposure to Chicago ComicCon, that seems pretty nifty as well.
 
     But over the years, at some other conventions (not all of them, but
a growing number), you start to run into a problem in fan/pro
relationships.  One convention I know of (no names) didn't bother to send
out invitations to the pros or offer guest passes because "Well, they
always come every year ANYway, so why spend the money on stamps?  BECAUSE
IT'S POLITE TO BE ASKED, YOU NUMBSKULL.  Consequently, a number of pros
passed and didn't come.
 
     I've had a real problem with a couple of recent WorldCons, where I
shelled out my own money as a pro with a whole lotta TV SF credits to
fly up, paid for my own room, transportation, everything...and was told
upon arrival that even having done all this, and after they'd used my
name to bring in more people, they WOULDN'T EVEN GIVE ME A GUEST PASS to
the convention.  I had to pay to get in.  When they pulled this one on me
in San Francisco, I chewed those involved several new orifices, and only
went to the one panel I really wanted to do, and otherwise said "screw
it."
 
     More and more, it seems, conventions which rely on pros to draw
attendees adopt a give-a-shit attitude toward those pros, as though tyey
(they) are *expected* to perform, and should be happy for the chance to
appear anywhere.  I cannot tell you the number of calls I get from people
putting cons together *right now* that explain, "Yes, we want you as our
GoH, but you'll have to pay your own way at every step," often including
buying admission.  When you protest, they get snippy and say, "Well, you
know, we're doing this for YOUR benefit, to give you exposure to your
show to the fans, we're doing you a favor."
 
     At which point I usually hang up the phone hard enough to shatter
phone lines from here to New Orleans.
 
     Now let me repeat...this is not the standard, but it has been
happening enough, and growing, that a lot of pros are having second
thoughts about the whole convention idea.  A number of 'em just won't go
anymore...and where that's unfortunate is that it hurts the goodly number
of great conventions put on by terrific people, and there are many.
 
     It's caused me to be very selective in the conventions I attend, and
I work hard with my cast, who are new to all this, to try and help them
avoid any that I know are going to be trouble.
 
     I'm not sure what the root of the problem is, whether it's some fans
taking pros for granted, or the growth of cons as Big Business rather than
just a chance to have fun and hang out, or what.  So I can't even begin to
describe what needs to be done, only to agree with Paul that there is a
problem, but to disagree with him on the notion that there aren't good ones
out there.  Yes, you can be taken advantage of, and that happens more than
it should in every area, and SF cons are no exception.  But I don't think
it's time yet to throw the proverbial baby out with the proverbial
bathwater.
 
                                                                  jms

radically different than our own.  Until we actually make contact, it's
as likely as not."  A biologist works from what's known; unless you've got
a specimen of alien life somewhere and aren't showing it to anyone, or
you're simply making a guess, which is neither more nor less correct until
we have something testable in our hands.

     Dan'l...you make a lot of good points. The only one I'd argue with
is the "Worldcon is an exhibition, and all attendees at businsss
exhibitions pay to get in."  (Paraphrase)  Not true.  Invariably, any
good exhibition of business convention allows for industry passes; I was
at E3, the big multimedia exhibition/convention in LA a week or so ago,
with 30-40,000 attendees, and media pros/industry types were comp'd,
because it's the presence of these individuals that brings in others.  If
Worldcon is, as you say, more a business than a convention (which is
on one level kinda less than it was intended, he said wistfully), then
it should begin acting like one.

     1) Tom C. informed me that arrangements had been made with Capricon
for the bunch of us to appear there on Saturday, though explaining that it
"couldn't be put into the program because we didn't have an exact time."
Which seemed kinda funny to me at the time.
 
     2) Upon arriving, at Tom's insistence (I at no time even knew about
the convention until Tom told us we were booked to stop by as a "goodwill
investment"), it did seem that *nobody* knew we were coming, which upset
me more than a little.
 
     3) I did insist on a room rather than being stuck in the dealer's
room, at a table selling unauthorized merchandise.
 
     4) As we left the convention, I had a very angry conversation with
Tom, in that insufficient groundwork had been done, no preparations or
arrangements had been made, and the entire thing was sloppily done, and
that it couldn't be allowed to be done this way again.

in the Narn/Centauri war.

     Here's a dilemma I'd like to throw out to those who've run conventions
before, because I don't have a good answer for it, and maybe it'd help to
illuminate the discussion a bit.
 
     I was talking to X, who is a prime mover behind one of the for-profit
convention companies.  I noted, in the course of the conversation, my
surprise that Actor Y had not been invited to many conventions by that
company.  X's response: "Well, that's because Actor Y keeps showing up at
fan conventions for free.  How can we justify paying someone who's lowered
his/her market value like that?"
 
     Initial reaction: that's rather odious thinking.
 
     Secondary and tertiary reactions: you're an actor.  You don't really
come out of the SF field, you don't know the ins and outs, or what the
diff is between a fan con and a profit con.  Convention A asks you to do
their convention, and will pay $4,000 plus transportation and airfare.
Convention B asks you to their convention, but can't pay anything but the
hotel and a guest pass.  Actors are not limitless pools of money; they
have the same fiscal nuts to crack as everyone else...mortgage, car,
alimony, kids, doctors, name it.
 
     It does put things very much in the favor of the paying cons when it
comes to actors and the like.  How does one tell an actor not to do it?
(Not that it is my job or anyone else's to do so, and I'm not entirely
sure it would be *right* to do so...any opportunity an actor has to
perform for an audience, and be properly compensated for that performance,
should be seized.)  So maybe it isn't so much "don't do this one," as "be
OPEN to the other type as well."  But then how do you counter the X/Y
conversation above?
 
     It is, frankly, a real mess....
 
                                                                  jms

     I think it's more a case of those species who might find B5 a

diversification as the techniques to realize that dramatically continue
to increase.

Subject: PC Babylon
Date: 27 May 1995 05:48:26 -0400

     PC's got nothing to do with it.  But 1) the syph epidemic didn't
occur to me, and 2) this was nowhere NEAR the level of plague that we were
addressing.  It didn't occur to me while writing it, and if it had, I
probably would've excluded it because it wasn't relevant.  I would also
add that *all* sides in this particular storyline acted with varying
degrees of irrationality, so if there was one side or the other held up
as wiser or better, I sure didn't see it.  Or write it.
 
     There are legitimate complaints one can bring of political
correctness.  Unfortunately, it has gained such wide currency, and is
used so broadly in non-applicable areas, that the term has lost most of
its meaning and effectiveness.  Nowadays PC is meant to mean anything one
disagrees with, anything with a possible moral or idea, to denigrate
anything and everything but absolute rudeness.  It's a dismissive, nothing
more.

     Actually, I don't tend to use the hospitality suite much at cons;
I generally hang out in the halls or in the dealer's room or in going to
panels, rather than hiding out.  I also don't tend to eat much before a
presentation as it kafuffles my synapses and all I can do is stand there
and belch (which, granted, is some small improvement over my usual
performance).

     It's probably a glitch in my brain, but I rarely evaluate conventions
in terms of how "useful" they are, but rather if I and folks seem to have
a good time.  So in that sense, I probably enjoy the fan-cons more, because
there's more room for interaction.

     The only thing wrong with this whole argument is that it doesn't touch
reality at any two contiguous points.  I will not defend the notion that
the episode stated that all Americans felt that AIDS was a penalty from
god because it never said that.  Ever.  In any way, manner, shape or form.
The problem is that some people are so caught up in the current situation
that they lose all sense of perspective.  Fact is, most people DID think
that the Black Death was a punishment from God, or the work of the devil,
as Franklin says.  The Markabs had a similar belief.  Nowhere was that
applied in dialogue to humans or the AIDS situation.
 
     The whole point of the episode is NOT political; it says that if you
make a disease political on either side, you're gonna die.  You have to
set aside all that crap and just Deal With The Problem.  The only "side"
this episode took was in advocating compassion for those afflicted.
 
     I have enough just dealing with what's actually *in* my series; don't
compound the problem by adding things that you saw only in your own head,
and which exist nowhere in dialogue or in the story.  You are adding the
template of your own beliefs as an overlay, and seeing this story through
it.  That ain't my problem.  If you see this disease as political, that's
your lookout.  This show says that ANY attempt to politicize a disease is
species-dangerous thinking.  Period.
