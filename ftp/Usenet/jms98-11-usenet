Subject: Re: Attn JMS: Who's Fiona Avery?

Fiona came aboard as our continuity editor to help keep all of the B5 licensing
stuff as canon as humanly possible.  So that means learning all she can about
the B5 and Crusade universes, second probably only to me.  

A couple of months ago or so, she wrote a spec Crusade script just to see if
she could do it, as an experiment, never intended or figured we'd buy it.  I
read it...and walked into John Copeland's office and said, "Am I nuts, or is
this as good as I think it is?"  He read it, said it was great...and we bought
it, plus one more.

We've complained to TNT about this; it does seem to be a recurring problem,
caused by the folks doing the broadcast stuff Not Paying Attention To The Cue

It is, to say the least...infuriating.

Subject: Sidelights (from jms)

1) I spoke to TNT in more detail about the commercial weirdnesses in The River
of Souls, and apparently the problem was not their fault.  The processing
company that does transfers from our digibeta masters to what they can air puts
timecode on the tape; that timecode is used to calibrate where commercials go
from the format we provide.  The timecode was off by quite a bit, so when they
put in the commercials, they were in the wrong spots.

2) Interesting note...I've now heard from about a dozen people who've seen
"Sleeping in Light" (critics and friends of critics who got advance copies). 
And with at most one or two exceptions, every single one of them has been doing
the same thing: running the last 8 minutes or so (from the start of act 4
through to the very end credits) over and over and over, 5-6 times or more.  I
find that interesting because that's *exactly* what I've been doing with it
since getting the final tape in my hands.  I'm not sure exactly what motivates
it, but there's something going on there that hits home across the board.  I
was astonished to hear that others were doing the same thing I was in this
respect.  Will be curious to see if others have the same reaction.

There are two parts of writing an episode: the basic storyline, sometimes
presented as an outline, and then the actual script which is a more specific
elaboration on that story.  Story is, "King John and Queen Mary live in the
castle and they have a hard night between them."

Script is: 

EXT. CASTLE - NIGHT
We see the banners unfurling in the breeze, and go to

INT. CASTLE - NIGHT
KING JOHN and QUEEN MARY are in bed.  He's awake, she's sleeping.  He looks up
at the ceiling.

No, long before.  We shot it at the end of season 5, and Thirdspace was not

Subject: Re: Attn JMS: Start date for Crusade?

Because 108 is now the slated fist episode, so that we can use it to introduce
the new characters rather than jump in in-progress, it means it will take
longer to complete the CGI and stuff than 103, since it was shot later.  TNT
needs the eps a month or two prior ot airdate for critics...and there's the
concern about showing only 4 episodes in March (which is when it would all be
rady) and thenbeing cut off for 8 weeks by the NBA playoffs.

So they figured going June 2nd would avoid all of the problems, and put the
show out when the network shows were in reruns...meaning it has a better chance
of scoring large numbers, a strategy that worked well with other shows like
90210.

Actually, that's already started.  A number of academic essays on B5 have been
collected in "The Parliament of Dreams," published in the UK (I think someone
here may have the info on purchasing it).  I found in reading it that I was
smarter, stupider, more liberal, more conservative, more progressive, more
reactionary, than I had previously imagined.

Such analysis (and it was/is good reading, btw) is flattering, sometimes
daunting, but brings out stuff always worth considering.  Whether the subject
matter is in the long run truly worth the ink, only history can tell. 
Obviously I think so, but again, I have a vested interest in saying that.

No...it may come as a surprise, but I don't get a direct cut in any way of the
sales of videotapes (for whatever reason, Hollywood doesn't consider that
merchandising, so I don't get it that way).  The only thing I get -- thanks to

crap.  You didn't provide any closure.  Instead of spending time with the
hobbits clearing out the shire (come on, urban renwal in LoTR? give me a break)

he was an important part of the story, and you just left his story thread there

You made a big deal out of the elves going to the west, but we never SAW it! 
We never found out what was there, or what Bilbo found when he got there, or
what happened to the dwarves, or what happened to Merry and Pippin....

You betrayed your audience by not resolving every single plot thread you

There are weapons systems on board that station, computer systems, other stuff

setting up residence there, or raiding the place for what they can get, and
maintaining a military presence there to prevent it would be expensive.  With

I don't see how sending a 5 mile long station plummeting into the atmosphere of

crews can come in and take the metal.  We already *saw* bits of the debris

They're apples and oranges.  You really can't compare them.  For the bulk of
B5, there *was* no interference, and I could write as I wanted.  Yeah, you have
actors leaving and the like, but sometimes you can be halfway through a novel
and realize you need to drop somebody...and go back and revise 200 pages.  

Both are processes, neither is set in stone the first time you sit down to
begin the actual writing.  Some tools are better meant for one form or the
other, but the process is pretty much the same in both.  So I like working in
both, equally, just for different reasons.
