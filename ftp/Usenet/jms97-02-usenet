:I am unaware of any *deliberate* attempt to have people tortured to
authenticate information. The deception consisted of several elements."

That you may not be aware of it does not mean it's incorrect.

I ran across this information in an article in The Los Angeles Times about
8 years ago.  It was something of a big deal because the situation had
been kept secret ever since the war, and when it came out it caused a
great deal of distress (and discussion) about the ethics involved.

I called a couple of other people who I talked to when the article first
came out, and their recollection of it is the same as mine.

I'll try and get around to doing a search on the LA Times database, to see
if I can find the exact references, though I don't know if their search
engine goes back that far.

Mojo:

I will point out to you that in my original message, I never even
MENTIONED Foundation, or referred to it in any way, manner, shape or form.

You did that on your own.  You made baseless statements about our entire
EFX team coming from Foundation, when you know this is an absolute and
utter fabrication on your part.  

If you've got a problem with this topic being brought up, it's you who did
it, so take your concerns to the mirror.

Me, I'm out of this.

"All I can say is that Joe REALLY doesn't know how to take a sarcastic
comment in good stride!"

Maybe, in future, if you didn't just drop in "sarcastic comments"
randomly, you wouldn't have problems like this.  Every time I have made a
positive comment about the EFX this season, you have jumped in with
sarcasm.  Grow up, Mojo.

Meanwhile, as far as I'm concerned, this thread is over.

 1.) The CGI was excellent and seemed very different than in previous
episodes, much larger, better defined, darker.  Was this an effort on
your part, or the post-production department?

We're trying some new rendering techniques...I think they're working very
well.  (Some of the stuff in the next episode has a very realistic feel to
it.)

  2.) Have you found some way to slow down time or compress the episode
into a shorter span?  When I finished this one, I swore I had watched a
two hour movie.

You did.  We arranged for a time dilation bubble to appear over your
house.

  3.) Any reaction from the actor or staff on this one?  Especially, Ed
Wassner? (Might be a bit of spoilers in the answer to this one)

Ed wants to come back as an alien.  I see no problem with this.

Subject: Re: ATTN: JMS   <spoilers for #406>

Ghar...your comments are well and good and have nothing to do with
reality.

First, the Rangers situation is not a typical military situation.  They
are primarily from Minbar, both in terms of actual Minbari and humans
trained there.  They are specifically under Delenn's charge, with Sheridan
*sharing* that authority.  He did not know Ericsson because they're a
large bunch to whom he has not been introduced, and likely they don't have
very large records on them.  This is a *de facto* army, not a *de jure* (I
hope I spelled that right) army...there ain't a lot of paperwork on the
Rangers.

Second, it was Delenn who sent for this particular White Star, more for
its strategic location...which Sheridan used because it was closest to the
goal.  Your observation is like saying that General Patton should know
*instantly* about every soldier on the line in battle, however distant he
is.  Which is simply absurd.  Watch some old WW2 footage someday...there's
General MacArthur walking among some troops..."What's your name, son? 
Where are you from?"  By your lights, he should have known that.  

Third, re: the encryption notice...of *course* they're all
encrypted...what Sheridan said was "we're RE-encrypting this message EVERY
THREE SECONDS, so be sure to have your system keep up."  That's an
escalation in layers of encryption so elaborate and involved that it makes
the system actually slow down.

Before you start flaming, I suggest you stop and consider what you're
saying some time, and that there may be other elements at work beyond just
what you THINK should be the case.

through this process.

Subject: jms thinkpad story: end notes

Just a follow-up since a few have asked....

A while back, I posted about the IBM Thinkpad 560 that I bought, which
went kablooey within 24 hours and could not be fixed, and the multiple
incompetent attempts to make it work by techs who had never touched this
model before.  I vented here in my frustration about it all.

Well, what then happened was that a Very Nice Man named Robert Kirk at IBM
heard about this, and intervened.  Through his own resources, he had it
checked out thoroughly, and discovered that the motherboard was wired
wrong, and badly, with some connections not fully made, so it'd work one
minute, and not the next.

It's subsequently been replaced, and it has been running fine ever since. 
I've held back saying anything more until I was sure...but it's a fine
little machine, now that it's working.

Sometimes, as with any bureaucracy, you have to get their attention, and
that's what the nets are good for.  I heard from several others who had to
go through similar steps..and if you plink them in public, they will
sometimes do what they will never do for you in private.

as with B5.

things.  It's not just about solving the technical problem that way...it's
about the people who solve the problem and how they are affected by the
problems and solutions.

Subject: Re: ATTN JMS: Comparison to "Lucifer's Hammer"

I agree, it's often the aftermath that holds the greatest interest.  The
Civil War tells one kind of interesting story; the Reconstruction that
followed, which endured for many years longer than the war, tells another,
just as interesting story.

There's a line one of the characters will say soon, "The duration's going
to be a lot longer than the war."  It's a very true comment.

One of my favorite books is "Alas, Babylon," by Pat Frank, which is about
a nuclear war (written in the early 60s).  But the war happens entirely
off-stage, way in the distance...and the book focuses on one small
township dealing with the after effects, and the day-to-day realities of
surviving in a changed world.  I've always been partial to that kind of
storytelling.

"Was this your intention - to get a response from those of us who follow
the Sheridan and Delenn story line closely? Some how, I feel manipulated
and very disappointed."

Yes, as I sat in the editing room, I thought, "Hmmm...if I do this, it'll
get the Sheridan and Delenn fans' knickers all in a knot...."

Every scene goes through some editing...there is barely a scene we film
that doesn't get a line or two or three snipped.  Sometimes the edit is
noticeable, sometimes it ain't.  The only thing you can decide is, "Does
this move the story along or not?"  I was chasing about another 20 seconds
(which was all we're talking about here), and the back-and-forth didn't
really add anything to what was already in that scene.  I treated it the
same as I would treat any other scene.

I'll also be at Megacon in Orlando, Florida in about a month.

Preliminary, unofficial word is that we got a 4.1 rating for the second
new episode, our highest in 2 years.

Also, the new issue of Sci-Fi Universe has two articles by Stephen Smith,
one of which, a week following the production of B5, is probably the best
and most comprehensive article ever written on the subject.  I commend it
wholeheartedly.

Finally, Antioch Publishing is hitting the bricks shortly with a line of

Subject: Re: ATTN JMS: Question about B5 novels

In the past, we've taken pitches, but overall I've felt that the books
strayed too far from canon by doing it that way; the latest batch were
more directly influenced.  One is taken right out of B5 canon, the
Anna/Icarus story, and it's one of the best to date; the second one up is
based on a premise I wrote up and was assigned to the writer (it's the
weakest of the three, set on Centauri Prime while G'Kar was still held
prisoner, but still okay); the third is also based on a premise, and
follows Sinclair after leaving B5 to form the Rangers...I worked very
closely with the writer here to ensure that virtually *every line* is
canon.  Frankly, if anyone asks from now on, "What happened to Sinclair
after leaving B5?" I can point to this book and say, honestly, "It's all
in there."

I think we'll continue to work this way more in future.

Dell only works with published authors with agents and credits.

I just saw the first message I can remember from George Johnsen, B5

was signed George Johnsen <ndeiprod@earthlink.net>.

For those interested in the details of post-production -- sound, music,
editing, CGI, other stuff -- George is the guy to ask.  George is
one-third of the Terrible Triumverate without which B5 would not happen,
and even if it did happen, wouldn't be a fraction as good as it is.  (The
other two being me, one presumes, and John Copeland, one fears.)

Everybody join in welcoming George...make him feel at home...and feel free
to ask him all the technical questions you've considered asking me, but
knew you wouldn't get back an even reasonably intelligent reply.  (Insert
evil laughter here.)

(George also makes a *great* convention speaker, incidentally.  Simply a
word to the wise.)

George also did the closing voice-over in season 1 of B5, by the way.

What I have said about this from the beginning, and the ONLY thing I have

that could go off from the main story.  That has been quoted in many
different places, and on line, and definitely includes any plans for
"Crusade."

published over there shortly, to coincide with new episodes), then it will
be gathered together and published in the US by DC Comics.  The books are

If it's a little close to home...you have to remember I came out of

newspapers and magazines.  You see a lot of the tricks, some good, some
not so good, used for purposes that are sometimes good or not so good,
distortions on the left and distortions on the right. So it wasn't hard to
just tweak it a bit.

Thing to remember, though, is that this isn't ISN as we've known it in the
past, at least not to this extreme.  If anything, this ep should point to
the difference between journalism, albeit biased, and propaganda, which is
all ISN is now, and how only an informed viewership can prevent the one

Subject: Re: Attn JMS: audio problem during "The Illusion of Truth"

Hey Folks-

The audio problem on TIoT was caused by the uplink at the uplink
facility that Warners is using this year.  This facility is not all
digital, like our facility was last year, and these analog-y problems
creep in from time to time.  The buzzing mentioned happened specifically
on the "hypertext" captions (tell the truth, how many people touched the
button pads?), and was caused by the audio channel being too close to
video with a high white level.  (Video pro alert- yes i know this is an
overly simplified explanation) 

WB is in the process of fixing the problem.

Any of the other mentioned problems, voices shooting off into the
surrounds, steering effects in stereo, dialog level fluctuations are a
local phenomenon.

Subject: Re: ATTN GEORGE:  Equipment question

Hey, Lee-

Whoa- sounds more like a lightwave mailing list question! :-)

The arsenal looks like the following- 

Alphas for design stations serving 5 animators and one animation
assistant (housekeeping and slate specialist).  Most of these stations
run Lightwave and a couple add Softimage.  VERY plug-in hungry.  PVR's
on every station, with calibrated component NTSC (darn it, I hates ntsc)
right beside.

P6's in quad enclosures for part of the renderstack, and Alphas for the
rest, backed up 2x per day to an optical jukebox.

Completed shots output to a DDR post rendering and get integrated into
the show.

Shots to composite go to the Macs running After Effects, or the SGI
running Flint, depending on the type of comp being done, and then to the
DDR (8 minutes capacity on the SGI).

Boy it sure sounds easy!  The only problem is, we have a killer schedule
and very picky producers, and ESPECIALLY picky viewers! :-)

It is, however, a bunch of fun!

Subject: Re: Attn GEORGE: Interceptors

Mark-

The interceptors have two components, one that throws a ball of energy
at an incoming weapons charge (physical or energy) and causes
dissipation, and the other is a net-like energy web that reduces the
severity, but does not deflect or absorb, beam type energy.  This allows
some time for maneuvers after beam contact.  

Note that Major Ryan (He'll always be D-Day to my brother!) was very
reticent to fire on the Clarkstown at all.  Knowing that the
Interceptors were down made his job all the more difficult.  The rear
facing beamn on the Alexander is similar in design to the front facers
on the Clarkstown.  When the C-town fired on the rotating section ofthe
Alexander, it did not explode, as the interceptors were still active.

Hey Tom!

Even though the Joe uses "another" platform, the show actually uses
many!  Macs have been essential to the creation of the show from the
beginning.  Even farther back, the Amiga and the Newtek Toaster were
employed.  

Currently we use Pentiums and Alphas for animation, Macs for Editing,
Matte paintings and Compositing, and SGI's for Compositing and titling. 
If that isn't platform independent, I don't know what is!

Jeff-

The ISN cameras are not capable of autonomous operation, but they can be
progammed within a parameter set.  The wand is a control device to
change those parameters.  Thus, one operator, two cameras (or more!)

There was a distinct anti Minbar/Minbari sentiment among this particular
crew, as evidenced by the later parts of the show, and it isn't hard to
imagine that the bumping was at the behest of the wand wielder.  If
Lennier was simply annoyed, advantage ISN.  If he reacted violently,
advantage ISN. I'm sure that footage will be used on another ISN

The line about meaning what you say is an old saying that goes 'way, way
back, long before the O'Toole movie.  And as far as Caligula goes, the
sense of it is there, but not the details...and even if they *were*,
basing part of a story on historical precedent, on actual events, is
hardly inappropriate.  (And in this case, again, it isn't based on
that...evocative of it, yes, but nothing more.)

The notion of the Vorlons and Shadows representing Order and Chaos goes
back to the Babylonian creation myths, that the universe was born in the
conflict between order and chaos, hence part of the reason I decided to
name this show after Babylon.  That's called *research*.  It informs the
show, but it is not the show.

Happy to explain.

"And now this letter comes out from your company which seems to imply
there won't be a fifth season."

NDEI is not my company.  I don't own it, don't work for it, it's entirely
Doug's separate company.  With a stockholder's meeting coming up, he told
his financial PR person to pump out a release to get a little heat
going...and there was the TNT deal to pick up the B5 episodes that clicked
over at 88 episodes.  That is the point at which they can get the show
clean, and there's the two movies for TNT to announce as go projects.  

The financial PR person put this out, rather than the B5 publicists, or
WB, and it never went in front of me or John Copeland.  It just went out. 
That TNT gets access to 88 doesn't preclude a possible season 5, which
could air concurrently, a la the way Lazarus Man did.  

When I came in and found email on this, and saw the release, I raised hell
with Doug about it.  He said "the entire 88 episodes" just refers to
what's solid right now, it doesn't mean it's going to be all there is...to
which I said it could be read that way, and many people *were* reading it
that way, and his person could've saved everyone a lot of hassle if it'd

Andras-

Cineon is not the only processor to have a grain remover/grain adder
module in the software.  The discreet logic Flint, Adobe After Effects,
and Lightwave 3D used on B5 also have various modules and plugins for
grain manipulation.  We use 'em all the time on composite and blue
screen shots to make the generated elements fit into the film elements.

We shoot with Panavision Gold super 35.  We have tested nearly all of
the emultions currently available, and 5298 is what John Flinn III, ASC
likes the best, so that is what we use.  He feels it preserves the look
he is going for the best.  I know an EXR test was scheduled, but we
haven't gotten there yet.

We record all of our CG elements to hard drive and optical disc.  The
images are created "resolution independent" meaning they could be
rendered for anything from video game to Imax, based on user input.  For
the NTSC version, we output to digital tape, eventually.

Peter-

There are most likely both types of battles you mentioned plus a few
more types we don't imagine as yet.  You will see more of the Long Range
stuff if the story dictates.  Remember that there weren't any Shadow
fighters in the scene you indicate, only battlecrabs (yes, now we call
them that, too), so the weapon size and distance could be greater.  The
element of surprise is also a player, as is the fact that these weapons
were still quite unfamiliar to those being attacked.

Our intention with the closer range battles was to convey several
dramatic things.  One, a more intense, less calculated battle.  Two, a
more personal fight for the participants, as these current fights are at
once more desperate and more monumental,  Three, these are combination
fighter and larger ship battles. In addition to the large capital ships
being involved, there are a high number of smaller, more manueverable
ships that have no reason to exist, if technology is so great that
battles can only be fought from a distance. I am convinced that the
distances displayed are plausible for fighter-type battles.  In all of
the history of pilot to pilot combat, there is always a component of the
direct engagement of the enemy.  Technology continues to advance, and
after every major advance, the battle distances expand out..... for a
time.  As soon as the pilots figure out how to react to the weapon, and
defend against it, the engagement distances close up again.

Jeanne's book is more or less of that mold; the second uses a similar

Truth: I go back and forth.  The "Into the Fire" thing, for instance...it

exactly where it ended up.  A few more big explosions, but I wonder also
if that really adds anything past a certain point.

>From a production standpoing, since "Fire" darn near killed us in the CGI

That puppy had something around 120 or 140 EFX shots.

Overall, I'm actually quite happy with how this season is going, in terms
of the intensity of the arc and the emotions and incidents.  Parts
would've been a bit more laid-back if I had decided not to cover my bets
