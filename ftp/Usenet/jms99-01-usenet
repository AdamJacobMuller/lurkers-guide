Subject: Re: ATTN JMS: Budgets, Budgets, and more budgets!!!!

The B5 tv movies produced so far cost just a tick under $3 million.

We could almost certainly do a high-quality theatrical feature for about $35-40
million.

The average going price for a feature these days is $55 million.

Subject: note from jms re: evan chen

I posted this on Compuserve...just passing this along here as well on the topic
of the music for A CALL TO ARMS.

     I suppose we could've stayed with the safe choice, with Chris, or done 
a nice, safe, droning Voyager style score that you don't even notice, but 
we're looking to take chances, and that means some people will like what you 
do, some won't.  Some won't like it because it's different.  Neil Gaiman told 
me that a number of fans of any form, including his own, say they want 
something new and challenging that takes chances...but it they don't like the 
form of that chance, they blame you for somehow doing it wrong...and they 
want the next new thing to be just like the last thing you did.

      I can't tell you the number of people who said "why can't you just do 
the John Williams style music instead of this?"  Because it's been done, and 
it's cliche, and by god we're going to push what's "expected" to try some new 
things.  Otherwise what the hell's the point?

"Of course, you've been through this before.  I seem to recall a lot of 
people complaining when Christopher Franke replaced the composer for the 
pilot.  I don't doubt that a lot of the people screaming loudest now are the 
very ones who complained about Franke when he started."

      I don't know about the latter, but I can sure confirm the former.  And 
that's why I sometimes wish the viewer responses were logged as much as my 
own have been.  When we brought in Chris to replace Stewart Copeland, you 
can't *believe* how much email I got from people saying to trash him, fire 
him, it's that "euro-trash techno-crap" most called it.  "He uses sounds and 
banging instead of music," people complained (which he did mainly in the 
first two seasons), "it's distracting and it's not appropriate, get rid of 
him."

      But we didn't.  I told people to give him time to settle into the show, 
and on the other hand to let them get used to a different kind of sound than 
what they expected.  ("I guess you couldn't afford to hire a real composer 
like TNG uses," was another popular line.)  

      Evan ain't Chris, nor should he be, nor should he *have* to be.  He is 
a brilliantly talented composer.  This is his first shot at a dramatic 
series, and as he settles in (as Chris settled in), I think people are going 
to be as loyal to what he's doing in Crusade as they were to Chris in B5.  
He's a classically trained composer, who threw it all away to come study jazz 
under some of the best jazz men in Chicago...washing dishes to support 
himself when he had been at the top of his field in China...because he loves 
music, and loves to experiment, and he took a chance.

      In the course of Crusade, we're going to see some places we've never 
seen before...and thanks to Evan, we're going to hear some things we've never 
heard before.  He's a find, and a genuine, fresh talent, and I stand behind 
him 100%.

      And the people who say they are fans of Chris Franke's should think 
twice before doing to him what so many people did so rudely to Chris when he 
first came aboard.

Standard stuff: any studio owns all the rights to the show it makes.  Paramount
owns ST, not Roddenberry's estate.  Similarly, WB owns B5, lock, stock and
docking bay.  They also own all the designs, the ship models, and all of that. 
It's all copyrighted and trademarked, down to the schematics.

So in other words, I cannot have or express an opinion of my own.  You can say

I think I'm going to end up doing fewer conventions than in previous years; to

doing a bit less than usual for the next year or so.

We pulled the book.  For a variety of reasons, it wasn't where we wanted it to
be, and the quality we needed it to be, so it was dropped.  We hope we can try
and do something else with the novelist at some point in the future.

No real impact either way...we contract with our CGI and stuff to be done by a
given date, and that date can't be expanded without additional fees, so it will
still get done in the same amount of time.

I was just thinking about how to use the changes to the benefit of the story

Yes, you have that wrong.  You have that MASSIVELY wrong, on just about every
conceivable level.  I never said what you represent above.  

Further, the majority of the conventions I do each year ARE fan run
conventions.  From Marcon to LosCon to Stellar Occasion to WishCon to a small
fan-run con in Calgary last year...from big ones to small ones, they are nearly
ALL fan-run cons.  

As for fees...there are usually fees because I'm being asked to take away a
weekend, the only time I have a chance to rest up, and fly somewhere to,
essentially, perform.  It's a very strenuous thing for me...I often lose as
much as 5-10 pounds over a weekend convention because I'm running my brains
out, sometimes from early morning to late evening with maybe a half-hour for a
fast bite at lunch and often going straight through dinner.

Even so, even with all that...it's a token fee, maybe one third what folks like
Bruce get (or even less), and it's a function of distance traveled.  For
LosCon, and Gallifrey, and other local cons...there's no fee at all, because I
can go and come back.  If it's cross country, then yeah, the fee goes up with
distance, because if I'm going to travel that far, I need to make sure that
there are going to be a reasonable number of people there.  So that mitigates
toward cons that can afford a speaker's fee.

And again, I deliberately keep my fees to a fraction of what is generally
required by cast members for the very reason that it puts me in reach of
smaller conventions.  I do this as an act of respect toward the fan run cons
across the country and elsewhere...so I take your comments here as a personal
slap in the face.

I never, ever, at any time said that a given fee somehow legitimizes a
convention.  It's a stupid thing to say, and I never said it, never implied it.
 

Please refrain from attributing to me things I never said.  I have a hard
enough time handling what I DO say to worry about all the ones I didn't say.

I agree, I'm pretty pleased with how this set came out.  Some of the images are

with screen grabs, but the set looks very nice.  Though that one picture about
turning out the lights from SiL will doubtless just drive down the price of the

It's the latter, though we've been composing more for widescreen and actually

1) For those who haven't heard, there are new Sifl and Ollie installments now
airing on MTV at 8:00 p.m. East and West Coast times.  If you thought sock
puppets couldn't have their own talk show, well, you're just wrong, that's all.
 It's a wonderful, funny, utterly demented program.  Give it a shot.

2) Stephen Furst asked me to mention that a huge portion of the B5 cast who
attended VorCon here were stiffed for the bulk of their fees.  Michael O'Hare,
Peter Jurasik, Mira, Bill, Pat, Jeffrey and others were never paid what they
were promised.

That the cast nonetheless came out and peformed and did their all for the fans
in spite of this says a lot for them, I think.

Subject: Re: Evan Chen Not on CRUSADE yet!!!!!!

If I thought Evan Chen was an error, whether I chose to admit it or not, I
would not have him on as composer on the series.

But it was not an error, as testified by the many folks who've come out of the
woodwork (many of them musicians) to say that they loved the music on ACTA. 
Your opinion is your opinion, and that's fine...but there are other opinions
just as valid.  So don't use your opinion as proof that an error of fact has
taken place, and thus that I'm not admitting it somehow being indicative that
I've changed.

And Evan *is* doing the music on the series.  We've scored three so far, and he
continues to improve with every episode, as Chris Franke improved with every
episode.  WB thinks he's a genuine find.

We will soon be putting up the main title for CRUSADE on thestation.com, and
you can see some more of what he's doing musically, and I have to say it's
great.

I have no intention of making a change in composers for CRUSADE.

Subject: Re: ATTN: JMS, was Re: Ramming Speed

Since this debate began, I've heard from any number of people...and any number
of military types who actually would be in a position to either hear this, or
say this.

And it's totally a reasonable line.  Some, including former commanders on
shipboard and ordinary sailer-types  noted that there are two Really Worrisome
Orders: the first is "Emergency speed," which means "kill warning bells,
disable safety systems, give her everything she's got and let me know just
beore the engines burn out."

The other is...ramming speed.  Which means "kill warning bells, disable safety
systems, full emergency speed, today is a good day to die."

The basic delineation is that when you're in battle, you use the bare miminum
of words to express what you're trying to say, because seconds can mean the
difference between life and death and success and failure.

One could, indeed, make the longer, more involved statements others have said
they'd've preferred...but by that time, there would be no surviving ship to
give the order to.  Further, you want to give the crew the minimum possible
time to think about what these orders *mean*...so you keep it short and sharp
and rely on their training to get them to do what the order implies.

Yes, it's an old-fashioned term...but there's such a thing as tradition in
military language, where ships have decks even though they're not wooden decks
anymore...and there isn't a naval officer anywhere who on leaving port doesn't
say "set sail," even though he could be commanding a nuclear vessel without a
sail in sight.

This is true only if you do continue to maintain thrust without ever turning
off your engines.  Which means you would burn out your engines, or run out of
fuel.  

This is a pedantic point.  Maximum speed would refer to what this given
starship can do in regular operations, with finite fuel and common-sense
applied to how long and how hard you burn the engines.  A Starfury knows what
its maximum speed is if it ever hopes to return home; it's the OPERATING system
we're talking about, not the greater laws of physics in the universe.  A pilot
just needs to know "How fast can I push this puppy?"  Yeah, a jet fighter can
exceed specs...and he'll black out, burn out, and crash.

This is a case of not seeing forest for the trees.
