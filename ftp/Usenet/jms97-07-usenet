"OK, who's studios will it be filmed at? That's ashitload of equipment to
move. Will WB rent thier stuff out (not likley) Does TNT have studios in
the LA area equiped for this??"

We never shot on the WB lot.  We have our own off-lot facilities, which
will be the same for future episodes.

"I hope you got more than 6% of the CDs I've bought."

Don't get a penny of those...those are soundtracks and not included in the
merchandise area (don't ask why, I barely understand it myself).  Ditto
with videotapes.

Bruce had some time between episodes, and began to grow the beard for
real, and we darkened it down for later acts.

Geez!  Calm down a bit!  The check disk is being circulated through
Babylonian Productions even as we speak for fact checking and
operational stability.  We are working on a deal for distribution, and
will let everyone know when the deal is done.  Shouldn't be long now,
but in this group quoting a date or even a time frame is VERY
dangerous.  :-)
