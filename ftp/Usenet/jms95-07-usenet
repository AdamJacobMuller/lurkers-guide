     Uh-oh.
 
     When I saw faq in your inquiry to me, insofar as I knew, we were just
discussing a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) file, the same as we've seen
many times before.  I did NOT know that it was essentially a note saying
that mass reproduction services were being offered for episodes.
 
     Whether money is charged or not is not the issue; if someone is making
group copies of episodes for others, that is an infringement of copyright,
and *believe me*, Warners will come down hard on anyone doing this.
It's common practice to make 1-2 copies of something for an archive, or
for a friend, but to make multiples like this and supply them in htis
(this) fashion is going to put you in deep legal shit with the suits at
WB, *trust* me on this.
 
     I would strongly urge you to reconsider.  Your heart is in the right
place, as far as enthusiasm for the show goes, but to do this on the
scale you are suggesting breaks not only US and UK laws individually, but
collectively as well, and you could end up in serious trouble.

     I read both.  The Ivanova/Talia thing wasn't handled exactly as I
had thought it would, and missed some parts of it (it was very late that
night), and by the time I caught some of it, it was too late.  The comics
version shows creatures that are not the shadows themselves but some of
the many creatures who serve them.  I try to catch all I can.  I sent the
third book back for a *total* rewrite which put it behind a couple of
months, but that's okay by me.  Better right than on time.

     Nope.  The CBG info is old.  I was just told yesterday that the
contract for the B5 comic has been extended through 24 issues total, not
the 11 noted in the article, which gives us a year and a half or so to
build the audience further for the book.  It's doing well, and having only
been out for six issues, needs a fair shot at finding its audience.

Subject: Lestat gives up (Victory for t

     Lestat, nothing is served by public displays of self-pity.  On the
electronic screen, it simply comes off as indulgent and "poor me,"
whether that is the intent or not.
 
     You say you have been judged by others, and you think unfairly so.
I have pointed out, as have others, that if you make mass copies of this
show, for distribution to others, *free or otherwise*, it's illegal, and
you will get nailed by Warner Bros.  This is not judgment, it's a fact.
 
     It's like saying, "I'm going to take this book from this store and
not pay for it," and everyone says, "But that's shoplifting," and you
come back with anger because you're being judged.  No, those are the laws,
and it doesn't matter if you intended to simply give it to someone else
without cost to yourself.
 
     Spending months mass-copying B5 episodes from the UK to the US is
patently illegal; you not only violate US and UK copyright laws
individuallly, but collectively; you would even violate the federal laws
regulating the transport of illegal goods via interstate mail.  You could
be *hurt*, and badly.  And believe me, if WB found out about it, you
WOULD be, for doing this on the scale you describe.
 
     We've recently run into someone who was selling unlicensed B5 tapes
here in the US.  Mass produced.  This person has been identified, and
evidence gathered, and now this person is going to be prosecuted, and
subpoenad, and spend months in courthouses and giving depositons and
paying fines and potentially doing time, depending on the breaks.  The
only difference is that one does it for money, the other doesn't, but THAT
isn't the core of the problem, it's copyright infringement.
 
     People here, myself included, have gone out of our way to tell you
that what you proposed was illegal, and would get you in massive amounts
of trouble, to *save you from getting hurt*.  You could be standing on a
ledge, about to jump, with people telling you not to do it, and then turn
around and yell at them for interfering in your own business.  Well, it
ain't just your business, and it is for your own good.  If you cannot see
that, it's nobody's fault but your own.

Subject: AAITN Question

     The Streib saw an alliance between Earth and Minbar at that moment,
which is the LAST thing they wanted to go up against.  Also, you don't go
to war at the drop of a hat just because somebody sinks or shoots down
one of your ships.  This is one of the cliches in storytelling.  And what
the Streibs were doing was totally unjustifiable in any event.  Do you
gear up for the massive hassle of total war -- supply lines, fleets, all
the rest -- because of this incident?  Remember, the purpose of the ship
was to find races weak enough for them to attack with impunity; they don't
want to go up against a force that can strike back.

show for grownups, screw the toys.  And we got hammered in the press,
mainly by people who hadn't watched the show.  So one day, I'm watching
SisBert doing their collective thing, a video round-up installment of
their review show...and suddenly they say, look, we don't normally talk
about TV series, but there's this one show you gotta check out, it's got
a dopey name, and forget the toys, but there's something Going On with
this show, it's really got a great story.

first time a year ago, dragged along by Harlan.  Glad I went.

and another guy, the one who ran the booth in the dealer's room) trying
to escape, the two of us holding this guy, struggling to get away, for
the cops, and a con organizer saying to him, "Hey, you've just been
arrested by a celebrity," and the shoplifter's response, "Fuck you"....
the B5 reception, even *with* the MST3Kification of one of my episodes...
the pleasant, friendly, enthusiastic fans who were a joy to meet...it was
an unvarnished terrificness.

the novels go, an outline comes in, on spec, and I work with it to make it
fit in continuity, or at least not contradict anything being done in the

but something always needs to be done.  And done again, as much as can be,
when the actual manuscript comes in.  It's one more thing, but then my

Subject: ATTN JMS: Selling your soul to

     That's a very hard question to answer, if I'm going to try and answer
it totally honestly.  Sitting here now, at this moment, with year 3 a go,
I'd say, "If they said replace Ivanova and Sheridan, I'd refuse, even if
it were a condition of pickup."  That's what I'd like to think I'd say.  I
hope that it's what I *would* say.  At least, at this moment.
 
     But now I try to put myself in that future frame of mind...I have 200
or so people who work for me, who'd be out of jobs.  The story would be
aborted, and the series ultimately a failure because it didn't go to term.
Everything we'd built so carefully these last 2-3 years would be down the
toilet.  We'd have to dismantle the sets, sell old props, vacate the
stage...emotionally, it would be devastating.  Many careers would be hurt.
 
     At that point, it would come down to, Do I hurt 2 people or 200?
 
     So I guess, really, the answer is...I don't know.  I know what I'd
like to do, particularly if I felt strongly that I could get them to back
down.  It's a question of who blinks first.  Fortunately, WB and PTEN are
VERY happy with our cast, feel they're doing great jobs, and we're on the
cusp of breaking through, so I gravely doubt that decision would ever have
to be made.

     The net is like any form of technology; it can be used for good or
ill depending on who's behind the keyboard.
 
     On another level (if I can mix metaphors for a moment), the net is
like a large, and very capricious beast.  If you show the least fear, it
will eat you.  It's very clear that most of the folks at ST are afraid of
the nets, they HATE the nets, because info they don't want out GETS out,
the criticism can be very harsh...it's tough.  In the case of B5, we work
WITH the nets, to the extent that even after showing an episode, giving
people new information, and information = power on the nets, if I ask that
it not be posted publicly until the show airs, in virtually every case
that request has been granted.  Because you know who I am...and I know who
YOU are.  That dialogue doesn't exist with ST.
 
     For those not plugged in, it can be terrifying.  Mira Furlan has
commented, in one on-line message, that the nets can be very cruel.  This
is true.  People forget sometimes that there's a person at the other end
of the keyboard, and especially when critiquing actors, do so in terms so
often cruel and unnecessary and hurtful.  Michael O'Hare recently commented
at Chicago comic con that he was *deeply* hurt by many of the things said
about him on the nets...here in particular.
 
     So it takes a *very* tough skin to stick it out here, lemme tell you.

Fatman when my exec producers got screwed over (if they went, I went);
finally left Murder, She Wrote to do B5.  All but the last were over story
control/story integrity.  My agent is frequently driven to distraction over

     Re: "he writes at close to Asimov's speed."
 
     One thing I miss here, and wish there was more of, was more on the
task of writing.  I think there's a good opportunity here for more on the
technical side of all this...the writing, how the different departemtns
(departments) come together, all the production stuff nobody tells you.
 
     So on the writing speed issue, a little something that may be of
use.
 
     Mark Twain said, "Never write a scene until you have finished it to
your satisfaction."  Meaning in your head.  You should always play the
scene over and over in your head, filling it out further and further each
time, until you can play it like a movie.  Then, when it's all worked
out, you sit down and transcribe it.
 
     This is kinda how I work.  I finish a scene, load up what I need to
do in the next scene...and distract myself, here on the boards, doing
something else, and gradually filling out the scene over and over until
it's crystal clear.  Then when you sit down to write it, it goes quickly.
 
     Also helps to type 120 wpm, but the other helps a *lot*.

early; each time I've done one of these presentations, even though they
keep giving me progressively bigger rooms, they keep filling up.
 
     Couple more merchandising items in the works, looks like they might
be kinda cool.
 
     As noted in a side-topic, and thus probably missed, Dell has signed
to do 5 more B5 novels.
 
     The B5 stage is getting busier every day, as more folks begi
reporting back to work.  The first batch of scripts are being broken down
by the Assistant Directors into shooting schedules, construction is going
bigtime on a couple new sets and a total redesign of another (Medlab), all
continues on-track for day one of shooting on July 31st.
 
     To the best of my knowledge, Michael O'Hare has *still* not been paid
the balance of his fee for appearing at Big Bang, a total of $5,000.  Nor
has there even been any contact from them.  Phone calls remain unreturned.
 
     We hope, in a few weeks, to be announcing, finally, an official
Babylon 5 Fan Club, which will offer some items not available anywhere
else.  (Some of them will be made by the same people who make the real
props themselves, thus guaranteeing 100% authenticity to what'd done in
the show.)  (Make that *what's*.)
 
     We hope that, within a year or so of the fan club getting going, to
put together a *proper* B5 convention, with not only the actors, but
people from every department, giving them the chance to show what they
do, and how, and allow a chance to interact with viewers.
 
     Lately, from published figures, B5's overnights have been above those
of Voyager (3.4 compared to 2.7 or thereabouts).  Much to the surprise of
people at PTEN, B5 episodes which have now aired multiple times are still
doing very well.  This is very unusual in reruns.
 
     There *may* be some movement on the videocassette issue.  More on this
as it develops.
 
     Finally, expect a big online presence/push for the October/November
period, possibly with a B5 web page and other new on-line resources
(multimedia and the like) provided by PTEN.
 
     My sense is that right now, we're *just* about where X-Files was just
before it broke through.  I think we'll finally break through that glass
ceiling in our third season.

Subject: ATTN: JMS Why all the dreams?

     Dreams function on many levels.  Some cultures use them as a kind of
second, or parallel reality.  They make good literary devices.  Also,
there's a fair amount of thematic undercurrent about free will vs.
predestination, and one of the ways to tap into that is to use dreams as
subtext and metaphor.
 
     My own dreams are not particularly noteworthy, except in one respect:
about 90% of them take place in the same place.  See, I always moved around
when I was a kid, spending as little as 6 months, sometimes a full year,
moving with my family from town to city to state from one end of the
country to the other.  (Don't ask.)  So I think in large measure to counter
that sense of rootlessness, my brain kinda created this "home town" and
that's where I spend much of my dreamtime.  I know the layout of the
place, where the stores are, my favorite comics/magazine shop, the same
house (in which the renovations are *finally* finished to the second
floor, I'm happy to say, and now they've gone on to doing some landscaping
and suchlike outside), there are even a couple of theaters in which I see
movies I *almost* remember the next morning.  (I actually wrote down one
of them in some detail, a Star Trek movie, belive it or not; did the
whole outline beat for beat from the dream.  Not bad.  Not good, but not
bad.)  We had a third theater in town, but it got cobbled into a mini-mall
and it's just too much of a mess.
 
     And *nothing* extraordinary happens there.  It's pretty much just a
mirror for what I do in my waking hours.  Story problems I'm working on
during the day, I'm working on "over there" at night, just in a different
mental place.
 
     Back to the show...I have, at times, used early dream images.  The
shot of Londo looking up to seeing huge ships passing overhead in "The
Coming of Shadows" is a direct dream-steal from years ago.

     I have nothing but good things to say about Angela Lansbury.  She is
probably one of the classiest performers I've worked with, fiercely loyal,
takes responsibility, wonderfully talented...I think she knew that I was
flattered and impressed to be working with her, and I kinda suspect she
thought it was kinda cute, in a dopey kind of way.
 
     Our offices were not far from the shooting stages on the Universal
lot, and most of the time I was stuck behind the keyboard.  But when it
was one of my scripts on the floor, I'd try to get out there once or
twice, just for a few moments.  I'd slip in, watch for a little bit, and
then vanish again...and one day Angela came out and pulled me in, saying
that she was intrigued by the way I'd just materialize and vanish again,
that it was like some magical white horse appearing out of nowhere, and
then vanishing.  She and her husband Peter were both very kind to me.
 
     They even put my novel, OtherSyde, on the bookshelf in the set of
her New York apartment; it can be seen occasionally in some shots.

     That was kinda the problem; Sinclair didn't really *have* a direct

that on top of his direct, personal connection to so much else of the B5
storyline.  I figured he'd get into it by virtue of his involvement with
so many others touched by it; problem is, very soon that turns you into
an expositional sounding-board or a problem-solver, with the other person
at the core of the story.  It's one of those things you don't really see
until you're well into the writing of the story, as with any novel.

4x CD Rom, 17" monitor (Nanao vs. Supermatch), 28.8 modem, Imagine 128

     We have an Audio Spotting Session.  At this, I sit down with John

the beginning and endings of sections where I want music.  E.g, "Okay,
in at 03:23:15 (three minutes, 23 seconds, 15 frames), out at 04:15:23."
Sometimes I will have specific ideas on the kind of music ("I think we
need to go soft here, mainly strings, some brass, but *light*"), other
times I just leave it to Chris to get what the sense of the scene is.  If
there is a big EFX sequence going on at the same time, as in a battle
scene, the sound design people (also in the meeting) and I go over the
scene with Chris, and decide which elements will be carried by sound, and
which by music, making sure each carves out sufficient space in either the
high-end or the low-end to accommodate the other.

     About, oh, a year ago, I went in for my usual checkup, and my doctor
took a chest x-ray (I was kinda stressed, and he wanted to take a look).
So the x-ray comes in, and he says, "You have a shadow across your
heart."
 
     "What the hell does THAT mean?" I asked.
 
     "I don't know," he said, "I've never seen anything quite like it.  I
can't tell if it's an enlarged vessel casting a shadow, or some unusual
muscle tissue, or what.  So I took it downstairs to a cardiologist and
asked for his opinion."
 
     "So what'd he say?"
 
     "He said, "The guy's got a shadow across his heart."
 
     There've been several x-rays since, no change, nothing ominous,
except they can't quite figure it out.

Subject: ATTN: JMS  What's it like befo

     It's really kind of hard to explain; it's a mix of many things, some
tension (everything has to be ready to go on July 31st, no delays, no
revisions, no backsies); it's a bit like going back to school after a long
summer break (less so for me, since my "summer break" is filled with
the summer school of writing scripts)....
 
     A dead stage is a dark, depressing thing.  No actors, no sound, just
H8xX[Jedifices standing and waiting for someone to give them life.  Now, slowly,
you have carpenters appearing, set dressers appearing, lighting crews
appearing, and there's sound, hammers banging and cranes lifting and drills
whirring...people walking from set to set discussing revisions,
improvements...the previously empty halls are populated by runners, PAs,
directors, staff, crew...it's like this huge engine slowly beginning to
turn, and every day you hear the turbine whine growing just a little
louder until you know the sucker's about ready to take off.
 
     So there's a LOT to do; but overall it's a very good time.  As of
now, five scripts have been published in-house and in WB, and everyone is
nuts about them; the set improvements are great; the actors are excited,
and everyone's ready to kick butt.  It's cool.

Subject: Re: Why is Ford in rastb5?

     There are any number of simple reasons why Ford is on the nets.
He is here because he is a petty, vicious, vindictive person who takes
personal joy in assaulting his "victims" as he puts it on AOL.  You want
to see the true face of FT?  Go over to the Neutral Zone in the Star Trek
main area on AOL.  He uses that phrase to describe those he disagrees
with.
 
     He's here because he likes the attention, because if he can make you
angry, it somehow validates his existence, makes him feel important, gives
him a sick thrill.  It is the same mentality witnessed in the juvenile
who throws a stink bomb into the girls locker room to watch them scurry
and get mad.
 
     He's here because he's offended by the very notion that the opinion
of ANYone else should be considered in any way more valuable, informed or
popular than his own.  If a question is asked of me, he's upset and stamps
his little foot...why should I be asked for an opinion if HE wasn't?  My
opinion *can't* matter any more than his, the very notion is abhorrent to
him.  He is that sort of creature noted by Kurt Vonnegutt in "Welcome to
the Monkey House," who if he cannot see well, insists that others be
blinkered; if he cannot run quickly, others must be hobbled.  There is
just room enough in Ford's universe for Ford; anything else must be
attacked, dismissed, ridiculed, abused.
 
     He's here because he's a net-stalker after someone with notoriety,
no different than the kind of person who follows around celebrities and
leaves harrassing notes, and when he doesn't like what they say, snarls
and accuses them of one thing or another.  He is here because he's a
bigot, stating that because of someone's job description -- producer or
writer -- that person is, de facto, a liar, untrustworthy.  A socio
economic racist.  If he were to say such things about jews, or african
americans, as a class, he would be instantly seen for what he is, but he
can hide his bigotry behind the notion of accepted cliche.
 
     He's here because he feels he has a *right* to be here, to say
anything he wants, and anybody who says otherwise, who squeaks any kind
of protest, is attacking his freedom, is a kneejerk worshipper of
the object of his hateful obsession...but who has no compunction
against sending faxes of my messages to Warner Bros., as he has done, to
try and force them to force me off the nets and shut off MY opinion.
Because the universe should rightly favor the opinion of Ford and nobody
else.
 
     He's here because he can enjoy the privilege of striking from
the shadows, of making statements without the least factual proof behind
them, vanishing when convenient and lashing out when convenient, all from
the warm recesses of blessed anonymity, because nobody here monitors his
activities, his words, his job, his off-line truthfulness.
 
     He makes pretense of being open-minded and fair...but again, those
on AOL, just go check out the messages referenced above to see his true
face.  He posts ratings when they show B5 not in the top 20, because
it's rerun time, and carefully omits noting that B5's overnights are now
higher than Voyager's (1.7 from Voyager to 2.9 for B5, both in reruns),
because he has staked his opinion on the often-repeated assertion that
ratings = quality, and the universe of Ford cannot allow, cannout
countenance, the notion that B5 might be rating higher than Voyager.
Hence the telling omission.
 
     He does not sow, neither does he reap.  He exists here only to be
difficult, to insult, to enrage, to inflame and excorciate and belittle
because it makes him feel like a big man, makes him feel like he's done
something with his life...he *enjoys* it when the folks here get mad.  He
gets off on it.  The worst thing you can do is get upset because that's
what he likes.  You're doing *exactly* what he wants you to do.
 
    The only thing to do with him is to simply ignore him, and do not
respond directly.  I do not read his messages, I only sometimes run into
bounce-backs in a quoted message from somebody else.  Because he is, in
the end, a sad and pitiable figure, our resident Gollum who bites and
snaps because he can do no other, because he sees in the world at large
only a reflection of himself...it fills his world, and reinforces what he
believes the world to be.
 
     If I were to ask *anything* of this group, and I've rarely asked
much of anything...it'd be to simply ignore him.  Don't respond, because
no matter what you say, however logical or reasoned your argument, it
will be twisted and turned and distorted, returned with insult and
derision, regardless of your statement's merit.  If you know that going
in, then it becomes clear that there's no point, really, in writing or
saying anything to him, because you know what the response will be
even before you write it.  Just leave him  be.  If he consistently fails
to find the sustence his obsession demands, he will soon enough leave to
lick his wounds elsewhere, and complain about the mean people who
refused out of spite to validate his existence and his opinions by virtue
of response.  He is that kind of person who must verify his existence by
the echo produced by his shoutings.  Do not be that echo.
 
     (And perhaps this should be reposted when next he comes round, if
anyone cares to archive it; I frankly can think of nothing else to say
to or about him or his ilk.  If I say anything, it's "Why should HIS
opinion matter?"  If someone else says anything, it's "Why are you talking
on his behalf?"  No win.  So maybe keeping this around, and pointing to
his more obvious tricks, will help keep this a tidier and more pleasant
place to hang out.)
 
                                                                 jms

     Three Emmy nominations is great, from where we sit; we got one on

now three on the second season...and there are several vital categories
we haven't heard from yet, which won't be decided for another couple or
three weeks: directing, sound editing, music and visual EFX, and we have
hopes of nailing at least one more in that group.
 
     It's sobering when you stop to realize that of all the shows on
network and syndication, only *eleven* dramatic series were chosen for
nomination in various categories...with B5 earning as many nomations, or
in some cases more than, Lois And Clark, Murphy Brown, Murder She Wrote,
The Tonight Show, DS9 (with 2), the Simpsons and many others.
 
     Actors *always* get overlooked in genre shows, that's unfortunately
the nature of the beast.  So that aside, we're nothing but pleased.

Subject: ATTN JMS:  Full or part time o

     It really depends on the breaks.  Sometimes a regular cast member
can be there every day; sometimes they get a day or two off here and there
within the course of an episode.
 
     Guest actors are booked by days needed, or if it's a major part, then
a full-week deal is made.
 
     What most folks probably don't know is that when you shoot an episode
you first begin by doing a production board, and what scenes are shot in
which order is determined by *where the scenes take place.*
 
     For instance: we have 3 stages.  So in the morning, we'll shoot all
the scenes that take place in medlab.  If that takes all day, then that's
how long we're there.  Once we finish, if it's say around lunchtime, we'll
generally try and stay in the same stage to minimize the hassles of going
from stage A to C, because then you've got to re-rig and set up and that
kills time.  Sometimes you'll change stages if you've got Actor B only for
3 days under contract, and you have to adjust.
 
     We take it as a matter of pride that in 44 episodes, we've had only
about 8 days of overtime on a shoot, and never once have we done a forced
call on an actor.

Subject: JMS: The Child is Father to Th

     I've just written...oh...about 20 messages in the last hour, from
questions here...none of them stopped me.  This one did.  I guess I
didn't see it coming.  Some personal stuff I don't generally get into on
the nets.  I'll sometimes talk about it at conventions, but I try not to
drag it in here.  But since it's come up, I guess I can handle the
answer.
 
     No, I didn't have a particularly great upbringing.  I grew up within
an abusive, alcoholic, wife-beating environment.  We moved every six
months or every year, trying to stay one step ahead of creditors, used the
last name "Stark" when Straczynski was too "hot."  I really didn't
understand the situation much; I figured every family was like this.  I
didn't begin to really get a sense of how crummy it was until I began to
see how other families *did* have normal lives.
 
     My feeling about it overall is...don't whine or whinge about it,
deal with it and move on.  Too many people use crummy childhoods to
explain away crummy behavior in the present.  That doesn't wash with me.
Does that "emotional baggage" still "haunt" me, to use your terms?  No,
not really.  Am I still pissed about some of it?  Hell yes.  Why not?
 
     There's a line in a Billy Joel song..."You still have a rage inside
you / That you carry with a certain pride / It's the only part / Of a
broken heart / You could ever save."  That's kinda it, but not quite so
maudlin or self-indulgent.  Anybody who had a perfect, blemish-free
youth and adolescence raise your hand....
 
     That's what I figured.  So we deal with it.
 
     (Great joke...when Jesus intervened in the stoning of a woman and
said, "Let you who are without sin cast the first stone," and suddenly a
rock comes flying into frame, and he says, "Mommmmmmmm!")
 
     I do tend to use some of it in my work, because it grounds me in
reality, and the reality of *the scene*.  I used a lot of it in an
episode I wrote for TWILIGHT ZONE, "Acts of Terror," about a wife
beater...which ended up being used (and is still used) at some shelters
for battered women in counseling centers, about how to find your own
power and authority.  But that's what a writer does; I've used bits and
pieces of my life all over the show, including the scene between Sinclair
and Catherine Sakai when they get back together for the first time, which
is almost verbatim from stuff I've gone through.
 
     If there's anything that has stayed with me, it's manifested itself
in a fierce loyalty to friends, because when you move every 6-12 months,
you don't get much chance to find them.  I grew up in the streets of Newark
and less terrific places, and you learn a little something about sticking
together when you grow up in the streets.  Anytime somebody wants to take
on a friend, they have to go through me first.  Hurt me and I'll hurt you
back in equal proportion; hurt a *friend* and I'll tear your fucking head
off.  And then I'll get nasty.
 
     Is that a particularly salutory trait?  No, not really.  It sounds
good on paper, but it puts me into constant trouble.  I've tried to
moderate that a little...but how do you moderate loyalty?  When the phone
rings at 3 a.m. and it's someone you know in pain or in trouble or in
jail...how do you quantify and decide *this* time you'll go but *next*
time you won't?
 
     So yeah, I've had a tough ride.  I sacrificed a lot to get here; I
have zero social life, except for my pal Harlan.  I haven't been to a
party in something like two years; don't get out to see movies but maybe
4-6 times a year; when I was breaking in, I had to choose often between
food and writing supplies...and always chose the latter, and if you look
in one of the back issues of WD, you'll see a picture of me from taht
period, at 6'5" weighing about 150-160 pounds.  But that was my *choice*.
We all gotta do what we gotta do; I decided that I'd either make it as a
writer, or I wouldn't make it at *all*.
 
     Because sometimes, kiddo, that's what it takes.
 
     But with all of that...the present-tense reality is that I'm pretty
reasonably content.  I'm doing the only thing in the world I'm the least
goddamned good at, and people are actually *paying* me to do that which
I'd have to do for free otherwise, because I can do no other.  I have a
nice house, and I work on a show I enjoy, I write what I want...so I'm not
angry all the time, as I was once before.  Most days I figure that's a
good thing; other times, I worry if it's taken the edge off the work.  But
in the interim consideration...I'm content.
 
     As for pursuing a Psychology degree...wasn't out of any particular
desire to understand myself.  Hell, at that time, I hardly even wanted to
associate with myself, much less understand myself.  No, I just went in
with the assumption that you should never major in writing if you really
want to BE a writer...learn other stuff, read other books, see other kinds
of lives...become a generalist, so you can apply a little bit of everything
to the work.  That seemed most conducive to being a generalist.
 
     Until Skinner came along and suddenly math was involved.
 
     But that's another story for another time....

Subject: JMS, JV, et al.: Writing

     The two keys in creating characters for TV are: allies and enemies,
you create people who you know will come into conflict with one another,
because conflict is a huge part of drama, not the whole of it, but a
necessary ingredient.  So you also build some who can be sympathetic, or
funny by turns, but you don't want to minimize or throw away a character,
you add a layer of depth to it to give meat to the humor when used.
 
      It's kind of like planning a military campaign, really.
 
     The world and the characters of B5 kind of came together at the
same time, one feeding off another until they took on a life of their
own.  And building both was a joy.

     The tracking of people, notifying and confirming hirings is the job

(any) problem, they have plenty of time to adjust.  Usually there are
lots of folks in that department who can give recommendations, and there
is quite a list of folks who want to work with us.

     Chris: the point you make is exactly right.  The music for each
season is designed to reflect the progression of that season; some feel
they don't like season two as much as one, because it doesn't summon up
the same feelings.  But that's the intent; it's not supposed to summon
up the same emotions.  It's kind of the equivilant of creating a
different cover for every new installment of a series of connected
novels.
 
     What do I have in mind for season three?  What I indicated to Chris
Franke was to look at a piece of music he did in "The Long, Twilight
Struggle" and interpolate some elements of that into the main theme, with
a very hard sound.  The piece in question is about the middle of the
first really...um...busy scene after the act break.

Subject: ATTN: JMS Questions on Ghostbu

     "Ulysses" is probably the most moving of Tennyson's work, for my
money.  It speaks to something profoundly entrenched in the human
spirit.  It's something I try to put in front of people at any
opportunity.
 
     As for Janine...the change bothered the hell out of me, to go from
a strong, smart, fashion-aware (in a weird way), independent woman...to
a mommy-character.  And, in time, they kinda realized that I was right,
and the consultants were wrong...mainly when the mailbags filled with
angry letters from mothers and young girls raising ten kinds of hell.
 
     But by then they didn't have any solution except just change her
without explanation *again*...which is when I chimed in and said, "I
can fix this.  But you've got to let me do this MY way."  They did, and
it was done.
 
     I was somewhat disappointed by Ghostbusters II.  It took an awful
long time to get going, and then just fell back on much of what it had
done in the first movie.  It made the producers nuts when they got
audience responses from lots of people saying that they like the TV
series better than the movie, and that the movie was "just for kids."
 
     One of my favorite moments from that was writing an episode called
"Take Two," in which Hollywood producers come to the guys and say they
want to make a movie about the team...so they go to LA, have a little
adventure...and the episode ends with actual footage from the first
movie...with the result that millions of kids were convinced, totally
conVINced, that the series *preceded* the first movie.
 
     It was one of the more wonderfully sick things I've done.

     Yes, you're correct, the alignments in B5 vary depending on whose
agenda is in force at that moment; and they change with time.  But in
general you always need conflict, especially in TV, and to varying degrees
in other works.  It's the seed from which drama emanates.  When I was on
Murder, She Wrote, you couldn't just have Jessica go to somebody and get
the information easily.  There had to be some conflict involved, there had
to be *work* to pry it loose.  Otherwise it just falls flat.

Subject: Attn JMS: Speaking in Parables

     I think that, by all rights, anybody should be able to "get" each
episode.  The only thing that varies is their degree of..er...getness.
 
     Getnosity?
 
     Whatever.
 
     The stucture is fairly straightforward: the primary story in any
given episode is relatively self-contained and self-explanatory.  You can
see that one episode, and no others, and be able to follow it.  If you
CANNOT do this, then the episode has failed.  The key, as I've noted from
the start, is that the MORE you see, or know, the MORE you can get out of
any episode.
 
     The impact of Talia's situation should be the same whether you saw
the comic or not.  (And, remember, the idea was that the comic would come
out AFTER the remaining year 2 episodes, as a nice little frisson, not as
required data.)
 
     I continue to get email and snail mail from people who are still just
now finding the show...and they watch one episode, and that's fine, then
they watch a couple/three more, and THEN they realize that there's an
overall arc, that this is a bigger story than first appears.  For those
who dig out every last detail, it's hard to imagine following the shw
(show) minus all this...but it's absolutely possible, and happens
consistently.  It's your *perception* that has altered by virtue of now
knowing what more is there.  If you don't know the rest, you can still
enjoy pretty much everything there on its most basic level, as an action
or character story.

Subject: Clearing the air.

     Good heavens, I was virtually unaware of the degree to which this
had escalated.  To add, quietly, my two-cents...when I found one of my
posts had been edited by Jay for spoilers, I inquired of him privately
and indicated that this might not be A Good Thing, since I'd been fairly
careful in my phraseology.  He accepted that, and apologized, and was
quite gracious about it.
 
     For my money, you can't keep spoilers out of here, protected or
unprotected, except by virtue of shared kindness and understanding.  The
whole REASON for my getting a moderated newsfeed, as I now do, was to
PREVENT the need to moderate the newsgroup for content.  It thus seems
to me slightly unproductive that it's now done for spoilers when we took
this step of moderating my feed, and inconveniencing many of the rastB5
Rangers, to avoid moderation.

Subject: JMS: imposed tv sf format?

     Most TV shows in the 60s were one-story episodes.  The medium became
a bit more complex as time went on, and people wanted to learn more about
the characters and the world.  We've done some episodes that didn't have
a B or C story at all; it's whatever the story requires.

Subject: ATTN: jms non-B5 Ques

     My scriptwriting book is not currently in print, though a) it's
still available in many libraries, and b) I hope to have the new edition
turned in shortly.  Yes, it deals with the agent/writer relationship.
And currently we're not looking at specs for B5 due to the fact that the
stories are all pretty much worked out.

     I dunno...one can make the argument, as you do, that because I don't
believe in relgion, or telepathy, and have thus no axe to grind or agenda
to advance, I can do so equitably...but something about that logic sounds
a little too slick and self=contratulatory...so I'll just leave it at...

     I don't think there'll be much problem getting in the door or getting
comic con tickets; but: come early, because the con has 27,000 people or5
more attending, and the lines to buy tickets can be absolutely hideous.
Arrive at *minimum* an hour early (10 a.m. or better).

Subject: How do I submit story ideas?

     We *have* our story ideas for the show.  Five years worth.  Bear in
mind that Star Trek is the exception to the rule of how TV series work;
no other show accepts story ideas from folks out there.
 
     (I'm speaking specifically of non-established writers.  Spec scripts
can sometimes get through on shows, but nobody else really looks for just
story ideas.  On B5, all but 2 freelance scripts have been based on
story ideas I've assigned out.)

Subject: ATTN JMS: Divided Loyalties

     Absolutely *nothing* from prior seasons/episodes has been discarded.
So if that's your concern...don't worry about it.
 
     Nothing was trimmed by C4.  There was a slight matching problem in
the footage, that's all.
 
     In very tense situations, some people feel compelled to somehow break
the tension.  Hence, that sequence.

     The short story I'd done in high school -- god, do you *really* want

again in the present to offer Prince Charles Excalibur...and him not quite
knowing what to do about it, then security was called and...well, it got
quite interesting, particularly since she'd popped up in his bathtub.

     For everyday use, I tend to yank out the Oxford American Dictionary,

writing stuff, then I go to my copy of the Oxgord English Dictionary,
which is sort of the Mount Olympus of dictionaries, both in complexity
and sheer weight.  Other books...Roget's Thesaurus, What's What, and a
shelf load of books on mythology, history, politics and psychology.

     Although there have been many interesting anecdotal studies on

and reliably to exist.  So I'm holding the subject in personal abeyance
until the day when somebody can walk into a research lab at MIT or
elsewhere and get 10 out of 10 cards right *consitently* and *repeatedly*
under strict laboratory conditions.

David Duchovney just got a bump in salary to $100,000 an episode).  And
yes, one may discuss "Twilight" with those across the pond who've seen it
here.
