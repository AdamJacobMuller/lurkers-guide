The Garibaldi/GROPO thing was originally slated in the script for them to go to
bed with each other...it was Jerry who objected loudly enough for that to be
changed in the script.

Then there's Franklin and Number One who jumped into bed very quickly, we have
Garibaldi and Lise in bed in "Between the Darkness and the Light," Franklin and
the singer in downbelow... there are plenty of counter-examples.

Conservative I ain't.

I talked to both actors involved, made sure they were okay with it, and then
scripted it out in very detailed form, and shot with a closed set, just
necessary crew, nobody else.  

(Funny item: in the script, I'm right in the middle of describing the sex
scene, and in the narrative description, I write, without even thinking about
it, "I wonder which is more embarrassing, reading this or writing it?"  It goes

We suggested moving up DotD because the NBA playoffs will hit after #12, and
better to have 3-4 intense episodes in a row, culminating in 12, than to break
up the middle, which would've been okay as a respite if there wasn't going to
be a break, but since there is a break now, I want to slam the last few before
it hits for more impact.

Folks have repeatedly said that in the first season, they weren't aware there
WAS an arc until episode 16, "Signs and Portents."  Then, later, they would
look back and see all the setups going on.

That will be much the same situation here.

Thanks..for all of that.  

And yeah, once this season is over, my presence on the nets will substantially
diminish...but it's been a great experience, for the most part, occasional
nutcases and bozos notwithstanding.  In the last year, I think more could've
been done in this ongoing conversation about educating people on the nature of
making TV, which was one of the reasons for doing this...but in many ways I'm
limited by the quality of the questions asked, and lately it's been more
posting of reactions (good and bad, that isn't meant to be a critical comment)
than questions related to who/how/why/what.

Right now, we're shooting 521...three more weeks total, and the Babylon 5
series is over.  Seems vaguely hard to believe.

Neither.  I see the scene itself, as if watching a movie.  I play it over and
over...initially, it's kind of out of focus, and incomplete, I have some
pieces, not others...the more times I play it back in my head, the more it
gradually comes into focus, and the missing pieces begin ot fill in...until I
see the whole scene, end to end, in perfect focus.  Then I use whatever form
I'm writing in -- a novel or a script -- and write it in that format.

It's generally the same...I use a straightforward approach to the stories:
teaser sets the tone for the episode, hooks the audience, makes you wonder what
the heck's going on.  First act introduces the problem in greater detail; here
and in act two you get the characters dealing with the problem, with a major
problem or complication hitting at the bottom of act 2...act three prepares
your characters to deal with the situation, and act four deals with the
situation, leaving the tag (and sometimes part of the fourth act) to have some
nice character moments.

I think you *have* to question what you believe (or don't believe, or believe
you believe or believe what you don't believe) on a regular basis, the way you
exercise any muscle.  If you leave it unattended, it gets flabby and soft and
intellectually lazy.  The peril of the unexamined life is one of the things
I've often railed about in one place or another...whether or not you come back
to your original position after a lengthy self-examination, the important thing
is that you *do* it from time to time, honestly and straightforwardly, because
you could change your position, or if you don't, at least you now have more
reasons and a better understanding of it, so that you can defend it and talk
about it rationally rather than get angry because you can't articulate why you
believe what you believe.

And I believe that may be one of the longest unbroken sentences I've yet
written....

No, there's now only one stand-alone left in the balance of S5.  And, again,
you've got arc material in the first batch, whether you choose to recognize it
now or not.

Nowhere.  You can't apply math to a creative situation, and in an ongoing

Yes and no and yes....

Someone online did a recent breakdown, and actually the amount of CGI in the
first batch of S5 episodes is slightly higher than S4, and S4 is slightly
higher than S3 at that same point.

But that said...I did keep the first batch just a *bit* on the light side in
order to have room to do the massive amount of rendering on "In the Beginning"
and "Thirdspace," the latter of which has (finally delivered) topped out at 27
minutes of CGI out of 94 minutes, which has got to be some kind of record.

And *that* said...each season we have increased the amount of CGI we've done,
both in the amount and the complexity of the shots, and this season is no
exception.  We're trying some new things, different kinds of CGI...you'll see
some of that in "The Ragged Edge," for instance.  Much more sophisticated
compositing, more difficult to shoot, but more visually interesting.

I recently finished a new short story (almost novelette length), "We Killed
Them In the Ratings," which has just been published in a new collection edited
by Martin Greenberg, Blowout in Little Man Flats, a mystery anthology featuring
a lot of Big Name folks.  It's kind of a fun (if dark) story about a local TV

Yes, some writers hate to pitch, and prefer to leave pages (called, most
creatively "leave behinds"), which also eliminates the need to rely on the
story editor to properly convey your story to the producer.

second BA in Sociology (with a minor in Literature) from San Diego State
University.

Thank you for all of that...and as you say, some fires may be averted, but for
others, there is a point of no return, whatever we might feel about it.

The last rating we got for last  week puts us in the top 15 of all basic cable
shows, and we're the top-rated show on TNT after wrestling.

No, it was something I wanted to do from the git-go, even though it's costly to
redesign the title sequence and music every season.  Each season is one volume
in the overall story, and my theory is that in a trilogy, for instance, you
have a different cover on each book that sets the tone for that particular
volume.  If B5 is such a work, then it should have a similar to each season's
"cover."

Subject: Re: ATTN JMS: Thanks for everything

Thanks, Cheryl...it's been great.

(And yeah, I remember the "Murder She Wrote in Space" thing, lots of folks said
it...didn't bother me.  There's no reason anyone should believe a TeeVee
producer when saying the sorts of things I was saying, until the point could be
proven.)

And yes, you're right...whatever follows, it won't hold the same place, or have
the same impact, as B5.  It'll be its own show, and it'll be exciting, but B5
will always be a special and unique case.  I know this particular confluence of
events will certainly never come my way again...but it doesn't have to.  It did
so once.  And that's all that matters.

Subject: Re: ATTN JMS: Music recommendation

I've got all three of the CDs by Cherry Poppin' Daddies, and I think two of the
three are terrific; the third (earlier) CD is kinda generic, I think they were
still trying to find their sound.

Zoot Suit Daddy is a nifty song, and it's impossible to listen to their current
album and remain sad about anything.  I love that they mix a swing/big band
sound with contemporary (and sometimes raw or edgy) lyrics.  They're just
terrific.

I hope you're right.  I've long classified B5 not as a *moral* show, because I
don't have any morals to give anyone, but rather as an *ethical* show, posing
questions and bringing up issues as honestly as I can, to let the viewers
discuss the implications and come to decisions on their own.  If we have
succeeded in doing that, then I'm happy.

We've done a lot with virtual sets and environments, and will continue to
expand, both as needed for episodes now, and as R&D for future projects. 
There's a nifty virtual environment in "The Ragged Edge," and we plan to do
more.

After any big war, that's the big battle that still awaits...how do we work out
living together?  Do we fall apart, or stay together?  Wars of revolution have
traditionally been followed by civil wars because the new dynamics are changing
and people take a while to adjust.  And this show has always been about
process: before, during and after.

Screen Actors Guild rules specify where you can and can't put credits, and
those rules don't concern themselves with spoilers.

We've been using various establishers as stock from the very first year until
now.  The show would be impossible to do otherwise.

No, it's all on a per-project basis from here on out.

No, for one simple reason.

The Shadows were already on the loose in Season 1, if we recall correctly.  Mr.
Morden was running around, and the Shadows were cleaning Lord Kiro's clock and
restoring the Eye to Londo.

The mission to Z'ha'dum had already taken place, and the shadows were already
on the move...so the scenario you suggest was simply not possible.
