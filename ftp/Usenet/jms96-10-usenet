John Copeland is a producer on the show, a line producer (technical term).
 Problem is, he's only on AOL.  I try to direct people to the right areas
in general terms -- if there's a fan club question, go to Jim Lockett at
jplb5@aol.com, for instance -- but basically, I'm here, and if a question
comes my way, I kinda have to answer it because there's nobody else here
to do it.

Subject: Re: ATTN JMS: Writing With the Subsocscious

"Do you think that you write at both the conscious and subconscious level
simultaneously."

I think any writer has to operate at both levels at the same time.  You
learn to trust your instincts.  There's a certain point when you're "in
the zone," to use a sports phrase, and the logical part of you is
structuring the plot, and the illogical, intuitive part of you is filling
in the corners.  You have to be open to both voices for it to work.

Basically, nobody sees anything until it's in first draft form.  Harlan
functions on an as-needed basis; if I have a question, or if there's an
area which could benefit from his input, I call him in, but for the most
part, the scriptwriting is a one-person affair.  The job of the writer is
to listen to the small voice in the back of his head, and too often too
many voices just get in the way.

I think I pretty much agree with the comments, criticisms inclusive. 
OtherSyde was my second novel, and I was still learning my craft, so it
has some rough edges, though overall I think it works.  

Re: some dangling threads and a hurried sense to the last third...again, I
agree.  The book was about 100 pages over what the publisher decided what
he wanted to put out, and sliced off a lot of threads, and hurried a lot
of the other stuff.  Which is one reason why I haven't let the book be
reprinted since; I'd prefer to go to the longer version...and I'm
embarrassed to say I don't know where the draft is.  (Or the files.)  I
think the longer version worked a lot better.

Subject: Re: Writing policy change (was: Walkabout)

"Was there some incident that we don't know about? It seems to me that
there must have been. "

Nope.  No incident.  The situation with year 3 was that *so much* was
being paid off, and set up, and foreshadowed, and required such intimate
knowledge of where the show was going, and where it'd been, that it made
it nearly impossible to bring in any outside writers.  

There has never been any series in television history where every episode
was utterly beyond criticism.  Some are better, some are worse, some are
average.  There are many Twilight Zones by Rod Serling that are utterly
brilliant.  And some that just fall flat.  That's the nature of the beast.
 Sometimes something will look great on the page, and fall flat on the
stage.  (And sometimes it happens in reverse; you think you've got
something that won't work, and somehow the filmed version just takes off.)
 There's a lot about Walkabout I like; and there's some stuff that just
didn't work out.  You try something different here and there, and
sometimes it works, and sometimes it don't.  TV, or any form of writing,
is the constant process of trial and error.  It's not like one day you
forget how to write, or you're writing bad...you very rarely fall below a
certain facility once you reach it.  

There's not a writer alive who has turned out nothing but terrific stuff. 
Now, one could turn out a lifetime of mediocre stuff, by not trying...but
I think it's better to shoot high, and sometimes fall, knowing that you'll
get something great one out of every five tries, than not try at all and
just do okay.  

"Grey 17" is the same thing, for me.  There are bits in that I like a lot.
 And some parts of it just fell down dreadfully.  That's simply the nature
of the beast.  I thought I'd try something different in the tone of "Grey"
and while most of the writing works (mostly), the production fell down on
a couple of aspects.  It happens.  It doesn't mean anything.  

On the other hand, the following 3, "Rock," "Shadow" and "Z'ha'dum" are
some of the best stuff we've done.  The preliminary P5 survey has
"Z'ha'dum" as the best episode of the entire series to date.  Did I
suddenly learn to write better?  If there were a problem with being tired,
then by all rights you should see a descending order in quality.  But
these last 3 are some of our best work.

The real key here is something I heard someone say a while back about TV:
a flaw, or a flop, or a misstep happens by accident as often as by
inability; but real quality is never an accident.  So the latter is more
indicative of the level of the show than the former, since accidents or
missteps *always* happen.  

"Walkabout," for me, is a good episode with a very few clunky parts; for
me, it's a middle of the road episode.  "Grey" falls a bit short of that,
for me.  But then, I'm very hard on my shows; a lot of folks have liked
"Walkabout" a *lot*.  I didn't much like "Infection," but many did; and
some shows I love dearly, like "Geometry," don't catch on.  It's
subjective.  And where you say the battle falls short, others like it...so
on one level, I'd caution against applying your standard as an objective
one that is somehow more true than another, and thus asking "what's wrong
with *you* that I had this opinion?"  If everyone on the planet shares
that opinion, then you've got something.  Otherwise....

And there are always some people who don't want the character stuff at
all, they want battles...and some for whom the CGI is of secondary
interest to the plot...and those who want arc stories *only*...and those
who like the stand-alones.  Some of it is a function of what you want.

Anyway...point being, and I went around the barn a few times to get there,
no, there's no "incident" and I don't even know what this could refer to. 
Some episodes work better for some people than others.  That will happen
whether you've got 1 person or 50 people writing scripts.  I caught a lot
of *very* negative comments on Peter David's script, which you cite (as
well as many positive ones).  The Brits in particular seem to uniformly
dislike that one.  And in the P5 surveys, the freelance scripts are *all*
in the bottom third of the rankings.  So it's really not a question of
freelancers or no, it's just that TV is variable, as is any kind of
writing.  Not every episode is going to work for you.  Nor should you
expect it to.  I'm very much an X-Files fan...but there are some scripts
that work better for me than others.  Doesn't mean anything other than
that show didn't quite jell for me.  That's the nature of TV.  

I'm sure somebody will cite this as being defensive about it, but honest
and true, I'm not.  I'm just trying to explain it from this end of things.
 My prior exec producer said, "You're doing *real* good if, in a season,
you've got one-third that are pretty good, one-third that are okay, and
one-third you never want to see again the rest of your natural life."  I
think we do a heck of a lot better than that, and that's a heck of an
accomplishment.

Subject: Re: Walkabout question (spoiler for Walkabout)

In "Severed Dreams," the dilemma faced by the Alexander in the teaser is
that if they jump, they'll end up leaving their fighters behind.  A jump
engine rips the area open for that one ship, and closes it again right
behind it.  What sometimes happens, as in "All Alone," is that *as a ship
comes out*, it releases its fighters.  But you can't just follow a ship
into a jump point formed by another ship.  You'd probably get torn apart
when space folded back on you, because the field opening the point is
primarily around the other ship.

Subject: Re: All that Jazz (WAS: Re: Walkabout Science Nit Pick) Spoilers removed

Here's what I think is a bit of cultural short-sightedness.  Everybody
keeps saying, "well, if they had that kind of music, shouldn't it have
been shown to be an oldies bar or something?"

Look at classical music for a moment.  Goes back to Beethoven, Brahms,
Bach and lots of composers whose names don't even begin with B.  And
earlier.  Now, I don't mean to alarm anyone or startle anyone with this
revelation, but classical music is *still being written and performed*
hundreds of years later.  Not old stuff, new stuff, of that school and in
that style.  The orchestral suites in the Star Wars movies are strongly
based on classical compositions...is that "oldies" stuff?  You've got one
of the longest running musical plays running now in London, in "Phantom of
the Opera," a *new* composition (well, mostly, knowing how Webber works).

Jazz and blues kinda formally began in the 1920s and 1930s, but its roots
run back to spirituals and african-american music in the 1800s.  And it
didn't just stop suddenly in the 1930s.  There's still new material being
written in that style now; so should Stevie Ray Vaughn's albums or
performances have been labeled "oldies?"  After all, it's sixty years
later and more.

Certain musical styles will stay with us for a long, long time.  Not
performances based on old stuff, but new material in that vein, for those
forms that have shown themselves to be enduring.  200 years from now, in
addition to other forms, you're still going to have original blues songs,
original classical compositions, original jazz, original compositions in
the style of gregorian chants, on and on and on.

It's odd when people try to apply illogical rules to the future that don't
apply now; no one said, as noted, that a Stevie Ray Vaughn concert should
be billed as an "oldies" event, or an oldies bar...even though it's over
half a century since serious blues started going...it's just silly.

Subject: Re: How does JMS feel about fan fiction?

Bottom line, and real simple:

I've asked that fans *not* write any fan fiction set in the B5 universe
while the show is on the air.  Remember, most ST fanfic began after the
show was over, to keep those characters alive.  We're still around.

Fanfic is a threat to us, in that if someone writes a story, puts it in a
fanzine, and something remotely similar is done in the show, that person
could decide to sue.  It happens; Marion Zimmer Bradley lost an entire
*book* over this, when her publisher refused to put the book out because
of the threat of lawsuit from a fanzine with a similar story.  

When someone posted a basic story idea similar to what was planned for
"Passing Through Gethsemane," that script went into cold storage for over
a year; only when the fan involved offered (greatly chagrined) to write
and sign a legal release, and delivered it to me, could that story be put
back into prep.  If he had not been this kind, THAT EPISODE WOULD NEVER
HAVE BEEN MADE.  Roll that one around for a while.

It seems to me that if someone wants to write B5 fanfic, it's because that
fan likes the show, appreciates what's done, and respects those who
created it.  And that selfsame fan would not want to jeapordize the
continued existence of that show.  And would, therefore, honor this
request from those who make it for the duration of the show.

The script which, I hope, WB has included, for "The Coming of Shadows," is

Murder, She Wrote or any other series.  And there's really no one way to
do this, which is something I make clear in the book...you find the style

Subject: Re: ATTN JMS AND ALL: Interesting article in Chicago Tribune

Re: places where B5 isn't mentioned and should be...here's another, which
came out this week, and it's hit that point now where I just have to
laugh....

The current issue of Cinefantastique has a whole two or three page article
about how Voyager is now using story arcs across episodes.  They consider
it a new kind of storytelling for them, but cite the notion that it *has*
been used here and there.  The magazine (not the folks at the show)
enumerate such examples as Hill Street Blues, NYPD Blue, LA Law...of which
2 out of 3 shows are no longer on the air...but what's the one they
*don't* mention?  The only one really doing this in SF until lately?

Yup.  I think the magazine deliberately pre-censored themselves on this,
because they suspect that the folks at Paramount grind their gears bigtime
if B5 is EVER mentioned as in any way having an influence on their shows. 


Here's JMS's rule of journalism, which you'll see repeated in 90% of the
articles on SF out there: if it's an article on B5, ST is almost always
mentioned somewhere; if it's an article on ST, you almost *never* see B5
mentioned.

Subject: jms scriptwriting book info

(This is the last time I'll be forwarding this info for a while; I got
requests from several nets for more info, since the prior notice was
fairly brief, and now that I have a minute to spare, I'm passing it along,
but I don't want to monopolize this overmuch with what is, in essence, a
commercial....)

As I mentioned in my earlier note, bundled with the Tampa convention info,
the new edition of my book, "The Complete Book of Scriptwriting," has just
come out from Writer's Digest Books.  

It has chapters on breaking in as a writer for film, TV, stage and radio,
which have been rewritten stem to stern from the prior edition, fully
updated, old info trashed, again completely revised...plus new chapters on
animation, the Writer's Guild, Warning Signs, altogether about 100,000 new
words.  (The book is huge, 424 pages, one stop shopping for the
script-inclined.)  It's basically the book I wish someone had written when
*I* was starting out in the biz.

It also contains the *complete* script for the Hugo-award winning B5
episode, "The Coming of Shadows," with material deleted from the actual
episode for time.

You can order the book via your local bookstore (ISBN# 0-89879-512-5), or
via www.amazon.com, or direct from WD (800-289-0963).  It sells for $21.99
in hardback.  

It took me about 3+ years to finish the rewrite on this, because I wanted
it to be right.  Now it is.

Subject: Re: "ATTN JMS:A ratings question"

No, nothing new, and I'm really kinda bugged about it.  Because of the
TNT/WB merger, most of our people over at WB who used to give us the
ratings aren't there anymore or have been shifted over to other
divisions...they don't like taking the time to give each individual show
they work on the ratings breakdown because it takes up too much of their
time.  

The only figure I've heard so far was the overall national (final) rating
on the first new episode, which was a 3.2, which is great for coming back.
 The station by station figures I've seen for the second week are higher,
so the overall should be higher, but until they see fit to tell me, I can
only guess, and the trades don't usually publish comprehensive lists.

We're limited to what WB has in stock; WB only sends a photographer to the

there are action sequences.  So very often, guest stars don't get shot. 
The Fleer folks have to make do with what WB chooses to shoot.

Yes, I do remember.  But for starters, we're talking about more than two
weeks of story time.  Between Grey 17 and Rock was several weeks, then
you've got about 2 weeks from Rock to Shadow Dancing.  That's five weeks,

Subject: Re: ATTN JMS: Anti-male joke ruined my enjoyment of Shadow Dancing (*SPOILERS*)

"I gritted my teeth tighter when the dialogue launched into some anti-male
paranoia about "What if the male demands the female stay a second night?",
and the various "vengeances" she could take for a custom that is, after
all, steeply in her favor. I could accept all that in an anthropological
sense: "Look what anti-male customs the Minbari have. Isn't that
fascinating, if you put the moral judgements aside?". But then... Yeesh!"

The "vengeances" she cites, should the male insist she stay another night,
are "she can leave once he falls asleep, complain to the elders, even cut
off his access to her family."  These hardly sound like anti-male
rhetoric, but rather precautions taken to deal reasonably *should* someone
get out of line.  It doesn't state that all men do this, but sets in place
what to do should *some* men do this.

This is not a problem of context.  It is a problem of perception.  It has
nothing to do with the scene, and everything to do with how you perceive
the role of males in society.

"I'm the SF Marathon Director for the MIT Lecture Series Committee, and

favorite SF movies of all time?"

For starters, I'd include "Seconds" on your list, the only marginally SF
film done by Rock Hudson which to this *day* scares the hell out of me. 
John Frankenheimer was never better.

I'd also include "Fail Safe," "Dr. Strangelove," "Seven Days in May" and
"The Manchurian Candidate" which (for my money) do have some SF aspects to
them...if "Alas, Babylon" is SF, then "Fail Safe" and the others can be
included in that.  It's also a grouping that gives newer audiences a sense
of where this country was at a very precarious point in its history.

Of films more definitely in the SF area...Forbidden Planet, The Day the
Earth Stood Still, Something Wicked This Way Comes, Invasion of the Body
Snatchers, The Rocky Horror Picture Show (stop staring at me like that,
it's got aliens and...and space ships...and...and mad scientists and stuff
like that, and it's got a beat and you can dance to it), Aliens, High
Plains Drifter (fantasy), Terminator 2, The Road Warrior, The Princess
Bride (fantasy), On the Beach, Night of the Living Dead, Brazil, Alien,
The Haunting of Hill House, Blade Runner, First Men in the Moon, When
Worlds Collide, Village of the Damned, Earth Vs. the Flying Saucers,
Phantom of the Paradise and Day of the Triffids.

Subject: Re: ATTN JMS: Election Day			(bryoung2@vt.edu (Brian De Young))

Not that it does or should matter...voting is an individual act and how
one person votes should not have influence or bearing on anyone else...but
I plan to vote for Clinton.  For my money, Dole has shown himself to be a
mean, venal little man who thinks that he should get the job because he
earned it in the Senate.  He doesn't have any real plans for it, he just
wants the pointy hat; he thinks he deserves it.  Feeling you're next in
line for promotion, for me, isn't sufficient reason to be given the
mandate to run the country.

The only thing he's ever put on the table was the 15% tax cut, which
strikes me as nothing more than a bribe.  

Frankly, my gut -- which has almost always proven correct around election
year -- tells me that Dole is gonna get whomped *badly* come November.  It
may be the most punishing loss a republican has taken in years.

Which, I suspect, will not be a surprise to the republicans.  I think they
figured, on some level, that Clinton would probably be re-elected -- very
few sitting presidents have been booted out of office while running for a
second term -- and they decided to hold off on their big guns until the
2000 election, rather than fritter them away in 96.  "Dole wants the
nomination so bad, let him have it and get pasted; we'll be over in the
bar, wake us when it's over."

In 2000 you're going to have Gore running hard on the democratic side,
again with an "I deserve it" attitude, though Veeps have traditionally not
done that terribly well when going for the Big Chair.  He'll likely get it
unless someone comes charging out of the corner with a dynamic program and
personality, which is, of course, always a possibility, though he'll have
the democratic establishment on his side.

On the republican side, you're going to see Kemp and Pete Wilson
scrabbling for the nomination for certain; who else, we'll see.  (Don't
laugh re: Wilson.  Lemme tell you a story I heard back when I was a
reporter in San Diego, at a time when Wilson was just mayor.  And an
unpopular mayor at that.  One day one of the other reporters came into a
restaurant we used to hang out at, and he was...well, he wasn't plastered,
but he'd been knocking them back.  Very quiet.  Finally, we got him to
talk.  He said, and this is pretty much verbatim, "Wilson met with the
kingmakers today," he said.  "They're going to run him for senator, then
they're going to run him for governor, and they're going to run him for
president."  This was the most absurd thing we'd ever heard, and said
so...again, he was barely holding on for *mayor*; prevailing logic was
that he'd be lucky to be elected dogcatcher next time around.  He shook
his head.  "They'll run him for senator, then governor, then president." 
And after they ran Wilson (and won) for senator, then governor, and
started poking him out the door for president (stopped only when his
throat went out)...I stopped laughing.)
