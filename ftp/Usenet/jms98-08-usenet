Subject: Re: Attn:JMS.... A GET WELL SOON message

Thanks...no, I'm still writing, even with the heavy antibiotic medications. 
I'm still going into the office, but on half-day basis, which is about all I
can handle right now (and probably more than I should).  The danger with this
kind of pnumonia is that it can feel like it's getting better, and you push
it...and then it nails your ass to the wall.  (That's what nailed Jim Henson,
who had the same basic kind I have.)

Subject: Re: B5 on laserdisc

I spoke to the folks at Image just before leaving for the UK.  They had been
told, repeatedly, by WB that there *were* no widescreen versions of B5
available.

Well, after hearing this, I gave 'em the names of the folks in the WB high-tech
division who've been conforming the widescreen negatives, and the odds are good
that they're going to do this.

Subject: Re: How's Joe's health?

I'm getting better.  The pneumonia definitely knocked me for a serious 3-4 week
loop.  I'm past nearly all of it now, just a bit weak at times from it all.  At
the Wrap Party, I had to go up and rest between panels and presentations, and
at same wasn't quite as energetic as I'm used to being. 

But it's all pretty much over now...and I got to shed 12 pounds I wanted to
lose in any event (didn't want to do that in 7 days, but there you are).

Only one thing works, and that's to pretend the stuff was written by somebody
else, so you can take a fairly objective look at it and cut whatever's dross.

Subject: Re: ATTN JMS: Psi Corp pins made by 'Filmwelt,' Berlin, Germany

The german pins are licensed; I approved the final designs, and hadn't noticed
that the Psi symbol was unstandard; we've used some variations in the show as
well.

Subject: Re: ATTN JMS:  Thanks again for setting the example

Thanks, and good luck in dealing with folks like this, in this way.  It's
tough, I know.

Thanks again.

In most ways, I think Kathryn does fit that description.

Subject: Re: jms-Season 5 Acting differences after SIL

I think it did add a small note of somberness and foreshadowing to the S5
performances of a few cast members, which is why I had previously avoided
letting them know too much, to avoid the trap of having them play the result
instead of the process.  It happens.
