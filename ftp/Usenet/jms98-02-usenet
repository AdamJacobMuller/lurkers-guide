Bill is still on the show; there's a bit of a break as his character is off on
anla-shok training, but he does come back, and in fact has a rather substantial
arc of his own at a certain point later in the season.

Yes and no...the last part of the season is very tight, 17-19 are very much of
a piece, 20 sets up one final thread, then 21 and 22 are more designed to *lead
up to* the held-over 422.  That's one of the main differences...if it'd aired
at the end of S4, it would've been a bit of a jump, but now can lead up to it
more smoothly.

White Stars are not invulnerable.  If they saw what they were told were a

White Stars.  A Pearl Harbor style attack on White Stars would effectively

working with the composer on music, others on sound, more CGI, other stuff),
dealing with the mountain of licensing approvals that has piled up on my desk
due to being more interested in the show than that stuff, and (one hopes)
shortly gearing up for Crusade.

Also just had a new 4-hour miniseries that I wrote optioned by a major company.

An option is the standard protocol in deal making.  It is a fee paid to the
writer allowing the studio or network to hold onto the material while it puts
together the rest of the deal.  Consider it a downpayment.  Once the deal is in
place, the rest of the money follows.

Nope.

Look carefully at the station.  It is in segments; and at the outer wall of
each of those segments, as with the sanctuary, you can get an outer view.  You
can see the lights from some of these areas that have portholes in the station
when it's dark.

Subject: Re: ATTN JMS: My Take on Season 5

Charles, at risk of being terribly unproducerish...will you for chrsissakes
relax?

Everything you're saying about Lochley here -- and I mean EVERYTHING -- was
said about Claudia Christian when she came on board as Ivanova.  "Oh, she's
wooden, she's trying to hard to be tough, get rid of her and bring back
Takashima."

I told people to give her time, they'd learn that there's more there than meets
the eye.  They said I was making excuses for a poor casting choice.  So let's
all just give the woman and the character a chance, okay?  You've seen her now
in a total of 3 episodes, which were designed to put her toe-to-toe with
Garibaldi.  There's more there.

And yeah, I wanted to give viewers a rest-up for a bit after the excesses of
S4.  Okay, so you can't see where it's going.  That's okay by me (you don't see
the coming telepath situation, for starters?)...people were saying in seasons 1
and most of 2 that they didn't see it then, either...then they saw it when I
chose to let it be seen.  

This year has one of the most intense series of arcs we've ever DONE.  And by
the end of it you'll be happy you HAD these few lighter episodes because I'm
going to kick the crap out of the viewers.  We have not just one, but two and
maybe (depending on how it comes out) three episodes this season I'd put toe to
toe with Coming of Shadows for intensity, for arc, for major shifts.

Further:

People saw "By Any Means Necessary," and said it wasn't an arc episode...it was
just about a strike.  But later, after what came up, this was seen as the FIRST
EPISODE in the real turn-around and reversal of Londo/G'kar...here Londo was
being the bad guy for the first time, and here G'Kar was showing a spiritual
side.  That one episode marked the absolute start of that reversal...which only
became clear well AFTER the fact.  DURING the fact, I had to put up with people
assuming that it had nothing to do with the arc.

How can you say you don't think it's going anywhere when you haven't seen where
it's gone?  

Y'know if I were just an audience member, I'd be sitting back and enjoying this
show and wondering where it's going to go without making judgements based on
ZERO information on where it is or isn't going.  Have you read the scripts?  Do
you know what's in 518?  

Have you seen the shot where a tearful Delenn embraces Londo for what may be
the last time?  Have you seen the phoenix that rises out of Byron's actions? 
Have you heard about the bombing of Psi Corps back home?  Have you seen what's
living under the palace on Centauri Prime?  Have you seen what the regent sees
when he looks up on the very last night of his life?  Have you seen the
terrible darkness that Lennier discovers at the worst possible moment of his
life?  Have you seen the REAL other side of Lyta, and what she can do?  Have
you seen the Drazi homeworld, and the terrible secret they're hiding there?  

Have you?

Because that's only a FRACTION of what is coming this season, the smallest
part.

Maybe you're getting reruns of episodes...I'm getting reruns of comments from
past seasons...which were shown to be wrong then, and they're wrong now.

Let's talk about Season 5 as a whole once you've actually SEEN it, shall we?

I'm sorry, but this comment ranks in the top ten percentile of astonishingly
paralogical remarks I've ever seen.  What you're saying here is that the ONLY
thing that constitutes an arc is if the audience sees it before it happens, if
it's told it's there...as opposed to an arc that becomes clear in the light of
FUTURE EVENTS.

But an arc IS A STORY THAT GOES INTO THE FUTURE EVENTS.  That is the very
DEFINITION of it.  How many people here said they started watching B5 in its
first season and didn't know there was an arc until "Signs and Portents?" 
Plenty, I've seen them.  So unless it's *predictible*, unless you've been
briefed ahead of time that something's coming, paying it off in the future,
which is how I'm writing it, doesn't count.

Yes, I referred to future developments because THAT IS WHAT AN ARC IS, future
developments.  

This is the most astonishing conversation I've had on the nets in months.

Excuse me, I think I'll go get a ball peen hammer and bang myself between the

Subject: Re: Strawmen, irritation with

Russ:

You're setting up just as many strawmen as those you cite.

Basic and fundamental truism: if somebody doesn't like an episode, I'm
absolutely okay with that.  Some episodes, like the Mack and Bo show, the
coming Psi Corps show, Deconstruction, those are written with the full
knowledge that it's going to divide people's opinions.  I *expect* that it'll
be cleanly divided between those who hate it, and those who love it. 

Basic and fundamental truism #2: No show, no single episode, will appeal to
everyone.  It's a bell curve: some at one end will hate it, some at the other
will love it, most will be generally in the middle.  It's if that bell curve
starts to skew one way or the other that you have to watch.

All that I and others have been doing is pointing out realities to those who
have, in essence, said that something isn't there when it is.  How many times
lately have I read, here or on other nets, "Now that we're in reruns we see all
the threads that tied the show together that we didn't see before, all the
foreshadowings of what was to come."  

There's a lot of stuff seeded in these early episodes that will, as with the
first several seasons, be more apparent in retrospect.  That's ALWAYS been the
case with B5.  

I'm also trying to provide a historical perspective.  People jump on Lochley
saying she's wooden (meaning she doesn't overact and chew the scenery as with
so much of what passes for TV acting)...and preferring Ivanova...completely
forgetting that for most of the first season, and then some, people were
complaining that Ivanova was wooden, they didn't like her Russian accent (which
she didn't even have), they said "dump her."  They did the same thing with Vir.
 "Flounder in space!  Throw him out an airlock."

Then, later, as the characters continue on, the opinions change.  This has been
the pattern from the very first day of this show.  I see nothing wrong with
noting this.  If it's proper to critique the show, and it is, good or bad, why
is it bad to critique the criticisms and bring a historical perspective to the
discussion?

Look...if somebody doesn't like an episode, I'm fine with that, always have
been.  It's when it enters into the sweeping generalizations category,
paralogia or downright silliness about the season as a whole, which nobody's
seen yet, that I finally have to say "c'mon..."

I've actually heard from some other folks on other SF style shows that our
tendency to push things has make it a bit easier for them to get tougher
stories through.  This is a Good Thing.  The more quality SF series, the better
for everybody.

Subject: Re: ATTN JMS - Seven Days In May and the Earth arc


Thanks...Seven Days in May is an excellent movie, one of several that, if I'm
channel-surfing and come across, I can't *not* watch it.  They did a more
recent version of it for cable -- HBO, I think -- but the original will always
be my favorite.  

And yeah, Rod had an amazing way with words...still holds me in awe.

BTW, if you liked that one, I commend Fail Safe to you as well as The
Manchurian Candidate.

Yes, there are ten Zathri...despite the restraining order.

That comes pretty close...it's a matter of looking at the logistics and
backgrounds of people and, if a thread has to be adjusted ("What do you MEAN
Wayne Alexander just got hit by an asteroid?!) you look at the next logical
person in the show whom you can then beat up even further.  

It's not quite "one of you step forward," but it's close.

And sometimes it's a situation where you know that actor X hasn't had as much
to do as might've been the case, and an opening in thread A lets you do more
with that person.

Subject: Re: Very Interesting Experiment/Suggestion


What the experiment also does, which you touch on, is to show how changing an
angle on an actor, making it a close-up rather than a long shot, can make the
scene more or less dynamic...how you can get out of scenes earlier than in the
first version, and thus pick up the pace.  

It is, as you say, most educational.

Whether it was TNT or someone else, it was inevitable that someone would pick
up the reruns of the show; so I put stuff in to work both ways, as
foreshadowing, and things you could pick up on later, on re-viewing, that
suddenly jump out at you.

No, I came up with that song for the episode, and designed it to sound like any
of a zillion other such songs out there, so it'd sound familiar.
