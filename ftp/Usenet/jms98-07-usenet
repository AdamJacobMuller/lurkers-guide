Subject: Why More Producers Aren't Here

Here's a small slice of life to explain why more producers and cast members
aren't online.

I kept getting emails (and public postings) from a fellow going by the handle
of goodx6 here on AOL (goodx6@aol.com).  I have said before that I would rather
that general plot questions (which these were) would be addressed in the public
forums, but frankly, these were not questions that I really felt warranted
answering because much of it had been covered.  So I didn't answer, and spent
that time answering other questions.

More of the same exact emails continued to come in.  I ignored them.  The
person in question then *demanded* that I answer his emails and his public
messages.  I explained that I did not *have* to answer any questions at all,
and with limited time, tried to put my efforts and energies into questions we
hadn't already covered.  He sent another very harrassing note, and I plinked
him.

So today, I found out I couldn't get email (and there were several important B5
related emails that should have been here).  I found that I couldn't receive
ANY email because I had received nearly 1,000 emails from the same account
(masquerading under two different names, but sending identical emails) saying
that I was a queer for not answering goodx6's questions.  (The handles were
jesus4834 and TWare97181.)  Obviously goodx6 either asked this person to do
this, since the conversation was originally carried out in email, or they are
all the same person.

The assumption here seems to be that I am *required* to respond to inquiries,
and that if I don't, I'm entitled to be harrassed.  

This is not the first time this has happened to me.  And this will probably not
be the last.  It took me about 20 minutes to clear out my mailbox, deleting
almost 1,000 harrassing emails by hand, another 10 minutes to send on the info
to AOL's terms of service...and it shoved out all the online AOL email
backfiles, some of which I use for reference.

And this is the kind of thing that after a while makes one more convinced that
pulling away down the road is exactly the right thing to do.

Subject: Re: ATTN: JMS: in the spinoff...

My feeling for now is to make the feature, if one gets done, fairly
self-contained, since I imagine a lot of folks may go who haven't seen the
show.

It would be a question of what the group of rogue telepaths had *done* prior to
his running into them.  If, for instance, they had killed any of his fellow Psi
Cops, I think (to turn a phrase on its head) the gloves would come off.

Byron's people weren't a threat to Psi Cops until the very end.

I guess opinions vary...I think it looks kind cool.

Question: did you get the one that actually says Kosh, or the Vorlon Visitor
figure?  If the latter, the color scheme is off because it ain't Kosh.  The one
that says Kosh is pretty close, in my view.

Got mine the other day, and rather like it.

>LD's go without the WS treatment.

WB is one of those big companies where one branch often doesn't know what the
other is doing.  No one told me about the LDs until I heard about it on the
nets, because it never occured to anyone to mention it.  (I've since mentioned
it to the folks at Image, so we'll see about the WS stuff.)  

What you have to understand is that the video aspect of the show is not
considered by contract a part of merchandising.  (I know, doesn't make any
sense, but it's one more way of keeping money out of the hands of the writers
involved.  Same with soundtracks, so I don't get a piece off either of those
except for the WGA mandated royalty, which is more or less zero.)  

As some note of how far off these things can be, a big full-page ad in Video
Magazine this month for the VHS tapes mentions that the show  is now on TNT,
instead of **UPN*** (it began on PTEN, which is WB, as opposed to UPN, which is
Paramount).

>Do you watch your own shows after they are done?  If yes, (and I assume it is

I watch the episodes bunches of times; pieces during shooting in dailies, the
directors cut (twice, once to just watch, again to make my notes), again when
John and I do our producer's cut/edit, again when we do the audio spotting
(sound EFX and music), again when we mix the episode, again on VHS to check how
it sounds on a regular TV stereo, and again when it airs to check the
transmission.  That's 7 times just to start.

It takes me about a year or two to be able to really *see* the show,  to stop
anticipating each line before I hear it.

Thanks...apparently, some dealers are selling the book(s) for a couple hundred

Which is why the next one I write has got to be a good one, because a lot of
folks will probably pick it up as an act of faith and a compliment to B5, and I
don't want to disappoint them.

Subject: Re: Thirdspace--------Why?

Okay, you want an answer to this, I got an answer for you.

Because I felt like it.

Because I've done five years worth of angst and dark storytelling, and I wanted
to do one story that was just for fun.  

Because I'm a huge fan of the type of Cthulhu mythos stories done by H. P.
Lovecraft and August Derleth and Clark Ashton Smith and Lord Dunsany, and all
my life I wanted to just cut loose and do something like that.

Because I hadn't done a story like that for B5, and I want to try new things,
experiment, do a funny story, a spooky story, a high-tech story.

And because a show needs to be shaken up once in a while.  

A while back, Neil Gaiman pointed out to me that the problem with a certain
percentage of fandom is that they like your work for what it is, because it's
different, but then they won't tolerate any variation from what you're doing,
and what you've done in the past.  They condemn it because it isn't exactly
what they figured they would be getting.

No, this wasn't a huge part of the arc, which is one of the main complaints (as
is the case here).  So what?  Look, not everything that happens to me in my
life, or you in yours, is part of a specific thematic arc.  I came up with the
idea of a five year arc as a tool to give me MORE flexibility in storytelling,
to add a new tool to the form...not to find myself being told that if I do
something outside that very rigid arc that it's meaningless and shouldn't have
been made.

It was meant to be a light entertainment set in the B5 universe, nothing more,
nothing less.  That should be the purpose of the movies, to do some hard-arc
stuff, some lightly related stuff, and some stuff that is totally
self-contained...heavy stories and light stories, to provide the freedom to
*play* in the B5 universe.

And *that's* why I wrote the thing.  

And the ratings were terrific, with each quarter hour improving over the one
before, and I've gotten more positive email from people who have never watched
the show before than I have on anything else.  Because you don't have to know
the show to just sit back and enjoy this one.

Not everything should require that you do a massive amount of homework in order
to watch it; not everything has to be of the arc; not everything has to be
about angst.

I wrote this one just for fun.  

If you don't like it, fine; but to say it should not have been written, that
somehow it doesn't belong in the arc and therefore in your opinion shouldn't
exist, ain't your call to make, frankly, and just slaps on more limitations.

This is why there is so little divergence in the Star Trek shows; the studio
has learned that it has to more and more narrowly define what constitutes a
Star Trek story...and in time it becomes so narrow that you can't do much of
anything new in it.  

What the hell is the point of HAVING your own show if you can't from time to
time go out and just do a story that's completely off-base, just for fun, just
for yourself?  If nobody watches it, then you've got a problem...but in fact
this came out to be the 5th highest rated cable movie of the week, so by gosh a
lot of other people liked it as well.

I'm not defending the movie because there is nothing to defend.  It succeeded
for me, creatively, and it succeeded for TNT in the ratings, we got to test out
some new tech and CGI, and I got to fulfill a years-long desire to play with a
kind of Old Ones/Lovecraftian story.

Deal with it.

Maybe *you* want to so narrowly define the B5 universe that something like this
could not be done...but *I* have no interest in doing that.

The moment you lose the ability to change the format and play and tip-over the
whole thing, and do totally arbitrary things because they please you...you may
as well find yourself a comely shroud, because creatively you're dead.

Who was the one person whose wife actually wrote a letter to the London Times
suggesting that the ripper maybe was trying to tell them something, and that
maybe he'd stop if they listened?  Who was the last person to see at least two
of the victims alive on missions of mercy to the jail?  Who was reported to
have become unhinged by the filth in the area around the murders when he found
a rat in his breakfast? Who had medical experience? Who left England suddenly
after being questioned, with the murders stopping soon afterward?  Whose
transcripts of interviews with church officials and British police are *still*
kept under lock and key? Who is the sort of person who might say -- as the only
witness to hear the ripper reported hearing him remark to one of his victims --
"You would do anything but pray?"  Who had the same last name -- and was a
likely relative -- of the man living with the very last victim, the only one
killed in her room (suggesting she knew the killer)?

The Reverend Samuel Barnett.  That's my choice.

Exactly.  That was the challenge, to make it work on an episodic basis, but
then run together.  

This particularly works in S5 starting from about "Meditations" right through
"Sleeping in Light."  Just play it straight through, and it's one long episode.
