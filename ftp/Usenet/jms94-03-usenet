     Episode #5 is the two year anniversary of B5 going on-line; not
two years since the pilot movie.  It took about a year and a half to
grow to this point, and for the final of the Big 5 ambassadors, Kosh, to
arrive, completing the group.  It's now roughly six months after that,
into the new year.

     Thanks for noticing that.  Yes, it *was* very important (to me, at
least, whether or not anyone noticed it), that Ivanova was the one who
handed Talia the water, and had that brief moment with her.  For those who
understand their relationship, it adds a tiny layer; for those who don't,
because the dialogue keeps on going over it, it's not obtrusive.

Subject: Disappointed in Babylon-5

     Just some brief responses:
 
     1) Aliens aren't *alien* enough.  You mention that the other shows
get gigged on this too, so B5 shouldn't be exempt, though you then go on
to note that we still have to cast on earth.  Question is, therefore, is
the expectation realistic?  Fact is, no matter what ANYONE does, ANY
alien on ANY tv series or movie is going to be written from a human point
of view because it's a human writing it, and a human acting the part.
There will never be an authentic alien until an alien really appears; the
rest is just human speculation.  (And if you want to go for a really weird
approach, remember that this is a visual medium, and having someone talking
to a clam doesn't work *visually*.  You can do stuff in a novel that you
simply cannot do in TV or movies.)
 
     2) The episodic format.  I take the liberty of disagreeing with you,
both in your premise and your conclusion.  Forget what anyone else ahs
(has) said, or what you intuit.  What I said from Day One was this: that
every episode *will stand on its own*, offering a complete story, but that
over time, the accumulation of those stories will begin to present a much
larger arc.  That was the promise.  Yes, stories are for the most part
wrapped up in an hour.  That's precisely the point.  What we're going for
is a *cumulative* approach, not a *consecutive* approach.  The more you
learn about the characters and the situations, the more you can pick up
on stuff.  Further, threads introduced in one episode *do* carry over;
you see the problem with Ivanova, her mother, and the Psi Corps recurring
in a very major way in "Eyes," "Legacies" and other episodes.
 
     It is a *cumulative* process.  You have thus far seen 5 or 6 episodes.
 We're talking long term here.  Further, don't hold me to a promise that
I didn't make.  I said the shows would stand alone...and now you say that
it's a broken promise, that the shows are resolved.  Yes, they are; that
was the intent.  It's the *characters* and the larger threads that are
not resolved within the hour.
 
     3) The politics aren't very political.  Again, you're making a
conclusion based on insufficient evidence.  "Deathwalker" is almost
ENTIRELY politics and back-room deals between not only the Big Five
governments, but also the League of Non-Aligned Worlds, just for
starters.  Politics back home makes a MAJOR impact on the show in such
episodes as "Eyes," "A Voice in the Wilderness," "Survivors" and other
upcoming, filmed episodes.
 
     You're looking for immediate gratification, as if this were a short
story.  I'll say it again: this is a *novel* for television.  Every
promise made will be kept.
 
     The sciences...we'll have to agree to disagree on this one.
 
     My main point is, you're alternately holding me to promises I
didn't make, or gigging us for not doing things when in fact we *have*
done them, *have* filmed them, they just haven't aired yet.
 
     Having said all of that...the biggest hit TV series, according to
ratings and research services, have a large number of viewers who love it,
a smaller number who think it's okay, and a smaller number who *hate* it.
No TV series is ever going to appeal to 100% of the audience; it hasn't
happened, and will never happen.  It just may not be your kind of show.

Subject: JMS: More Questions

     I see no problem with the synopses.
 
     The Xon did evolve into fair amount of intelligence.  There are a
very few land masses on Centauri Prime, separated by huge oceans.  The
two species evolved pretty much separately, on different continents that
were absolutely unreachable until one or both sides developed sufficient
technology for extended sea travel...and that's when all hell broke
loose.
 
     Psi ratings vary a little, but not much; a P5 can be made into a P6,
but not much more.  Generally, what you are is what you are.
 
     (Many lower-level psi's, P1-P2s, are tracked by the Psi Corps, but
don't officially belong to it or function in any official capacity, as
their skills are *so* minimal or erratic as to be of virtually no real
use.  Still, they have to be tracked and logged for genetic purposes.)
 
     With only one exception, you won't see time travel anywhere in the
five-year run of the B5 story.

     The PPGs are Phased Plasma Guns, using superheated helium.  It
doesn't ricochet like conventional slugs, dissipates quickly after a hit,
can be adjusted to produce surface damage, or cut straight through the
body, or to make a big impact without burning through.  At full strength,
they burn straight through any kind of body, causing massive internal
burns and damage to the internal organs.  The clothes melt right into the
skin.  It's not a pretty thing.  Generally they're operated at a lower
or less lethal setting.

story than was on the agenda, which I thought was better than what I had
in mind for that slot, and used the same characters, so that worked out.)
 We determined how many episodes all the characters were needed for, and
made our deals accordingly.

     Next year, as the story escalates, the plan is to make all of our
alien ambassadors available for 22 out of 22, allowing us to be far more
flexible.

     Perhaps you wouldn't have so many people "pounding" on you if you
avoided the tendency to run your mouth out of turn.  First you posted a
false notice from VARIETY stating that I had been fired off my own show,
and posted it on various nets as though it were the real thing.  You were
caught out in this, mumbled about being unfairly targeted, but never
showed the *least* regret over doing it.  You smeared my name, and never
once apologized.

     Nonetheless, I offered an open hand, and said "We begin again," if
you recall, figuring that everyone is owed one act of boorishness.  Then
came your current screed.  You backtracked and said that you didn't
understand the context, that you assumed wrongly...did it occur to you to
ASK FIRST?  No.  You started throwing around messages with allegations of
racism.  You didn't ask for clarification, you started screaming
"Racist."  And once it was explained to you...again, no apology, just a
mumbled comment about being confused and making assumptions.

     Have you ever considered not running your mouth for a change, not
smearing people, not spreading rumors, not calling people offensive
names?  Just because you were born with fingers doesn't mean you have to
use them at a keyboard when your brain is clearly vapor-locked.  I don't
know what problem causes you to engage in this kind of behavior, but in
future keep it far away from me.  I didn't care for your hoax, I didn't
care for your malicious rumors, I didn't care for your allegations, and
I don't much like your "poor me" act now that you've gotten your dick
caught in the door again.

     Grow up and act like a man or get the fuck out of public view,

SF; the kind of person who gives the rest of us a bad name.

Subject: Sky -- comments and other thou

     Since I don't know how to send an individual message to this alt
section -- I can only reply to notes in my GEnie mailbox -- I would like
to pass along the following.

     Networks usually renew their shows at the end of the season, when
they've seen all the shows.  Syndication, and PTEN in particular, works
differently.  The decision on whether or not to renew will be made in
April/early May.  One factor complicating all of this is the new
Paramount network, which is grabbing up stations and available timeslots
by the bucket.  They are, apparently, making very good deals.

     Point being...if you truly enjoy Babylon 5, I would suggest that
the next two weeks would be the ideal time to write your local TV
station -- which has a *direct* say in whether or not B5 is picked up --
and tell them so.  It's kinda unfair to have to decide on a show after
only a handful of episodes, but that's the hand all the PTEN shows have
been dealt.

     Would definitely be appreciated.

     There are over 200 pages of single-spaced notes, plus individual

think it's fair to set up questions unless you know the answer well in
advance.  So yes, it is all worked out.  I tried to take a fairly
Tolkein-esque approach, fleshing out as much as possible of the B5
universe, whether or not it ever gets actually used.

Subject: Schedule?  Repeats already?!?

     Here is the dilemma in which we find ourselves.  In the Good Olde
Days of TeeVee, the new season (remember when there WAS a "Fall season?")
began around September (in time for the November and February sweeps), and
ended around the May sweeps.  Then Summer reruns through August.  The
sweeps periods are the very competitive periods in which stations are
monitored in order to set the price they can charge for commercials.  This
is a VERY important time for the stations, and they want new product.

     We go on the air in February.  No problem hitting the May sweeps.
But the stations need new shows to also air in November.  So that means
you have to stretch 22 episodes so that you'll still have new ones come
November.  It's a pain, but that's what we're stuck with.

                                                                          jms

just encourages mindfuckers to play at keeping the numbers low, in a way
that has *nothing* to do with the show itself.

Subject: Re: ATSFOS-Tossing bodies out

     "But the line about the body being bound to the station by gravity
was idiocy of the most annoying kind, because it blatantly screams that
the people writing and producing the show don't bother to check the most
trivial elements of the science they portray.  What they happen to get
right, they get right by sheer coincidence."

     The only thing that I would agree with in your analysis is the word
"idiot."  I would, however, apply it in your direction, since you so
willingly applied it in mine, as the person who writes and produces this
show.

     1) We do fairly thorough research into the science of our show.  We
work hard at it.  We subscribe to the various scientific journals, we
use advisors on stuff we don't fully understand ourselves.  We make a
concerted, conscious and deliberate effort to get the science *right*,
as much as is practical within a TV format.

     2) Your attitude is the kind of reprehensible crap I get from people
who aren't paying attention, and just assume that if something isn't done
to what THEY consider satisfactory, that people are just sluffing it off,
that they're idiots, they don't bother.  My response: who the fuck are
you?  Where the fuck were YOU when we were having production meeting after
productin meeting trying to determine how to do some of this stuff?  I
didn't see your name on the list, didn't see you in the room, where do you
get off characterizing our attitude?

     And now for the good part.

     3) This weekend, I was at the Space Frontier Foundation to receive an
award for Babylon 5 for Best Vision of the Future, part of which was its
recognition of our *deliberate efforts* to get things right.  Zero-G
maneuvering, civilian use of space, a working O'Neill station, on and on,
all the stuff you think  happens by "coincidence."  And which has not
generally HAPPENED on TV before.  In attendence were the Delta Clipper
team of engineers, astronaut Pete Conrad, leading researchers with NASA,
JPL, McDonnell-Douglas, you name it.

     And one of the people there, who had been with SDI and the Space
Program for 12 years, currently a top-level NASA consultant, pulled me
aside and said that after seeing the line about the gravity not letting
the body get very far -- and THAT is what was said in the script, and in
the episode, NOT your characterization of a body "bound" to the hull --
he said he sat down to do the math required to come up with the actuall
MASS of B5, starting with the 2.5 million tons of actual structure, plus
likely vegetation, quarters, occupants, ships docked inside...and when
you add it all up, it came to about the same mass as a fairly small
moon...and IT WOULD BE ENOUGH TO KEEP THE BODY FROM -- AS STATED IN THE
SCRIPT -- GETTING VERY FAR.

     The body would drift from the station a bit, get pulled back, hit
the hull, bounce, drift a bit, and be pulled back.  Or go into a slow
elliptical orbit.  (He mentioned that in the history of the Apollo
program, little bits of debris that would flake off the outside of the
ship would remain in proximity to the ship, just on the basis of ITS
mass and gravity, and it's not very big.)

     A couple of other high-level engineers backed him up, and said that
it was quite reasonable.

     What's the difference?  THEY sat down and did the math.  YOU just
sat down and ran your mouth, and decided to go around insulting people
for being inaccurate when in fact YOU are the one who "didn't bother to
check the most trivial elements of the science."  I don't think you really
grasp how big this place is, and how massive it is, and its effect on the
surrounding area.

     I, however, DO know how massive the station is, and DID bother to
call around to a few people I know who know this stuff even better than I
do, to ask them about this *before I wrote it*, just to be sure.

     I put your message on the same level as the occasional screed that
flies through here blathering on about how there shouldn't be gravity in
the observation dome since it's in the center of the station WITHOUT
stopping to LOOK at the goddamned thing and see that it's 1/3rd of the
way down FROM the center, giving at least 1/3rd G.

     Let me tell you a story.  It's about Van Gogh.  He was due to be
visited for the first time by his idol, Gauguin.  He covered the walls of
his home with his paintings, and awaited Gauguin's arrival.  Gauguin came.
 One by one, he walked down the line of paintings.  Upon coming to the
end of the paintings, he turned to Van Gogh and said, "You paint too
fast."

     "No," Van Gogh said, "you LOOK too fast."

     You look too fast.

     And next time, you might want to actually CHECK your figures before
you go around calling people idiots.

     Blockhead.

     It is unfortunate that because ST has for so many years been the
only game in town, everything gets measured next to it.  Part of this
is the fact that there have *been* very few marginally successful SF
shows, unlike mainstream shows, in which there have now been so many cop
series that comparisons to any one show get kinda lost or drowned out.

     As for the Gene Roddenberry comparison...I cringed at that as well,
not in any kind of insulting way, but just because I want to do my own
stuff.  I'm not the next Roddenberry; I'm the first jms.  He did what he
did, and I'm doing what I'm doing.  (Another article used the phrased, "is
inheriting the mantle of Gene Roddenberry."  When this hit the stands,
Harlan called and asked when the mantle arrived, did it come FedEx or
regular mail, could he come see it, and where did I intend to hang it?)

     It is the nature of the journalistic beast....

     What you're seeing is a standard TV series "bumper," same as is used
on most shows.

     The "little fuck" story is absolutely, completely untrue.
