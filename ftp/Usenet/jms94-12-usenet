Subject: Ship Names (minor ADS spoiler)

     So tell me, Ligia, if Cortez had NOT landed in northern Mexico, do
you think it would have remained undiscovered until now?

     Fact #1: somebody was bound to discover the Americas.

     Fact #2: any sufficiently advanced civilization or culture will
inevitably attempt to exploit any civilization or culture not sufficiently
advanced to fight back on a level playing field.

     Blaming explorers for exploring has always seemed to me really kind
of silly; do people *really* think that if Columbus hadn't landed here,
it'd be 1994 and we still wouldn't know the world was round and that
this continent was here?  It doesn't matter who discovered it, the same
result would've come.  Somebody had to discover it sooner or later.

     First people complained that Sinclair wasn't expressive enough; now
they complain that Sheridan's TOO expressive...Sinclair smiled too much,
then he was too serious...now Sheridan smiles too much....

he's called as overly expressive as Shatner....

     I dunno...maybe the hangup some people have with Shatner is the
problem...and maybe they ought to get over it.

     This is, of course, one of the great ironies of any free society,
that in order to BE a free society you have to create the very conditions
that could turn right around and destroy that freedom.  You have to
allow things you don't like in the hope that there are enough checks and
balances, and enough attractions to the current system to encourage
folks not to change over.  (I think it was Che Guevara who said that
every nation is three meals short of revolution.)

     I keep playing with the notion of an opening narration a year or two
down the road that says, "the Babylon Project was our last, best hope for
peace.  It failed."

Subject: ATT JMS:  What would have happ

     Okay, alternate-universe time to answer your question....

     "What if Sinclair had not left Babylon 5?"  (Isn't this kinda like
the Marvel What If? comics..."What If Dr. Blake's Nurse Had Been The One
to Find Thor's Hammer?")

     The differences would be more noticeable in the later episodes of
this season, rather than the first batch, which are still dealing in
large measure with the after-effects of the season finale.

     So the first few episodes would have been somewhat the same in some
ways to what is there with Sheridan.  The problem that I had was that he
was becoming (and would have become) mainly a problem-solver character;
there's a squabble or a problem between other characters who are rising in
profile (G'Kar, Londo, Delenn, etc.), and he solves the problem in some
way.  These, to me, were the least interesting episodes of our prior
season.

     It would've been necessary to bring in another character with a
direct connection to the shadowmen, since Sinclair's main connection is
to the Minbari, and it would've been straining credulity to plug him too
much into THAT story as well...hero of the line, missing 24 hours, Minbari
soul, AND a tie to the Shadowmen...c'mon, what else does he do, fly under
his own power?

     Had he stayed, the Shadowman tie probably would've gone to either
Keffer or Garibaldi.  Which, again, further removes Sinclair from the
main thrust of the story.  He would have stayed on as more of an observer
of other people *acting*, while he *reacted*.

     I can't get too specific otherwise without revealing, by contrast,
what's going to happen later on this season.  Suffice to say this: watch
the show up to and through "The Coming of Shadows," "All Alone in the
Night," "Acts of Sacrifice," and "Hunter, Prey."  (That's about episode
#13.)  You can then ask the question again, but I have a real suspicion
that once you've seen those episodes, and what Sheridan does, you won't
NEED to ask, because you'll see how he fits into the overall story in a
very specific fashion with is 180-degrees different than Sinclair.

                                                                       jms

Subject: Sinclair Who? or The Long Dark

     Re: Sheridan...thanks, and I think you'll continue to like him more
the deeper we get into the season and we discover what's *really* going
on with him.  Last season, "Chrysalis" was the episode at season's end
that kind of turned the show on its head; this season it starts a LOT
sooner than that...there are several episodes mid-season that whop the
series upside the head and send it spinning in a very different direction,
and they mainly involve Sheridan.  In particular, watch for "A Race
Through Dark Places," "The Coming of Shadows," "All Alone in the Night"
(which is a biggie, though it's designed NOT to look like that for most
of the episode), "Acts of Sacrifice" and "Hunter, Prey."  With one or
two exceptions, they run in a block come February.

                                                                   jms

group is "Geometry.")  I think "The Coming of Shadows" may be the best
(or at least my favorite) from the entire series to date.  I'd also put
"Chrysalis," "Babylon Squared," "A Race Through Dark Places" and
"Revelations" toward the top.  I suspect that "All Alone in the Night"
will be up there, but I just today got the director's cut, and haven't
seen it yet, though the dailies were terrific.

     McCallum was *very* pleasant to work with, very unassuming and
quiet.  We've been very lucky with our guest stars; they have a strong
respect for the text, and don't stray.  And they bring a lot to each
performance.  On the subject of genre actors...they often created great
characters, so memorable that they got typecast, and couldn't find work.
This to me is a crime, and if we can cast them in ways totally opposite
what they've done before (Koenig as Bester), and show the real range and
skill these actors possess, we pay back a little of what they've given
us, which we kinda owe them, I think.  It's simply a gesture of respect.

there was killing of Minbari by Minbari.  There were three warring castes,
which he pulled together when he formed the Grey Council (three from each
caste forming nine, Worker, Warrior, Religious Caste).  Since that time,
and the Minbari have been in space for well over a thousand years, they
have pretty much hewn to that rule; it is their greatest taboo.  Once the
three sides were integrated, the warrior caste mainly contented itself
with external threats.

Subject: Not exactly technobabble... (b

     I don't think referring to a medical problem or illness is in any
way either technobabble or medbabble.  Either babble is just that, a long
string of terms which suffice for plot points.  New medical conditions
come along all the time, and require names.  Twenty years ago we didn't
have the term AIDS.  If that had been used prior to the illness being
discovered, would that be considered technobabble?

     I think we need to be somewhat sensible here; from time to time one
must explain something or refer to something of a technical nature.  I
don't think that this must lead to a kneejerk response of classifying
any kind of technical reference as technobabble.  Terms have meaning,
and the more you generalize those terms, the less meaning they have.

one (occasionally blipping onto the modem while the dinosaur part of my
brain tries to work out a story point), then do the bulk of my modeming
live and on-line from then through the wee hours.  Then I crash and do it
all over again the next day.  (I can use Tapcis for some off-line

     Okay, let's see, what can I tell you to tide you over...the next
six new episodes that'll run are, in order, "A Race Through Dark Places,"
"The Coming of Shadows," "GROPOS," "All Alone in the Night," and "Acts of
Sacrifice," with "Hunter, Prey" being the final new one in that cycle.

     I can say that all of those episodes (with the nominal exception of
"GROPOS," which though it is a solid arc episode doesn't change the
overall direction of the series) are stories that have major and
substantial effects on the show's direction. In season one, we built all
season to maybe three major WHAM episodes.  ("Sky," "Signs," "Chrysalis.")
This year we have double that number at minimum, and with greater impact.

     All of our major characters will start going through major
upheavals in their lives during this period.  It's a *very* intense six
weeks.  Several characters make decisions that completely change the
direction of the show, and the way their character fits in with the
series.  One episode will look very much unconnected to the arc until the
last five minutes, at which point there's a revelation that will likely
astonish some and confirm suspcions for some other viewers.

     Simply put, by the end of those six episodes, in many ways the show
you're used to isn't the same anymore, and the relationships between
several major characters simply aren't the same anymore.  And most
interesting for me is that we get to push some of the characters'
emotions to the very edge...and snap them.

     These six represent some of the strongest episodes we've ever done;
I consider "Coming" to be probably the best episode to date.  In "GROPOS"
we're going for broke and are doing some *amazing* CGI stuff.

     How's that for a start?

Subject: JMS:  Londo and Shakespeare? (

     The interesting thing for me in this and related conversations is
that I frequently notice messages indicating that "jms is doing the whole
Kennedy thing," or it's the Lord of the Rings, or it's Dune, or it's
tracking the Bible, or it's following Yeats...or it echoes Shakespeare,
as in this case.

     In a way, they're all right, and in a way, they're all wrong.  Right
in the sense that in trying to create myth, or a story using traditional
epic structure, you can see echoes not only between B5 and other such
stories, but also between those other epics.  The mistake is in thinking
(and this isn't directed at you, just sorta woolgathering) that it is in
fact a parallel to any one of them.  That leads you into the error of the
blind men each touching a part of an elephant; if you think the trunk IS
the elephant, you've erred, and all conclusions that follow are thus
skewed incorrectly.

     To the question of Shakespeare and Londo...yes, there's some
resonance there, because Londo is an almost archetypal tragic/comic, or
romantic/tragic figure.  There was certainly a fair amount of Falstaff in
him; references to consulting three technomages certainly resonates with
MacBeth being "endorsed" as it were by the three witches.  You can look at
Londo and see Lear, or Hamlet, or others...and they all resonate to one
degree or another, but none of them is wholecloth.

     Right now, all that most viewers have of the B5 story is a piece of
the elephant, and are assuming that that *is* the elephant.  Another good
comparison would be to say that if you stop a reader part way into The
Lord of the Rings, they'll assume it's all about some hobbits on the road,
having adventures.  Because they don't yet know about Mordor, or Sauron,
or the Rings, or Rivendell, or the sheer *scope* of the thing.  I don't
think anyone has yet twigged to what this story is, really.

     One of the things really lacking in American culture, I think, is a
sense of *myth*.  So the story of Babylon 5 has a very mythic kind of
structure.  I think that's important.  Which is why a lot of the elements
I draw on aren't traditional television devices...literature, poetry,
religion, hard SF, metafiction, Jungian symbology...there are an awful
lot of ingredients in this particular pie, culled from the less likely
aisles in the supermarket.  You have to remember that my degrees are in
psychology and sociology, with minors in literature and philosophy.  So
my tastes and predilections and resources are fairly eclectic and lean
toward the classical.  (How else to explain an atheist who's read the
Bible cover to cover *twice*?)

     And I think I just answered your question in far more detail than
could possibly have been desired....

Subject: Observations on Season Two to

     The only quibble I have with your message, and it's a small one, is
your statement, "The success of Trek made B5 possible."

     Not true.  In fact, Trek has made it infinitely *harder* to get
other SF on the air, including B5.  The general concensus in Hollywood is
that the market isn't big enough to sustain more than one SF show at a
time (particularly if it's space-oriented), and that's ST.  (That may only
NOW start to change with the growth of B5's ratings.)

     At every network, every studio in town, we were told -- repeatedly --
that there is NO market for space SF other than Trek, that they had the
field to themselves, and there was no interest in trying to buck that
scenario.  That's one of the reasons that PTEN was so cautious in putting
B5 on the air, among others.  Even when we got the go for series, we were
told that this was a dubious endeavor, because "we just don't think the
market can sustain more than one show like this; we'll try it, but we'll
just have to see what happens."

     So believe me, ST has not "made B5 possible."  It has been an
obstacle (one of many) to overcome.  Not just for us, but for other sF
projects that have tried to get off the ground.  And over the last few
months, we've now heard of other new SF shows gearing up in this area,
because we've shown it can be done.  And I think it's terrific; the more
shows, the more we have to compete with one another, the better the shows
will become, and the ultimate beneficiary of this is the viewer.

     Look at it this way...in the 25+ years since ST (and for the moment
leaving out Buck Rogers, about which the less said the better), how many
American SF series have there been set in the future with us as space
faring people that have lasted more than just *one* season?  Answer: zero.
 If ST had proven a market, wouldn't there be some in there?  ST has never
shown that there's a market for more SF, only that there's a market for
more ST.  B5 is the first show in over a quarter-century to play in this
particular back yard and go more than one season.

     So you'll undertstand why, when people sometimes suggest that ST made
B5 possible, the hairs on the back of my neck stand up....

them.

Subject: Re: Observations on Season Two

     I recently got a better understanding of what may have been forcing
Paramount's hand re: their struggle to get a death grip on the stations,
even at the cost of B5.  Over the weekend I had the chance to talk with
somebody WAY up the ladder in the Star Trek arena, a major name.  From
what I was told, the Paramount Network was in serious trouble of not
getting the required number of stations for some time.

     What this means is as follows: you're a national sponsor.  You want
to make sure your commercials hit a certain percentage of the population.
One of the ways to assure this is to get a certain number of TV stations
in major markets; fall below that threshold, and the sponsors drop off.
Call that figure X.  Apparently, up until a few weeks ago, Paramount had
X minus about 10.  If indeed they were pressuring stations, that would
seem to be the reason for it.  As of last week, however, apparently they
now have the correct number of stations, and all is well (which explains
why one person here on the Internet was told recently by his local
station that it *was* kind of preferred that B5 be dropped, but that this
wasn't the case anymore).

     Overall, we've lost a few stations, but nothing so substantial that
we can't find ways around it.  They've got their stations, we've got ours,
and in most cases they're the same stations.  Fair enough.

Subject: ATTN JMS: The big "E-A"

     How the EA symbol came about is really kind of interesting.  I knew
that we needed something nifty, but the preliminary designs created for
this just didn't do it for me.  So I sat down with the graphics designer,
and we started sketching stuff out.  At this point we were looking mainly
for the right silhouette.  Circle was out; oval was too soft; triangle
was too Trek.  At one point he did a star variation.  I looked at it, and
somewhere in my head the right configuration was there, so I started to
erase the points of the star, round them off, filled out the middle (and
if you've ever seen me draw, it's a scary thing; I should stick to
writing).

     I knew the shape was right when I'd finished, but I knew there was
still something missing.  That night, the designer called and said he'd
been looking at it again, and he suddenly noticed that what we'd done was
to put a silhouette E over a silhouette A, and when he sketched in the
inner horizontal bars, tucked in the corner of the feet on the A, it
came together perfectly.

     My problem is often that I can see what I want in my head, but I'm
limited on actually drawing it.  When we were doing the prosthetic design
for the pilot for Delenn, our prosthetic designer hit a wall on the
headbone section, finally threw up his hands and didn't know what to do
with the thing.  I went over to the studio, we talked for a while, I
couldn't quite communicate what was in my head, so I grabbed one of the
sticks they use to shape the clay and started re-shaping the back and
sides of the crest.  (He'd had them going straight down; I started to
curve them, and hollow them out, making them more shell-like.)  By the
time we were done, we had it worked out.

     Which is really part of the fun in doing your own series; you get to
stick your nose into parts of the production that normally you'd never get
near, and do your best to screw it up, because that's what bosses do.
I'm directly involved in costume approval, prosthetics, EFX, production
design approval, everything.  (On a couple of occasions I've sketched out
what I had in mind for costumes, much to the amusement of our costume
designer, because they look like something a 5-year old would draw.  A
drunk 5-year old, actually.  But they communicate the silhouette, and
that's the important thing, despite the fact that she's keeping the
sketches for blackmail.)

                                                                 jms

her half-human.  And yes, it would've had one hell of an impact...but my
concern when I made that decision not do do this back in the pilot was
based on the reality that we couldn't do it well.  The "male" voice,
altered by computer-enhancement, just sounded REAL bogus; we couldn't
get it right, and I had to decide between dropping it, and doing something
the people would rightly describe as lame all season, just for one big
payoff.  It was a tough call, but it had to be made.

     Nobody at the network has been messing with the show.  My general
feeling is that at the start of a new season, you're going to get a lot
of new people to the show, sampling it, and you want to bring them in
gradually.  (And as it is, there's been a LOT about the shadows in the
first batch of episodes, in "Revelations," in "The Long Dark," and in
other episodes.)

     The first seven episodes were mainly to introduce Sheridan, and to
ease in the new folks.  The next six new ones are *extremely* intense, and
get into ALL the areas you said you wanted to see, from Santiago to the
Psi Corps to the Shadow, you name it.

     I don't think a show like this can be rushed; people tend to get
impatient, which is understandable.  This show will get where it's going,
but it'll have to do so at its own pace.

     It's a funny kind of perception; I've now been at a number of cons
with the cast members, and invariably they get the questions of "How do
you create your character, how do you determine who the character is?", and
I get the overall story-arc questions...almost as if these characters had
existed outside, or were in the actors, and I stumbled upon them and put
them into this arc.

     When asked this question at LosCon, Peter Jurasik gave his usual
answer, "I just say what they write for me to say."  Which obviously is
a modest understatement; Peter breathes life into Londo and makes the
lines work.  It's all synergy, I suppose....

Subject: JMS: Pronouncing "Ivanova"

     I've known Russians who've used the same kind of pronunciation we
have given Ivanova.  It does vary.  Heck, my name is pronounced
STRUH-ZIN-SKI, when it *should* be correctly pronounced STRA-CHIN-SKI.
Both are acceptable.  And you get different pronunciations in central
Russia from places like byelorussia or the more Eastern provinces.

     If you like those kinds of character flips, you're gonna love the
next batch of episodes....

     There are some real surprises in there, some relating back to first
season stuff, and characters.

     It's easiest to flip a character when the story elsewhere is fairly
straightforward, so you lull the audience in with a sense of "okay, this
is the story, nothing major, shouldn't change anything," then you whap
them hard when they're not looking.  So whenever you see a jms script,
and there doesn't seem like there's that much to it...be careful.  The
simpler the premise -- just a visit by someone to the station, someone
taken prisoner and trying to escape -- the more you're being set up.

     It's kinda like the nak'a'leen feeder...as long as you can hear it,
you're safe...but the moment you hear nothing....

     Though Caitlin left B5 to pursue offers to star in romantic lead
parts, nothing to do with typeasting...your general concern is correct.
We've tried to help avoid that on behalf of the actors.  For instance,
visually, you can hardly recognize Peter Jurasik in makeup; ditto for
Andreas and the rest of our alien cast.  This shouldn't inhibit their
work in other areas (as opposed to seeing someone very recognizeable, but
with pointy ears, which caused Nimoy great trouble for a long time).

     In terms of the human characters, I've tried not to wrap any of them
around one specific character trait.  They range from serious to comic,
and do different things.

     Typecasting is a real concern, and it has to be addressed by those
who make the show.

that he thinks it has great promise, is constantly improving, and wishes
it only good fortune.  He even invited Doug to tea, but Doug had family

which is set in Babylon, which makes it a positive place.  [I believe,
but am willing to be corrected, that both Iran and Iraq tend to claim
Babylon for their own, though those who live there tend to feel very
independent of both sides.]  Is there much awareness of the program among
