Subject: ATTN:JMS-Improvisation:yes or

     When you're shooting a show, invariably you get to the stage and
find that you have, for instance, three lines, one per character in the
room...and you're trying to get them out the door, and it moves better
if you give one line to one character and the other two to the other
character.  That sometimes happens.  But rarely.  In the Garibaldi's yell
case, it was written as a quick shot, he yells and we're out.  The
director wanted to extend the shot a bit, visually.  I wasn't in the
studio at the time, so Jerry improvised a series of yells.
 
     This sort of thing is *extremely* rare on the show; the actors and
directors know they *cannot* change dialogue on the set without approval
from me or Larry.  On any given script, no more than about 3-6 lines get
modified for staging purposes once we get to the set.  And always with
approval required.  This is an absolute, hard and fast rule.  The only
reason the Garibaldi thing happened is that they figured it was just a
yell, so nothing could get messed up story-wise (which is the primary
reason this is so strict; change one word in a line and it could screw
up plot points three episodes down the road) by having him yell a few
specific lines.  If I'd been there for that scene, I would've written him
something a little less reminiscent of "Aliens."

Subject: The hiring of Boxleitner

     For what it's worth, Sheridan is neither a "space cowboy" nor a
"gung ho type."  This description has nothing to do with the character,
and I'm not quite sure where you got this.  Certainly I never said or
implied it.
 
     Captain John Sheridan is a war hero, of sorts; he squeaked out the
only real victory of the Earth/Minbari War.  (Which means the Minbari
don't generally like him a lot.)  He did what he did because that's his
job.  He's a professional soldier.  For the last two years, he's been
commanding the Agamemmnon, a high-visibility Earthforce starship on deep
patrol.  As such, he has had to learn to work with a number of different
races and species.
 
     In some ways, his character is somewhat more well-rounded than was
the case with Sinclair, over whom a general sense of doom often seemed to
hang.  Sheridan is often very thoughtful and introspective; at other
times, he can be just a bit eccentric; he leads by respecting those who
work under him, and giving them room to grow; like any career officer, he
HATES the bureaucracy with a passion, and this is the one thing that can
drive him nuts; he knows that commanding B5 is a great opportunity, but
he also knows that his presence brings certain complications with it, and
he's very ambivilant about that aspect; he's the son of a diplomatic envoy
who disappeared on his 21st birthday, running off to see (of all things)
the new Dali Lama being installed; he has a very easygoing manner, and a
great sense of humor.  He quickly re-forms a friendship with Ivanova, for
whom he has great respect and professional admiration.  (For a time she
served under him at Io.)
 
     He is, actually, a fascinating and intriguing character with a lot
of different shadings...none of which have *anything* to do with being a
"space cowboy" or "gung-ho type."
 
     Anyway...point being...when it was announced that there was going to
be a new Lieutenant-Commander, a number of folks went ballistic and said
the show would now be ruined.  I said, in essence, look...I created
Takashima; I can create an interesting character to replace her.  And I
thunk up Ivanova, who according to the rec.arts.b5 poll is the most
popular character on the show.  When it was announced that Sinclair would
be STAYING with the show, after the pilot, a number of folks said this
was bad, he was wooden, he stunk, get him off...and ended up being very
enamored of him.  My only reply now about Bruce...give him, and me, a
chance.  I genuinely think you will like what you see a *lot*.
 
     In the course of the first season, Ivanova, Garibaldi, G'Kar, Londo,
Delenn, others...they've exploded into strong characters.  You need an
equally strong character designed to hold his own, and be memorable, in
that august company.  Sheridan was designed knowing we had a much
elevated playing field around the character.
 
     Obviously, clearly, and irrefutably, an actor brings a *lot* to any
role.  No question.  But it tends to begin with what is created.  I've seen
it said here, repeatedly, that none of the characters are uninteresting;
they all have lives, and agendas, that make them fascinating to watch:
Londo, Morden, G'Kar, Delenn, Garibaldi, Ivanova...what those characters
are came out of my head, in terms of who they are, what they say, what they
believe, where they came from and where they're going.  Why would I invent
a new character that was any less involving, or interesting, o
multifaceted?  Particularly knowing that he's going to be a central
character?
 
     Speaking as someone who's been in fandom a long, long time, I know
there is always a tendency for panic, to assume the apocalypse is upon
us, that something is never going to be the same again.  I heard this after
the Enterprise was destroyed in "The Search for Spock."  I've heard this
a lot over the years.  It's generally over-reaction and worry before anyone
has even seen a frame of film.
 
     Bottom line being...wait and see, then judge.  I've tried very hard
not to let you down, and I think so far I haven't done so...I have no
intention of starting now.  Bruce is doing an absolutely *brilliant* job
as Captain Sheridan, bringing a thoughtfulness and intensity and
charm and intensity to the part that is a joy to behold.  Give him a
chance.
 
                                                                    jms

Subject: B5 & Violence: Light Years Awa

     I'm afraid your logic is so far from reality that I'm not sure it
can be called back.  The Suits as you call them have NOT asked for more
violence or action in the show.  In fact, as reported in the trades and
elsewhere, they have specifically asked for more character stuff and less
violence.  (Basically...we're telling the story we're telling, and we were
already starting to focus in on our characters, and we're doing more of
that in year two, but we're not sacrificing action, which I happen to
like.)
 
     Re: "...the morality of being entertained by murder and violence,"
I'm sorry, but this doesn't happen on television.  People are entertained
by *representations* or *illusions* of those elements.  No one on B5 has
ever been murdered or treated violently.  This is a fiction-based series.
There's a difference.
 
     I happen to feel strongly that the link between violence in the
streets and violence in TV/movies is hugely exaggerated by people who
think it's much easier to deal with the *picture* of the problem than it
is to deal with the *problem*.  It's simpler to censor a TV show than it
is to clean up the streets, provide jobs, properly fund schools, put more
police on the streets, provide opportunities for young kids and get the
hard drugs out of the community.
 
     Frank, if you took *every* show with even a modicum of action off
the air tomorrow...and left it off for seven days...there would not be
one less murder in South Central Los Angeles, or any of our other major
cities.  Not one.  Because television isn't the problem.  Every few
years, the trendoids and the politicos decide that comic books are the
problem, or movies are the problem, or TV is the problem...but the
reality is that the PROBLEM is the problme, not the picture of the problem.
 
     Not long ago, here in LA, a Santa Monica based anti-violence group
went out to a video store which had a big honking picture of a gun in its
front window, and picketed it.  Half a block away was a GUN SHOP.  But
they didn't picket that, they picketed the poster.  They focused on the
picture of the problem, not the problem.
 
     For me, action is a necessary component of drama.  Meaning sometimes
people get hurt.  You say, "ST expressed intelligence and humanism," and
my only reply -- and I mean no offense to the hard-core ST fans, of which
you are clearly one -- oftentimes it simply bored me to *tears*.  Nothing
was really ever at stake.  Everything was sanitized.
 
     I feel that B5 expresses just as much intelligence and humanism as
any other show, including ST.  Maybe more.  And I'll tell you why.  In
the ST:TNG universe, every human is perfect...no inner doubts, no violent
tendencies, they're *genetically engineered that way*.  That's what they
have said.  There's no quandry, no sense of questioning what should be
done, they don't have to overcome, they have already done so.
 
     So you can look at that show, and decide, "Well, I guess humanity is
doomed to be violent until we can genetically engineer ourselves to be
otherwise."  B5 humans aren't perfect.  They're flawed and scared and
tempted by violence.  They're just like us.  And though their record isn't
perfect, they frequently find ways to solve problems WITHOUT violence.  I
think this is *profoundly* more relevant and a stronger message to send,
that we can do it *today*.  We have the same problems they have, and if
they can deal with it, maybe we can.
 
     It is one thing to say, "Mankind has no further problems, no doubts,
no insecurities," and another to say, "Here are some demonstrations of
ways we can overcome our problems, doubts and insecurities."  Someone
here recently posted a message "Everything I Need To Know In Life I
Learned in Babylon 5."  I was really rather astonished to read it, because
it took all the principles we've expressed in the show, or many of them,
and put them all in one place...the capacity for self-sacrifice being one
of the principles of sentient life...that it is better to find something
worth living for than something worth dying for...on and on and on.
 
     Humanism does not mean turning a blind eye to our problems; it means
trying to elevate humanity from *inside*.  Intelligence doesn't mean we
simply assume all of our problems have been solved by genetic engineering,
which removes free will, just wipe the slate clean...it means that we need
to see alternates and means of solving problems now.
 
     Could Picard ever be tempted to do something illegal?  No.  Could
some of our characters?  Yes.  In the case of Picard, it's a no brainer.
In the case of a B5 character, we would see the struggle, the back and
forth, and maybe it would be done, maybe it wouldn't, but there would be
a REASON for it.  We see the process.  And I for one find that eminently
more interesting.
 
     Having action or make-believe violence in a show doesn't make it
any less intelligent or humanistic than any other show.  When you start
talking like that it's all kneejerk cliches and fuzzy thinking.  If it
were true, then none of Shakespeare's dramas would have survived over the
last several hundred years, and they *drip* with spilled blood.
 
     Finally, I point you to two things: 1) the original Star Trek, w here
Kirk says that yes, humans are a violent lot, we can and do kill; but we
can decide, now and then, that we will not kill *today*.  That attitude
is very much in line with B5.  So your problem isn't just with us, it's
with TOS as well.  2) I refer you to a short story by Mark Twain called
"The Man Who Corrupted Hadleyburg."  I won't tell you much more here than
to read it.  It should be self-explanatory.

Subject: Re: The Gathering did not win

     I think a large part of this debate will be determined by which
episodes fall into the right dates for eligibility.  I think that, for
instance, David Gerrold's "Believers" fell just on the other side of Hugo
eligibility for this coming year.  Which means that (if I'm correct, and
is someone could check that'd be great) only shows prior to that would be
eligible.  The only real big ones in that bunch would be "And the Sky Full
of Stars" and "Mind War."  Best bet may be to pick one of those two and
focus there.
 
     One interesting sidelight is that B5 is *very* popular in the UK,
including Scotland, so it may have a fair chance.

     (And the TNG finale isn't eligible this year, I think, having conme
(come) in after the cutoff date.)

     Bob Hoskins in "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" was talking to a cartoon
that was supposed to be a cartoon; we were never expected to accept it as
a real, live breathing creature.  We're so far doing one more major CGI
critter as an alien for year two, but the rendering power required is
absolutely MASSIVE.  (I'd also note that the budget for "Rabbit" was a LOT
more than an average B5 episode.)
 
     The problem, always, is having the alien interact with humans, not
vice-versa.  You have two choices: a human in prosthetics, or essentially
a puppet/animatronic face.  And the overall technology still isn't here
yet to do that convincingly, up close, for television.  And if you want
any real *emotion* from the character, you're going to have to have an
actor inside.

pursue it is where does one get $18 million or so per season in order to
continue filming?  And if the ratings drop, how does one convince the
stations to carry the show instead of higher rating series?
 
     The B5 series will live or die on the ratings.  Fortunately, the last
seven new episodes have continued the trend of increasing ratings, and we
just went from #20 to #18 in the overall ratings for syndication, which
is extremely good.

Subject: Re: B5 & Violence: Light Years

     "Ban guns and only criminals will have them" is one of those quick
and easy catchphrases that's used to gloss over the details of any real
problem.
 
     And the problem at hand is that the majority of murders committed in
this country are not committed by hardened (or even softened, or even
lightly par-broiled and kneaded) criminals.  They are committed by average
folks who one day get too wound up, too hot, too crazed, too frustrated,
too depressed, and pick up a gun and shoot somebody...usually a spouse,
or a competitor, or the local Post Office.  There have been cases where
the person goes out, buys the gun, comes home and starts shooting.  This
would be at least sometimes mitigated by a waiting period of a few days,
during which sometimes tempers cool, or other options besides one's own
death and the death of others become available.  (And how many times now
have we seen news of a boyfriend or husband killing wife and kids and then
turning the gun on himself?)
 
     Most murders are acts of passion...and the "criminal" line simply
doesn't wash there.  (Though certainly they're criminals *after* the
fact.)  There was a NEWSWEEK or TIME magazine piece a while back, last
year I believe, where they chronicled one week's worth of murders, and
the majority of them are crimes of passion or suicides.
 
     Yes, as you say, somebody can be killed with a baseball bat or a
knife or a rock...but then you've got to *catch* them first.  And you can
only do one at a time.  You can't spray a schoolyard with 50 teflon
coated bullets in 30 seconds with a rock.  A knife is wonderfully
inefficient.  A knife can cut and not kill, or even seriously wound you
if it doesn't go deep enough; a bullet always goes deep enough, and if it
doesn't blow through the other side, ends up bouncing around inside the
body and puncturing internal organs as much as a foot from the point of
entry.  Do that with a baseball bat.
 
     My feelings on gun and gun ownership and crime are more or less as
follows: ban assault weapons, they're good for nothing except killing other
human beings in large numbers, you don't go squirrel hunting with an
AK47...permit the ownership of rifles, shotguns, and handguns
(non-automatic), but require permits, the same way you do for fishing or
driving a car, and make sure that the person has to take X-hours of
lessons in proper gun use, the way you practice for a driver's license; if
you're going to own a gun, you should be trained to use it and use it
efficiently...if someone commits a murder with a gun of any kind, throw
the book at them.  I'm ambivilant about capital punishment, but I'm all
for life imprisonment without possibility of parole.  Put more police on
the streets and OUT OF THEIR CARS, let's see a return to community
police who are known to the folks in the neighborhood.

     In most cases, I work out the story fairly comprehensively, giving
the writer a beginning/middle/end, and some of the characters.  In a few
cases, it's less than that, a general direction and items which have to
happen in that episode.  Very often it's in writing from me, ranging from
a paragraph or two to a few pages.
 
     Generally, in TV, this would mean that I would take shared story
credit on the episode.  But there are no arbitrated credits on B5; the
freelancer gets all the credit, and all the residuals, and rightly so.

these groups, to help the network avoid accidental satanic references, and
to keep an eye on this stuff.  They gave the network execs their breakdown
of the signs that a kid was getting into satanism.  Some of them (and
this is verbatim): "He's curious.  He's sometimes sad.  He's easily
pressured by his peers.  He's into heavy metal rock and roll.  He can
sometimes be rebellious."

     By the "flip side" of stories I was referring to the other side of
events.  I.e., in episode one, Sinclair is reassigned, but we hear about
this mainly when he's away.  In the comic, we'll see where he is, and
see his reaction to what's going on.  In B-squared, we saw the present
events in the vanishment of B4; in a future episode, we'll actually see
our characters make the decision to go back in time and yank B4 forward,
what went wrong, and so on.

     Bob Hoskins in "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" was talking to a cartoon
that was supposed to be a cartoon; we were never expected to accept it as
a real, live breathing creature.  We're so far doing one more major CGI
critter as an alien for year two, but the rendering power required is
absolutely MASSIVE.  (I'd also note that the budget for "Rabbit" was a LOT
more than an average B5 episode.)

     The problem, always, is having the alien interact with humans, not
vice-versa.  You have two choices: a human in prosthetics, or essentially
a puppet/animatronic face.  And the overall technology still isn't here
yet to do that convincingly, up close, for television.  And if you want
any real *emotion* from the character, you're going to have to have an
actor inside.

Subject: # of aliens

     What you describe is already what we're doing, deciding when a new
races is better than one of our others.  Logically speaking, in a sector
of space as massive as what we're talking about, you're going to have
literally *hundreds* of worlds, possibly thousands, that have sentient
life.  (I forget now the specific number of such worlds advanced by the
Drake equation, but it's on the level of millions of such worlds in our
galaxy alone.)  You'd also have subset worlds; a world controlled by the
Centauri, for instance, whose inhabitants are not themseles Centauri, but
some other race.  (Or species, more accurately.)

     The pak'ma'ra (the carrion eaters) weren't just introduced for that
one episode ("Legacies"), they have been seen before and since, starting
with the very first episode.  Deathwalker and Varn ("Deathwalker" and
"Voice") were both the last of their kind, or close to it in the latter
case, so logically you couldn't have it be one of the previously seen
races.  So that only leaves two or three that we've brought in in the
course of a season.

     We knew that when all was said and done, we wanted a minimum of 20
or so races who would be available to us at all times, and now we've got
those.  We've just finished a 35 page breakdown of each race's history,
culture, language, politics, reproductive mechanisms and other areas for
in-house distribution.  Most alien stuff will come out of this group,
unless, again, there's a specific reason for bringing in a new one that
would compromise the story otherwise.  (For instance, the Drazi play a
role in several episodes next season.)

     We're not just throwing them in helter-skelter; we wanted to build up
a solid "repertory group" of diverse aliens, and now we've got that.

     I have always been a MAJOR fan of radio drama, and have even
written for the field (Alien Worlds, Mutual Radio Theater, others); also,
many of those whose works influenced me came out of radio (Norman Corwin,
Arch Oboler, Rod Serling).  I love dialogue, and because of the rather
intricate overall story, this is definitely an information-intensive
show, which is certainly like radio drama.  I also like trying to make
pictures out of words, which is also out of that tradition, and trying to
blend that with the visuals.

     On another level, though, Linda Ellerbee once commented that if you
could walk into another room and, listening to the TV, follow the story,
it isn't TV, it's radio.  TV should take fullest advantage of the visual
medium, and that's something that I'm working more on this season, now
that we've established the core of the B5 universe over the first
season, and the information required for that.  More and more scenes
without dialogue, or a minimum of dialogue, to balance it all out.  It's
really a learning process, every day.  I've written over 125 produced
episodes of TV, for some of the highest rated shows around...and I still

Subject: Why does B5 exist?

     B1-3 were sabotaged very early into production, so the cost was less
than the inconvenience.  B4 was where they dumped all the money, and it
was very iffy if there'd be a 5, until the Minbari came up to the plate
and offered to help finance it.  For Earth, which was almost wiped out in
the war, it's more a matter of self-preservation.

Subject: JMS: Questions about the B5 un

     I've always said that there's a side story that could follow the 5
year B5 storyline, which takes place in the B5 universe, and follows on
the heels of the events in B5...but who knows if that would happen?

     The one thing I would hate is for B5 to become any kind of so-called
"franchise."  Because as soon as that happens, you're prevented from making
any changes, from doing anything that might startle people, cutting into
the piggy-bank.  Once that happens, you're dead.

     I've also made no secret of my sense that, should B5 run its full
five year course (and assuming the side-story doesn't go, which I would
not exactly count on)...I plan to get out of TV.  By that point, I would
have said pretty much everything I want to say in TV, and it's time to
get out, buy a small house somewhere outside London, and spend the rest
of my years writing novels, which is kinda where this all began.  (I've
had 2 novels, 1 anthology, and a bunch of short stories published, as
well as 500 or so articles.)

     I never got into this to make a ***FRANCHISE***, and never really
intended to become an executive producer.  I just don't like being
rewritten...so I climbed higher, until finally there was nobody over me
messing with my scripts.  Outside of the B5 reality, if someone came to
me and offered me *staff writer* on a show -- the lowest position in the
TV totem pole -- but with the guarantee that I wouldn't be rewritten, they
wouldn't change the words...I'd take it in a hot second.  I'm here, now,
strictly out of self-defense.

     Two valuable social skills are knowing when to enter a room, and when
to leave a room.  At some point, you have to get out or become something
you don't want to become.  I've never really been part of the Hollywood
SYSTEM, and have no desire to do so.

     In "The Velvet Alley," Rod Serling wrote of a young advertising writer
who becomes a success at writing television.  At one point, the character
says (paraphrased from memory): "Here's the trap...in TV they pay you lots
of money for what you do...then, slowly, your standard of living rises
until you *need* that constant flow to stay at that level.  Then...they
threaten to take it away from you if you don't behave.  And THAT'S when
they've got you."

                                                                    jms

Subject: Re: B5 & DS9: Off to War

     The working name for the sixth race is the Shadowmen.

     And, as you note, one of things that I like to play with is the
layering of ambiguity.  Let's say, just for the sake of argument, that
we set up two sides: Shadowmen vs. Vorlons, which looks like evil vs.
good.  Fundamentally, I would find that boring.  What you would then have
to do is get into WHY they're doing what they do, and HOW they're doing
what they do.

     There is, for instance, the "good" that says, "We know what's best
for you, we'll protect you, nurture you, but you'll do it our way, and
we'll keep you away from ideas and beliefs you shouldn't be exposed to."
Okay, maybe that fits one definition of good...but is it?

     On the flip side, for instance, there's the "bad" that says "There
must be conflict and death, because it's only through conflict and death
that we grow stronger, that we can eventually create an ordered
universe.  The gene pool must be kept strong.  To do that, there must be
war and strife and death."  Okay, maybe that fits the definition of evil,
but is it?

     The key, again and always, is that nothing is what it seems on
Babylon 5.  And even if it looks like it IS what it is, you have to look
at WHY it is what it is...and maybe at that point it isn't.

     One of the things about this show is that you see as much as you're
willing to see.  You can gloss over it, say, "Okay, these are the good
guys, these are the bad guys."  But the closer you look, the more you see
the shades.  I imagine when the Shadowmen are more fully revealed, some
folks'll think we're going for a basic good/evil conflict...but believe
me, there's a hell of a lot more involved in it than that.

                                                                       jms
