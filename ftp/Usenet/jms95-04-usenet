give back to those involved.

     That particular image is very striking, and I think part of that comes

something that just *gets* to you on a very subconscious, almost cellular

     David: you hit it *exactly* on the head.  Again, as you point out,
stuff here operates on a lot of different levels.  I try, where I can, to
make a given scene do more than one thing.  The hall argument is a good
example of this.  The script stipulated a human being stuck between G'Kar
and Londo.  Not any other race.  Had to be a human.  Because that becomes
emblematic of how we're stuck between the two sides in the war, something
which is *very* strongly brought home in the next batch of episodes.
 
     Obviously, the first most important thing in that scene is just the
gag, the humor.  It has to work on that level, and that's how it came to
me first: just the gag.  Then, when it came time to write it, that's when
I start poking at things to see if I can layer on another level of
meaning, and I saw a way to do a little (very little) visual foreshadowing
of stuff to come.  Didn't matter if anybody ever noticed it or not; it
was never really intended to be of much note, just a little item that
becomes a nice bit of irony later.

good on one level, on several actually...but the problem you run into is
when you then have to bring in guests from overseas.  Traveling from the

the smaller fan-run cons can't afford to do that in general, or for only
one person; a profit con really represents the only chance most people will
ever have to see several people from a given show, though Wolf 359 is doing
a bit more in that area.

     As it happens, I've had occasion to have several long talks with the
Babcom organizers, and have nudged them more in the direction of doing more
of the things one might expect at a fan-con: more interaction, more
personalization, breaking down the walls a bit.  Some of the things now
under discussion: a more relaxed social situation, close to an ice cream
social sort of thing, so it isn't all just a presentation; a personal
Q&A session about breaking into TV; Peter has spoken to them about letting
folks watch as the Optic Nerve people make him up into Londo; and others.
Again, these are still in the conversation stage, but my sense to try and
encourage them toward a more personalized and fan-responsive format.

eminently silly.  If I do not believe in green penguins at the north pole,
am I now a believer in non-green-penguinism?  If I were to sit down and

now beliefs, and there are an infinite number of beliefs because there are
potentially an infinite number of things I don't believe in, and I'm not
sure I can sustain that many beliefs without imploding.

     If I say to you, "Did you lock the car door when you parked it?" and
you say, "I believe so," is that a belief that is equal to, say, the
tenets of Judaism?  Is that equal to the theses Martin Luther nailed to
the church door?  Are you now a believer in Locked-Doorism?
 
     If you define any belief as reliion, then you diminish and
trivialize religion.  (Oops, typo above.)  Words mean what they mean, not
what we want them to mean when it is convenient for us.  The Oxford
American Dictionary defines religion as "belief in the existence of a
superhuman power, especially of gods or gods, usually expressed in
worship; a particular system of faith and worship."
 
     "Belief" is not the key word in the preceding sentence; it's the
phrase "belief IN the EXISTENCE of a superhuman power."  It's what the
belief is IN.  If it does not contain the belief IN the existence of a
superhuman power/god, then it is NOT religion.  Period.
 
     This is just one more offshoot of the whole (and boy, do I hate to
even mention this) evolution/creation thing, where schools said, "No, we
cannot teach creation, we teach science, not religion."  So the
creationists decided to come back with "Oh, but evolution IS a religion,
so why them and not us, huh?  Huh?"  It's an attempt to redefine terms
for advantage.

     If the question is "Which is the greater good, self sacrifice or
honesty within the B5 universe," I'd have to for a third option.  Both
of those are behaviors in service to a given cause.  And it's the
selection of the greater *cause* that is most important; is it a
constructive cause, or a destructive one?  Are you helping humanity step
forward, or step back?  This isn't situational ethics, because the ethics
going in have to be the same: building the future, helping those who
cannot help themselves, spreading hope, fighting repression and pushing
for freedom and responsibility as linked concepts.
 
     Our characters in B5 are flawed; sometimes they fall short of their
own goals.  The Minbari don't generally lie; but the often tell only part
of the truth.  If G'Kar has gotten away with something in the pilot, and
can't be brought to standard justice, some other way of meting out
justice will be found, even if that means fibbing to him about a
transmitter he's swallowed...i.e., lying.
 
     But even Sinclair said it: everybody lies.  Everybody means
everybody.  Even if it's only a case of, "Listen, I tried to make it to
the party, but traffic was just a mess, I got up late, the dog ate my
homework."
 
     I make some distinction between this and my own personal view; the
work of the author does not always represent what the author believes on
a 1-1 basis.  (If it did, there'd be NO religion in B5.)  Personally, I
think I put loyalty and honesty at the top of my pantheon.  I've worked
very hard to maintain a certain reputation, and it means a lot to me.
And anyone here who knows me knows that if you try and go after someone
I consider a friend, you will have to go through me first.
 
     The problem with putting self-sacrifice at the tippy top of your
own personal Maslow's Pyramid of Self-Actualization is that it only
functions as a subset of something else.  Self-sacrifice...to do *what*?
You are willing to die for a cause.  Is that cause right?  Are you too
easily and readily prepared to sacrifice?  The other, less terminal form
of self-sacrifice is giving to other people, working to make life better,
but I don't tend to believe that's sacrifice as much as simple personal
responsibility.  We should do it as freely and as easily as we breathe.

     Babylonian Productions does not skimp or hold back money for

Period.  Warner Bros. Publicity handles all PR for Babylon 5; we have
zero control over that area, but a little influence, that's all.
 
     Nor can we simply decide, out of the blue, to produce a 23rd episode
of the show.  Warners and the stations making up PTEN make an executive
decision on the pickup and number of episodes.  It is not within our
purview to violate that.  Further, that would mean coming in under budget
over the season in an amount equal to the price of one episode, which we
have never done, and never will.  Each season, we come in just a smidge
under budget.  And I do mean just a *smidge*.  Pocket change, compared to
the overall cost of the show.
 
     The small under-budget from year one was invested into new sets and
costumes and to get a leg-up on CGI for year two.  The small year two
underage will likely be put toward the production on year three, assuming
we're renewed.  Neither Doug nor I take a dime of that.  Recently, Warners
did a spot audit, as they do for any series.  They showed up at 9 a.m.,
saying they'd be here for a few days.  A few hours later, they said they
might be able to finish by the end of the day.  By lunchtime, they were
finished, and said that this was the best set of books they'd ever seen.
 
     So the line about maybe someday putting the profits back into the
series, we've been doing that since day one, insofar as the under-budget.
As for profits...there aren't any that we get.  Our contract with WB
gives us a percentage of the NET.  Now, anyone who works in Hollywood
knows there's no such thing as net profit.  It takes a VERY long time for
a TV series to ever show anything.  Once the series is finished, and no
more shows are being produced, and the series enters long-term syndication,
lessening the expenditures, then there may finally be some small profit,
but at that point the show's done.

Subject: "Casting Couch"
Date: 14 Apr 1995 01:12:20 -0400

     We're very fortunate in that the casting couch has been less of a
problem in the Industry over the last ten-twenty years than it has been
in the past.  The CC was most in play when studios were run by one or two
individuals who could dictate to their producers and directors who to use
in a movie.  Over time, as power within studios and networks got more
widely spread among other executives, directors, producers, you name it,
there isn't any one person any longer who has that clout.  Does it still
go on?  I believe it does, at a much reduced level, and mainly in the
film arena, where again there's more individual discretion.
 
     That kind of discretion is less readily present in TV, so there isn't
the power to fuel the temptation.  For instance, on B5, our casting
sessions include: casting director Mary Jo Slater, me, Doug Netter, John
Copeland, Larry (if it's his episode, otherwise not), the director of
that episode, a reader to work opposite the actor, and sometimes, if the
role is crucial opposite a regular performer, that performer is there.
That's as many as 8 people, as opposed to one big studio guy sitting behind
a desk, smoking a stogie and eyeing whoever's opposite him.

     There is a difference between saying, "I believe there is no god,"
and "I do not have within me the belief in the existence of a god."  The
latter is not a belief in, or about, any kind of power; it is the total
absence of belief.  You cannot turn that into a religion, no matter how
many times you repeat your thesis.

Subject: JMS: How are we doing?
Date: 15 Apr 1995 03:07:24 -0400

     I'd say that overall the nets, collectively, have done very good at
picking up on what's going on in the show.  I think the larger themes have
been missed in places, but I think that in many ways that's because the
larger pieces haven't yet been inserted into the jigsaw puzzle so that
others can see what's going on.
 
     The greatest errors, I think, come in looking too closely for
parallels to other fiction.  "Oh, I get it, it's just like X."  That line
will lead you only into error.
 
     In any work of fiction, there are two primary elements: theme and
plot.  Plot are the incidents, theme is what it's *about* on a very
core level.  Plot has been well analyzed; themes not necessarily.  To tie
this paragraph and the one preceding, for instance, a number of folks
considered that the events in "Acts of Sacrifice" with the Lumati were a
shot at the Prime Directive/non-interference.
 
     Nothing could have been further from the truth, and it wasn't until
this was mentioned here that it even occured to me.  Take a look at
Washington DC these days, and the larger culture.  People being
warehoused, other people who *should* be in homes shoved out onto the
streets to fend for themselves, a general callousness that seems to be
creeping into the bones of a society that was born on the premise that
we should be at minimum kind to one another.  I figured that one would
get a lot of discussion going on the degree to which society is, or should
be responsive to the least of its citizens.  Darwinism vs. charity.  And
some of that did emerge.  But a fair measure of it got siphoned off into
comparisons with ST.
 
     That, however, is really the exception rather than the rule.  I very
frequently find myself surprised at the depth of analysis that goes on
here, and the toughtfulness behind it.  Quite a few have Gotten It.  Some
are still backing up far enough to see the whole picture.  And maybe at
times I'm not being sufficiently craftworthy in my work to make those
elements sufficiently clear.  But the deeper we go, the more there is to
get, and the more folks *do* seem to be nailing it.
 
                                                                 jms

     About the new paper and price...I did the first issue, and while the

the paper just absorbed the hell out of it and it looked like crap, from

Parts were nice, but other parts...yikes.  I felt, strongly, that we
needed a better quality of paper, otherwise a lot of the good work that
was being done was going to be lost.  It would cost more, but finally DC
-- which, to be fair, has only been VASTLY supportive of B5, and the comic
and their only intention is to make it as good as possible -- decided to
go with the better quality paper.  The main question was whether or not
there was enough of a reader base to warrant it; there was, and they did.
 
     I've overall been quite happy with how the book is being handled.

Subject: Notes from jms
Date: 15 Apr 1995 04:04:58 -0400

     Just some quick random thoughts....
 
     For those who've been nudging other folks to try out B5, you may want
to tell them that this coming batch of eps is probably the best time to
dive in.  In particular, our second new show (airing the first week of
May) is designed in part to help new viewers coming to the show to catch
up on background.  (No, not a clip show, or anything like that...I think
you'll like it.)  I also *strongly* recommend that you videotape this
episode, entitled "And Now For a Word."  There's something in there just
(or primarily) for the videotapers.  Consider this a heads-up from the
inside.  You'll know what it is when you sorta see it.)
 
     For those who've asked...yes, I'll be doing another cycle of the B5
comic, a 4-issue arc that'll probably hit the newsstands about the time
our second season (PTEN willing) goes on the air.  I've decided that tat
(at) this stage it'll follow a Ranger, bringing us into contact with lots
of different parts of the B5 universe, and may also use it as a kind of
bridge between seasons 2 and 3.
 
     We should know officially about the fate of our third season by the
end of this month.  We continue to be cautiously optimistic.
 
     For all the bitching I've done about Creation, I have to say that
I'm very pleased by something that just came through my office for
approval: a B5 jacket with the silhouette of the station embroidered on
the back, and the B5 symbol in front.  It's *very* nicely done.
 
     The B5 trading cards, originally to come from Cardz, will now be
coming out from Fleer, and I'm actually quite pleased by that, since I
really like a lot of the work Fleer has done on their comics-related
stuff.
 
     Unrelated to B5: I just picked up the laserdisk for the letterboxed
version of "The Haunting (of Hill House)" and it's amazing.  I've never
seen it in that format, only the version altered for conventional TV
aspect ratio.  There's stuff going on in the edges of this film that are
brilliant.  Just seeing ALL of Hill House, vast against the night, rather
than the one dark clump in the center of the frame, is worth the price of
admission.  (An example: just as the lead character stands in the hallway,
thinking aloud that the house seems to be reaching for her, you see in the
letterbox a spider-plant just past her shoulder that does indeed, from the
way its' shot, seem to be grasping at her, something you can't see in the
regular version.)  The film is *full* of stuff like this, and I feel as
though I've seen the movie for the first time, even though I've watched
the prior version literally dozens of times.  (Yes, along with "Seconds,"
it's one of my favorite films.)
 
     If you have a laserdisk player, pick this one up.  It's nifty.
 
     On Monday we begin our last week of filming.  We're going for an
eight-day shoot this one time, rather than our usual seven-day shoot,
because of the extraordinary EFX requirements to pull off the finale.  It
should be a doozy.

     "Who gets the fees and royalties from Babylon 5 licensed
merchandise?"
 
     Warner Bros.  This income is cross-collatoralized against costs of
production and distribution in determining net profit.  Translation: no
net profit.  I do not get a creator's fee from the comic or the novels.
All income goes to Warners, which then puts it against costs.
 
     "Who gets the fees from personal appearances?"  The person making
the appearance.  I do not get any money from actors' appearances.  I do
get small fees for my own apperances, but the problem is that because of
my height, I generally need to fly first.  Most cons can afford to pay
for either coach or business.  So I make up the difference, which in many
cases means I end up either breaking even, or losing a bit.
 
     "Who gets the royalties from Babylon 5 publications?"  Warner Bros.
See above.
 
     "Are these fees and royalties plowed back into the series
production?"  No.  Warners collects those fees and puts them into an
account marked INCOME.  Costs associated with the creation of the show are
marked DEBITS.  The job of ALL of the studios is to make sure that, on
paper, the INCOME never gets higher than the DEBITS line.
 
     Re: the production costs...we tell Warners what we think it will cost
to make the show at its best level.  That is what they give us.  And that
is what we use to make the show.
 
     This is how all TV shows work, particularly at the syndication level.
Hugely rated network shows can use the leverage to re-negotiate and change
the profit formula slightly to redefine "net" and remove such things as
distribution fees and the like.  That's not the case with B5.
 
     And now for the one personal observation...you have now hit a new low,
Theron.  You can't find anything else to attack, your claims are consistent
bullshit, so now you start throwing around the suspicion that maybe someone
(viz: me) is making huge amounts of profit on B5 and short-shrifting the
production.

You're confounded by the fact that somehow they don't quite seem to fit

     Yes, what I said was what I intended.  Do the studios profit from
their series/movies?  Of course.  But many of the contracts with their
people -- actors, writers, producers, directors -- stipulate that they get
a piece of any net profit.  Consequently, the studios do all they can to
make sure that *on paper* it looks as if they've never had a profit.
 
     There have been many cases of stars who, twenty years after their
shows entered syndication, asked where the heck their profit is, and were
told that the show is still in the red.  Does anyone believe this?  Of
course not.  But getting into their books for audits is hard; ask Art
Buchwald.

Subject: JMS: What would you have done
Date: 20 Apr 1995 06:50:05 -0400

     If we'd only had models to work with, then we would've found some way
to make the models work.  I think a lot of the difficulty with TV EFX is
just not thinking things through, and doing everything last-minute.  We
don't generally have that problem.
 
     One of the options we discussed at the time was shooting model EFX
sequences in a slightly different way.  Because I know the story for each
year ahead of time, we could've ganged all the EFX shots together.  I.e.,
you know you're going to have battle scenes in episodes 3 and 7 between
the same two races, same kinds of ships.  So you double up your cameras
for different angles, and basically shoot both at once, then isolate the
different pieces for either of the two episodes.  We also would've had a
second unit shooting 2 days per week as a visual EFX unit.
 
     Either way, it would've been done.  We're quite happy that CGI came
along when it did, but we would've found some way to do it regardless.
The history of this series is that of determination despite whatever
obstacles are thrown at us.  Once we set our minds to the course, nothing
stops us.
 
     Patience, determination, direction and strength.

     Actually, to correct this, the last track in the European version
has more *perussion* and fewer strings, whereas the American version has
more strings and less percussion (this in the longer, reorchestrated
suite of the Requiem for the Line).  This was because Chris sent me the
tape with the last track for my approval.  I listened to it, and thought
it was great...but for me, what really makes the RftL theme so beautiful
and moving and tragic and powerful are the strings in counterpoint to the
rest of the rhythm.  Here they were missing.  So I called, and said, "It
really needs the strings."  By this point they were already pressing the
European edition, and it was too late to do anything about it.  It was
subsequently revised for the American release.  So now there are two
versions floating around out there; the percussive version is nice for
the driving aspect of it, it hits you hard in the gut; the string version
hits you in the heart and breaks it.

we've had with them, because it was learned subsequent to the initial
decision not to take part in it that many folks had bought non-refundable
airline tickets, and may not get ticket refunds.  They're determined not
to see the fans burned by this.  Babylonian Productions, Warners nor I can
endorse or support the con in any way; we've been burned enough.  Thus I
can't go.  But I must commend our cast for rising above the problems
presented to us at the other end, and risking more problems by taking part.

out okay.  Suffice to say we're going to be watching *very* carefully.

to wonder if I could apply this exercise, in a limited way, to an episode
of the show.  I can't say more than that without spoiling things, but
suffice to say you learn a lot about all kinds of people, and the way you
learn it says a lot about those involved.  It's a *very* subversive and
tricky episode, and I *very* much suggest taping it, so you can go back

     I do not hold the copyright for B5.  The copyright for ALL shows is
in the hands of the studios.  Roddenberry, for instance, did not own (and
his estate does not own) Star Trek.  Paramount does.  Look at any of the
ST merchandise: (c) (year) Paramount Television.  Warner Bros./PTEN holds
the copyright for B5.
 
     Thus, if they license it to a comics company, it's between the company
and the "creator" for legal purposes...Warner Bros.  Ditto for the novels.
Why do I thus get involved anyway?  Because they're based on my show, and
I have a personal interest in making sure they're done right.
 
     And as stated, the goal is to keep income below debits *on paper*,
not in reality.

     You have to understand in all this that the studios agenda is always
to guarantee maximum return for the studio and its stockholders, and the
minimum or nothing for those who create the product.  This is the modus
operandi for *all* studios.
 
     Example: I worked on MURDER, SHE WROTE as a writer/producer for two
years.  It's a highly-rated top ten network series.  The shows air two or
three times on network, then are taken off.  Such programs usually go into
syndication, where the studio receives a per-episode fee from the
syndicator.  In syndication, you get a straight residual, which for a
third/fourth run (now the first syndicated run) would be a couple/three
grand.  Not bad.
 
     But more and more, shows like M,SW are sold to *cable* like USA
Network, where the formula is different.  There you, the writer, get a
percentage of the gross price paid per episode by the cable network.
Okay, so far so good, right?  Except one day, some smart executive at
Universal realized that the studio is also part owner of USA Network, and
that by selling the episodes at market price, they were charging
themselves an arm and a leg.  So why not charge the *bare minimum* to
themselves, and sell the show cheap to their own branch?  So a show that
would normally be sold to another cable network for, say, a couple
hundred grand, one time, they turn around and sell instead to a cable
network they own, where it can run indefinitely, and sell it for a couple
hundred dollars...knowing full well that all the talent involved get a
percentage of the purchase fee.
 
     Result: the third/fourth run of one of my M,SW episodes (the first
on USA) which, anywhere else, would bring in 2 or 3 grand brings in a
grand total of....$28.
 
     You know that old joke about the (ethnic group) actress who was so
dumb she slept with the writer?  There's a reason...because she'd heard
that in LA, *everyone* screws the writer.
 
                                                                  jms

     Bear in mind you're comparing apples and oranges.  The top 20 shows
in syndication include mainly game shows and talk shows.  You have to do
what the studios do, and separate out the dramas from the rest of the
pack.  And among dramas we do *very* well, particularly in our
demographics.

Subject: ATTN JMS: "Watch it cold"
Date: 22 Apr 1995 01:30:33 -0400

     If there were three episodes I'd say should be watched as cold as
possible, I'd say..."In the Shadow of Z'ha'dum," "The Fall of Night,"
and "The Long, Twilight Struggle."  (To some extent, I'd also inclulde
[include] "Confessions and Lamentations," and "Divided Loyalties.")
 
     Unfortunately, that's the bulk of the remaining episodes, as opposed
to CoS, which was a one-off situation.  Hell, in some ways, when compared
with "Struggle," "The Coming of Shadows" is a light comedy in which nothing
much happens.
 
     Remember, the deeper we go into the story, the more we're going to
start cranking things.  Each new batch starts off with a lighter, "let's
get acquainted" episode, but they turn fast.  So I don't know what can
really be done about spoilers and stuff, except to hope for the best.
 
     "Confessions" isn't per se a wham episode, for instance, but it does
have some very sharp turns, and it's an extremely intense episode on a
par with "Believers."  It makes no compromises and takes no prisoners, and
I imagine it'll stir up about as much debate as did "Believers," if not
more.  When we did playback after doing the audio mix a few days ago,
there wasn't a dry eye in the house.

     For track 12, Christopher did a much longer, full-length version of
The Battle of the Line sequence, adding a lot of depth and letting it play
out fully.  So yes, parts of it echo what's on the disk earlier, but in a
better, extended-play version.  For me, it's one of the best tracks on the
disk (though I somewhat prefer the American version over the European
version, due to the strings).

Subject: Attn. JMS: Larry DiTillio no l
Date: 23 Apr 1995 05:42:42 -0400

     The information is essentially correct.  This year, I wrote 15 out
of 22 episodes.  Larry provided an additional 3.  That leaves 4 freelance
scripts, and in all four of those cases, I did pretty much all of the
rewriting on them.  Consequently, Larry spent a lot of his time more or
less cooling his heels.  There really wasn't that much for him to do.
Next season, I'll probably write 17 or 18, so again, there's not really
enough for a story editor to *do*.  A story editor rewrites.
 
     Also, this is the kind of show where I've set the parameters from day
one (actually from 1987), and Larry's strength is in world-building and
determining the direction of a show.  There isn't much room for that.  So
overall, it seemed to make sense to free him up to go after shows where he
can have more influence, do more rewrites and more original scripts; let
him make his mark.  He has great strenths in areas not being utilized,
particularly as a script doctor.  And there are several very interesting
opportunities out there for him.
 
     So while we're still allocating a budget for a story editor for next
season, just in case I get swamped, right now there are no plans for any
one new in that position.  It's just not something that fits into the
unusual way that B5 operates, we've found.  (A story editor also works in
generating stories or listening to pitches...and, again, those are all
pretty much worked out ahead of time; all but one of the freelance scripts
this season were based on assigned premises from me, based on my notes for
this season).  Look for him soon in other projects where he can mold the
direction in interesting and unique areas.

     The pak'ma'ra are indeed tech scavengers; the tentacles move (we do

it into the mouth cavity; their "teeth" are more like beaks in structure;
their whole culture is based on the notion that they're basically
superior to everyone else, which is why they eat carrion in part, to
demonstrate their superiority over all others (they don't eat their own
kind); they do breathe oxygen, but because of the shape of their mouths,
cannot form human words, and thus rely on translation devices.

     Unfortunately, because of the demands of making B5, I don't generally
get to watch a lot of TV.  I try to catch the X-Files whenever I can, and
I'd have to say that's probably my personal favorite of what's out there
right now.  (Fittingly, in my office, I don't have a B5 cup on my desk, I
have an X-Files mug.)  I like MST3K enormously, and we had kind of an
exchange program going; they sent me a picture personally autographed by
all the main guys on the show, and we sent them a bunch of B5 caps.  They
mentioned our show recently on their series, and now I have to find some
way to repay the favor.
 
     I've only seen a couple of VR5's and am thus far having a hard time
getting into it.  That may change with more viewings.  I gave up on Earth 2
and SeaQuest some time ago, though some folks have been trying to get me
to take another look on E2, saying it's improved, so I'll try to give it
another shot when I get some free time.
 
     My favorite shows generally tend to be ones from a while back, like
the Prisoner, the original Star Trek, Outer Limits, Thriller, Twilight
Zone, Blake's 7 and a few others.

     On my office wall I have two large areas set aside for quotes, wh ich
are on 2x3 placards.  I switch them in and out depending on my mood and the
situation.  (Up now are "The point of no return.  That is the point which
must be reached."  And "To define is to kill.  To suggest is to create."
All the quotes are about writing in one way or another.)
 
     Another of them, which will get its turn shortly, is "Writers are not
necessarily corrupted by money.  Rather they are distracted, detoured into
other venues."
 
     I don't wanna be distracted.  Making TV and telling stories is hard
enough without adding an extra layer of nonsense.  I make a good living.
I agree to license the stuff I'd personally like to have.  But money has
never really *meant* that much to me, except the freedom to write what I
want, when I want, whenever I want.  When I left Murder, She Wrote to do
B5, I took a pay cut even though the position was higher.  My agent said
I was nuts.  That's fine.  Most of the jobs I've had, in the end I've
walked off, despite people waving money, when I thought that I could no
longer tell the stories I wanted to tell.
 
     After a season on CAPTAIN POWER, when I wrote pretty much anything I
wanted, I got the sense that the second season was going to be more in the
control of the sponsor.  They put a deal on the table for year two; I had
no other options waiting.  Nonetheless, I passed.  When I was on Jake and
the Fatman, the company screwed over my exec producers, to whom I owed a
great deal of allegiance.  When they quit, I also walked, even though this
was my first major network staff credit, and I had nothing else pending,
and in fact ended up not working for several months.
 
     Point being...nothing *really* matters to me but telling a story, and
being free to tell it the way I want.  And if I got into heavily trying to
exploit every single dime out of B5, approving anything and everything,
softened where the show was going to help it get lots of spinoffs....it
wouldn't be the story I want to tell anymore.  A good part of what this
show is, is subversive, and some elements are a bit on the controversial
side.  If I had my eye on the dollar, I'd've never put "Believers" into
production.  Or "Confessions and Lamentations" this season.
 
     Also, I'm 40.  I'll be 41 in July.  If B5 goes its full 5 year run,
I'll be 44/45 at the end.  And I will have said pretty much everything I
want to say in TV.  At 45, I'll probably have 20 years in me to write all
the novels I want to write before the game is called on account of
darkness.  I really don't want to waste that time running a franchise when
I should be telling stories.  You find your story, you get on the stage,
tell it and get the hell off the stage.
 
     Finally, I'm leery of money past a certain point.  Rod Serling wrote,
in "The Velvet Alley," "Here's how they get you: they bring you to
Hollywood, and they pay you vast amounts of money for what you write.
Slowly, your standard of living begins to rise to where now you NEED that
income every day to maintain it.  And then they threaten to take it away
from you...and then they own you."
 
     'Nuff said.

     A gunsight from the POV of the shooter.

     The problem is that if you have Ivanova constantly threatening people,
it gets real old real fast, and after a while loses any real menace or
threat.  So you use it sparingly.  Otherwise it swiftly lapses into cliche.

Subject: JMS in the UK this weekend

     For those in the UK, Claudia Christian, Peter Jurasik and I will be
swooping in for Babcom 95, held this weekend (the 29th and 30th) in
Birmingham at the National Exhibition Center.  This will be a more fan
friendly convention than is usually the case at event-style conventions.
 
     We hear tickets are going fast, so if you're doing to go, best to
look into it.
