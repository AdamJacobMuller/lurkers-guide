Subject: new psi corps novel out

Just for those who haven't heard yet, the newest B5 novel -- first in a trilogy
of books about the origins of the Psi Corps through and beyond the events of
the fifth season -- is out.  "Dark Genesis," by J. Gregory Keyes, from a jms
outline.  For my money, this is probably one of the best B5 novels ever done,
and it takes quite a risk, because even though you see ancestors of some of our
characters (the books cover about 80 years), there are none of the regulars in
it.  It's our first attempt to really flesh out the B5 universe and future
history.  

Anyway, it's a hell of a read, and I commend it to you without reservation.

Subject: Re: ATTN: JMS - B5 LaserDisc Commentary

Apparently Image has now confirmed with WB that the widescreen versions do
indeed exist, so that's good...on the other hand, they were produced in PAL
format for overseas, and it costs a few pennies here and there to convert them
to NTSC standard for American use, and WB is wondering if it's worth the time
and effort to do so.

So a bunch of emails to Image encouraging them to continue to press on this
issue might have some weight....

And yes, we've discussed adding further material, such as commentaries,
bloopers, lost scenes, whatever.

I'm fine with it, though each show should be allowed to find its own identity,
it shouldn't have to feel (nor should its viewers have to feel) it must be
compared with B5.  

That we've been able to create a new paradigm in SF TV is a niceness, and the
notice is welcome and long-overdue.

Subject: Re: The death of ISN


Understand that video clips fall under the aegis of the various Guilds: screen
actors guild, directors guild, writers guild, others.  Even *we* can't take,
digitize, and put up digital clips of shows at ANY length on thestation.com. 
This has nothing to do with anything other than the fact that this is not
allowable by anyone, for any reason, other than WB itself.  To allow even a 10
second clip on a TV talk show, there have to be waivers (usually automatically
given) by the guilds; it's a contractual issue that supercedes anything and
everything else.

Attempts to broaden this out to anything else are invalid because everyone else
is being left alone, because nobody else is doing this.  The policy stands.

The TNT memo was apparently real, from within the network to others in the
network.  But the egregious points have gone away.  

Not only that, but they've allocated a huge chunk of change for us to upgrade
sets and add a bunch of new sets to the series, stuff we'd been planning to do
later, but can do now instead.

Subject: sleeping in light suggestion


I was watching "Sleeping in Light" again today (I have a tendency to run the
last ten minutes plus the credits over and over...to see if it'll stop getting
to me, and so far it hasn't), and had some thoughts on it for folks out there. 

People often ask if there's anything they can do in return for B5, something
I'd like and I do have some ideas, here at the end, regarding SiL.

I think it would be a wonderful thing if more folks than usual got together for
viewing parties on this one.  Not newcomers, not folks who haven't seen the
show, just the "family," if you will.  If B5 has helped to create communities,
then I think this last episode should be for that community.

I also think you'll find some interesting tie-offs in this show...something
about Minbari beliefs about souls born in the hearts of suns, and a pay-off to
why the narrations of this series have always been in the past tense, and a
gift to the crew of this show...to which end I *strongly* suggest that even if
you don't normally tape this series, that you do tape *this* episode so you can
go back and check some stuff at the end.

"Sleeping in Light" airs in just a little over two months, and every time I
look at it, it has the sense of something very special coming to its
conclusion.  It's so damned hard watching it...and yet there's something about
it that is massively uplifting at the same time.

Anyway, I was just thinking that often viewing parties are used to bring in new
folks to B5, but this one, I think, should be for the family.  Maybe local fan
groups want to get together, find someone with a good-sized TV, and watch. 
It's one of those Moments, I think, that will be remembered a long time
thereafter.

And I've got TNT's promise not to run a voice-over or squish the credits at the
end.

I think my outlines for each of the Psi Corps novels was about ten pages each. 
It spelled out the broad strokes of what happened in each one of them, and left
Gregory to fill in the gaps and work out the details in conjunction with myself
and our reference editor, so that all the timelines jived and everything made
canonical sense.

It's probably encouraged some reconsideration of their security measures.

Huh? (blinking) B-but you're making it sound as if Styrofoam ISN'T
supposed to be eaten!

What do I do with all these packing peanuts and clam dip?

Guess I'll have to call the family and tell 'em to stay home. Party's

I have to say that from context alone, one can NEVER tell for sure what
Earthers consider to be food! Hph!

Peter is superb as Galen, utterly brilliant.  I think we lucked into a
character and an actor that is going to be extremely popular with fans.  I
couldn't be happier with his work to date; I'd put his work up there with Peter
Jurasik and Andreas Katsulas, easily.

I lived in San Diego a few times, the last being from about 1974 to 1981.  I
actually rather enjoyed living there (I went to and graduated from San Diego
State during that time).  I cut my teeth as a journalist there, and got my
first stage credits.  I felt that the town was a little too provincial, and
still is a bit, but would've stayed if what I wanted to do could be done there,
but living in LA is necessary to work in TV.  Figures that they'd upgrade the
place just after I left....

Subject: Re: ATTN: JMS - production halted?


Yeah, actually I mentioned this in passing a couple of days ago on
Compuserve...wasn't that big a deal, but to recap for here:

In addition to the Christmas break, we have always taken a one-week hiatus in
the middle of shooting to avoid burning out cast and crew.  This was true of B5
throughout its history.  One week in the fall, one in the spring.

TNT has allocated additional money to build some major (large) new sets that we
had thought we'd have to wait until season 2 to implement, and to improve some
of the sets.  (We were always fighting to spiff up sets throughout B5, and we
always had to bring in our new sets gradually, like Earharts and the War Room
and others.) 

Since they're going to give us the money for that now, we figued we'd extend
the hiatus by a few weeks (a paid break for most of the actual shooting crew),
though we still have the art department, costume, construction, props and
several other departments still working away to build the sets and stuff.

We start shooting again October 19th.

On the other hand, not everybody has family to travel to, or the means to
travel.  So perhaps a family gathering of another type, particularly among
folks new to each other in local fan areas, might be even more appropros.

Given the content, and the likely reaction of fans to that content, a sports
