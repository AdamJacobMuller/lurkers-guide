Then you'd better up your insurance, real soon.

I'll just say this: we were lucky to get one "Coming of Shadows" episode a
year, a while back.  In the latter half of this season, especially from about
516-520 or thereabouts, we have one just about eveyr week.

I gave folks a respite for the first part, because in the second part of this
season, I'm going to hurt you.  There will be some light at the end, because I
wouldn't end this otherwise, but in the interim, it's gonna be pretty damned
intense.

Subject: Re: ATTN JMS: Bruce B and Cast Turmoil?

The real bottom line is, it's not easy when one's horse is shot out from under
one.  There's no way to take it lightly.

I've been saying for five years, "This is a five year story.  When it's over,
it's over."  But there's the statement, and the reality of the statement; two
different things.  To the viewers, it's the end of the story.  To an actor,
it's "I'm out of work now because Joe said it was a five year story instead of
a six year story."  

I know that a lot of the cast have been in denial about this for a long time,
many of them said in interviews, "Yeah, well, Joe's said it's a five year arc,
but I don't see why it couldn't go longer."  But if you live in that notion,
then when the reality hits, it hits hard.

So the reaction is perfectly understandable on an emotional level.  When a show
is over, everyone's gone.  In this town, that usually means "you're fired, the
network doesn't like you or the show."  It's a personal rejection.  Here it was
my decision, from the git-go, that this series would go five years and no more.
 That's kind of a new thing, and takes some getting used to.  You can only
interpret it by what you've experienced before.

One or two cast members may transition over into Crusade, assuming it goes
ahead, but that show *has* to be its own show, it can't be just a repackaged
B5.  (And I'm referring to regulars here, there's plenty of room for
guest-starring roles for nearly all of our characters at one point or another,
plus the likelihood of more B5 TV movies, plus the real possibility of a B5
feature.)

It's an emotional reaction, and totally understandable.

We're not doing a lot of changing.  One thing that does tend to get changed for
a new series is the *look* of the show, you want Crusade to have a different
and distinct appearance, to be its own show.  So for instance we're bringing in
new graphic designers to do screen stuff and signage and other related stuff.  

Other times it's an individual choice.  Anne Bruice-Aling recently had a baby,
and she wants to dedicate the next year or so toward raising her kid, so while
she'll remain available for occasional stuff or consulting, we'll have someone
else heading up the wardrobe department.

Mainly, you want to hold onto as many of your original people as you can,
because we've trained our folks to work in a certain, particular way.  Nobody
else really does things the way we do them on B5, and it's wiser to hold onto
your crew, and give incentives, to keep them around.  (We tend to promote from
within the ranks and reward loyalty rather than bring in new folks, that sort
of thing.)

I put in it basically whatever I think will be useful to anyone, as much as I
can think up.  Characters' names, backgrounds, descriptions, the kinds of
stories we are looking for, the kinds of stories we *don't* want to see, what
is good SF and what ain't, sample storylines we plan to develop, that sort of
thing.

I'm now in the process of converting over the "sell treatment," done for the
network, to a working series bible, which will go out to those writers with
whom I've either worked before, or whose work I know and have wanted to work
with for a while (as was the case with Neil Gaiman).

Subject: Re: ATTN JMS: Flawed Concept in Crusade? (Possible Spoiler)

A couple of other people have raised this question; here's why I consider it a
non-issue.

Does anyone here really think that, after X-years of following the Crusade
story, we're going to come to the end in which our heroes look out through the
window of the Excalibur at a dead Earth...glance at each other...shrug...and
say, "Oh, well, I guess we should've found it ten minutes earlier, huh?"...and
head off into the sunset.

Anybody out there see this as a likely scenario?  Raise your hands.  

Yes, they're going to find the cure at some point.  Where and when and how, and
in what segments, is one issue...and the rest is the journey to *get* there. 
It's like saying, "We know the wagon trains got to California, so nothing
interesting could've happened along the way."  Tell that to those who died
along the way.

You're confusing the issues with the following:

>If the 
>show's basic premise is that the hero's are searching for something
>(in 
>Voyager's case, a way home; in Crusade, a cure) then the viewer knows in
>
>advance that they will not find it (until possibly the end of the series, if
>at all). 
>Because if they did, it would by defintion, change the shape of the
>show. 

There you make my point for me.  That's the frustration aspect: you know if
they get home, the show's over.  So they will never get home, the viewer knows
that, and gets frustrated.

Here, you know that eventually, somehow, humanity will be saved.  So there's no
frustration knowing it ain't ever gonna happen.  Instead, you can sit back and
see how it happens, and who is affected by what happens.  

This is something very common to what I've done with B5's story telling. 
Starting at episode 1 of season 1, we learn that G'Kar and Londo will die
strangling one another.  I put those cards right on the table, face-up.  Did
that ruin anything for anybody?  Much to the contrary, as we learned the
process that led up to, and following, that incident.  If anything, knowing
that in advance added a whole new layer and subtext to the show.

I've always looked for ways to experiment and turn viewers preconceptions
upside down and back on themselves.  Crusade will let me take this a step
further.

Bottom line...I didn't turn suddenly stupid.  I know exactly what I'm doing
with this.

I really wasn't looking to the result as much as the process.  I expected a

Nope.

Certainly the presence of the psychos has from time to time made it more

go out into the room one more time where the nutcases can get to you.  I've
been lied to, lied about, slandered, libeled, accused, villified, tarred (and
sometimes feathered) in absentia, and dead-catted for, essentially, the crime
of talking to the people who like my show.  And the emotional cost of that does
add up over time.

Nope.  There's as much constructive criticism there as anywhere else.  What it

certain things, he did not notice the intricacies of what was going on in the
composition.

His guest walked down the hall, considering the work -- sunflowers, landscapes
-- and at the end of the tour, announced, "You paint too fast."

"No," Van Gogh said, "you LOOK too fast."

Subject: Re: Why doesn't Sheridan warn him?!

>Why the
>heck doesn't Sheridan try to warn Londo about what he saw??

This comes from not separating out what we the viewers know, from what the
characters know.  

What Sheridan knows is that 17 years from now, Londo had something on his
shoulder called a Keeper, which may or may not have a direct connection with
the apparent attack on Centauri Prime by Shadow allies.  

What he doesn't know is, did this happen 16 years ago?  Or six months ago? 
What process led it to happen?  What should he be warning Londo *about*?  He
saw the result...but what process, what event should he warn Londo about to
avoid this?  He doesn't know that the Regent has a keeper, the Regent could be
acting in these ways for his own reasons entirely.

Further, there's a certain trickiness about time stuff.  Okay, so he warns
Londo about something he doesn't really understand...does he now change the
future?  Does he have someone else other than Londo now on the throne, who
won't spare his and Delenn's lives?  

There are too many variables, and not enough actually known by him, to say
anything that would be of any use to anyone.

Too much of the former, not enough of the latter.

>How much time did you spend on the B5 set while they were filming?

It varies.  In the beginning of the series, I spent a lot of time on the stage,
because we were setting the style and look of the show, and directors were
still trying to figure out what I wanted, and how to deliver what I wanted. 
Over the last couple of years, though, that's decreased...in part because the
directors and the cast all know what's expected, and it's become a well-oiled
machine.  It's also in part due to the increase of my responsibility on the
writing/producing side...by the time I take care of what needs doing, the day's
nearly over and I haven't even made it out to the set once (which kinda bums me
out when it happens).

>   How much time do you spend answering these on-line questions?

I'm on line generally 2-3 hours a day.

>   How much time do you get to sleep?

On weekdays, during production, average about 3-4 hours a night.  I'm at the
stage in the morning, lunch is usually about 1, I'm there until about
6:30-7:00, I get a bite to eat on the way home in most cases, I get behind the
keyboard at about 8-8:30, and I'm there until I crash about 4:30 a.m., and then
I crash.  On weekends I try to make up for the lost sleep as best I can.

>   How much time does it take to write or "fix" a script?

Writing a script is invariably faster than fixing an outside script.  I can
write a script from zero in an average of 5-7 days.  On a few rare occasions
it's gone longer, but when that happens, I find I lose the white-heat of the
story, and it wanders a bit.  In a few cases I've written a script in a day or
two (A View from the Gallery all came out of my keyboard in one day, between
about 4 p.m. and 3 a.m.)

>   How much time do you spend at home or at "work".

It's all work.  Just the office differs.

On the one hand, you have to be brutal with your *writing*, you can't be too
close to the material.  You have to be able to look at how you present
something from as objective a point of view as you can.  

On the flip side, you have to be as faithful and true to your characters as you

they're two different creatures.  Learning how to differentiate the two is just

No, you put someone in the main titles when you make an overall deal, usually 8
episodes or more, with an actor in advance of the season.  With Walter, we
average about 4 eps per season, and they are each negotiated individually, as
they come up.

So in other words, your friend thinks that an actor who is in one successful
show should never work in the TV business, ever again, on any other show,
whether he's a good actor or not.

Your friend is a yutz.

The problem, however, is that since they came from the original production
track, they had a great deal of background noise on them, and in many cases
weren't satisfactory to be heard clearly by most people.  We could put them
back, but then many people wouldn't be able to understand them well, which
kinda defeats the point.

Those are colored streamers/trailers being made by a pair of Starfuries.

Subject: Re: ATTN Jms Season 4 Compression

I basically slid the thing forward about 4 episodes or thereabouts; the
resolution as shown was always the planned resolution.

Interestingly, there have been a number of reviews of the B5 videotapes running
in the British SF magazines, and several of them have mentioned how Into the
Fire actually played much better seen all as a piece with the preceding and
following episodes than they thought it did the first time, which is what I
kinda figured would be the case.

Depends on how bad the script was.

Yep, though having a series bible will help.

Yep again...having freelancers is actually more difficult even than doing them
myself, but frankly, the only way to find writers who you *can* eventually
bring on staff is to make freelance assignments and see who can hear the music
and who can't.

Subject: Re: Attn JMS: Shadows and Hegel?

This has come up before...and yes, there is a certain amount of Hegelian
thinking in the approach of the Shadows philosophy, that conflict is a
requirement for progress.

It's also couched somewhat in Jungian terms of the Shadow, which seemed as good
a place as any to hide the necessity of conflict.

Subject: Re: ATTN JMS:Black and white pictures, in the future???

Why not?  

I have some pictures of me in B&W as well as color, mainly because in many
cases B&W *looks* better under various lighting conditions.  Go to any good
sized display of art photos, and you'll see that the *majority* of them are
B&W.  

There seems to be this notion that the future means throwing away anything that
isn't at the edge...and it ain't true.
