PILOT MOVIE NARRATION
---------------------

     "I was there at the  dawn of the  third age of mankind.  It began in
     the Earth year  2257  with the  founding of  the last of the Babylon
     stations, located deep in neutral space.   It was a port of call for
     refugees, smugglers,  businessmen,  diplomats and  travellers from a
     hundred  worlds.  Could be  a dangerous  place, but we  accepted the
     risk because Babylon 5 was our last, best hope for peace.

     "Under the leadership of its' final commander, Babylon 5 was a dream
     given form... a  dream of  a galaxy  without war,  when species from
     different  worlds  could live  side by side  in mutual  respect... a
     dream that was in danger as  never before by the  arrival of one man
     on a mission of destruction.

     "Babylon 5  was the  last of  the  Babylon  stations.  This is  its'
     story..."

SEASON 1 NARRATION
------------------

     "It was the dawn of the  third  age  of mankind, ten years after the
     Earth/Minbari  War.  The Babylon  Project  was a dream  given  form.
     Its' goal: to prevent another  war by  creating a place where humans
     and aliens could work out their differences peacefully.  It's a port
     of call, home away from home for  diplomats, hustlers, entrepreneurs
     and  wanderers;  humans  and aliens  wrapped  in two  million,  five
     hundred thousand tons of  spinning metal...  all alone in the night.
     It can be a dangerous place, but it's our last, best hope for peace.
     This is the story of the last  of the Babylon stations.  The year is
     2258.  The name of the place is Babylon 5."

When Ambassador Kosh of the Vorlon Government arrives on Babylon 5 he is

the crew discover that the assassin is apparently Commander Jeffrey
Sinclair, who finds himself on trial.  But as the crew investigate further
the mystery deepens, and as Garibaldi digs deeper bodies begin turning up

mystery and find the real assassin before the arrival of the Vorlons, who

[5]  SEASON 1 UK EDITS
======================

All information included here are based on edits made on 1st run episodes.
Repeated episodes that may have been further edited are not included.  If
you know of any other edits, e-mail me all the details!

Edits are listed in the format:-

[ep. #]  [title]
[edited scenes]

A02) "The Soul Hunter"

  a) Just before the tramp is killed by the other tramp with the knife,
     there has been a 1-2 second edit where you should have seen a close
     up of the knife the killer is holding.

A07) "The War Prayer"

  a) In the teaser with the Minbari poet being stabbed, you only see a
     flash of the butterfly knife (a martial arts knife, a.k.a. ballisong)
     twice and then the stabbed Minbari poet fall down before being
     branded.  You don't see the actual stabbing.

     The US version shows the knife 3 times and then the actual stabbing.

  b) The scene where the Oriental pro-earth man is attacked by aliens is
     cut.  Basically he gets beaten up a lot more in the US version!  The
     UK version lasts 17 seconds.  The US version lasts 42 seconds.

A08) "And the Sky Full of Stars"

  a) In the scene where Sinclair has the complete version of his flashback
     of the "Battle of the Line", he says "Not like this, not like this,
     if I'm going out I'm taking you with me."

     In the US version he actually says "Not like this, not like this, if
     I'm going out I'm taking you bastards with me."

A09) "Deathwalker"

  a) In the teaser where Jha'dur is attacked by Na'Toth, you see Na'Toth
     beating Jha'dur onto the ground - suddenly she miraculously has a
     metal staff/wrench in her right hand and is about to strike Jha'dur
     before getting held back.  What you don't see is the edit where
     Na'Toth picks up the wrench and hits Jha'dur a couple of times, and
     boy-o-boy was it painful!

A10) "Believers"

  a) After Franklin has performed the operation on Shon, his parents see
     him and back off, start chanting and the father draws a knife.  The
     knife scene is cut and you see them back off slightly - suddenly
     Sinclair shouts at Franklin.

A11) "Survivors"

  a) The scene where Garibaldi is fighting Cutter during the countdown is
     edited.  You did not see Cutter draw a knife.

A14) "TKO"

  a) This episode was not aired originally due to Channel 4 deeming that
     the content of the violence ('alien bare-knuckle kick-boxing') was
     too strong for a 6pm showing, so they skipped this episode completely
     during the original run.

     After much UK fan pressure, they finally aired the episode (un-cut)
     on Saturday, 21 January 1995 @ 10.35pm.

A18) "A Voice in the Wilderness, Part 1"

  a) The scene in the bar where Garibaldi thumps the man who is making
     remarks about the people on the Mars colony has been edited.
