Plot Points

     * At least one race, the Drakh, made its home on Z'ha'dum during the
       Shadows' tenure there. They evacuated before Z'ha'dum's
       destruction and are in search of a new home and revenge against
       the people who defeated their masters.
     * Marcus and Franklin have convinced the resistance movement on
       Earth and Mars to follow Sheridan's lead, and to refrain from
       future terrorist attacks aimed at destabilizing Earth's
       government.
     * Ivanova is preparing for an additional job, as head of the "Voice
       of the Resistance," an attempt to counter ISN by broadcasting
       opposition views, as well as messages intended for the resistance
       fighters themselves, to Mars and Earth.
     * ISN, meanwhile, seems to be preparing Earth's citizenry for an
       eventual assault on Babylon 5, building up public support for such
       a move in advance.
     * Sheridan was involved in the suppression of the food riots on Mars
       after the Earth-Minbari War, for which he's resented by some Mars
       residents.
       
Unanswered Questions

     * Are the Drakh the only survivors of Z'ha'dum? How many of them
       remain?
     * Are the Drakh the ones responsible for planting Keepers on the
       Centauri Regent ([20]"Epiphanies") and Captain Jack ([21]"Racing
       Mars")?
     * Why did the Drakh emissary appear to shimmer? Do the Drakh have
       access to the Shadows' invisibility technology?
     * What does the warrior caste hope to gain by forcing the other
       castes out of cities?
       
Analysis

     * Franklin has bought into Sheridan's cult of personality, though
       it's not entirely clear why. His reaction to the skeptical
       resistance leader is exactly the kind of thing Garibaldi
       complained about in [22]"Racing Mars," and may be
       counterproductive in that it makes Garibaldi's allegations all the
       more credible.
     * Phillipe bombed the Red Planet Hotel, which was where Franklin and
       Marcus were staying. Was the appearance of the Earth security
       forces there a coincidence, or were they after Franklin and
       Marcus?
     * Why does Sheridan think he has the power to promise Mars
       independence after Clark is out of office? Does Sheridan plan to
       assume the presidency himself? Or was that simply more
       improvisation on Franklin's part? Presumably not; it's unlikely
       Sheridan gave him the authority to make that kind of promise
       without consultation.
     * How will Sheridan break through Earth's jamming of outside
       broadcasts? Franklin was able to get a message back to Babylon 5,
       but presumably it's a thornier problem to try to broadcast
       programming to all of Earth. Perhaps he'll enlist the help of
       Draal; Epsilon 3 likely has the power to cut through whatever
       interference Earth can muster. Delenn is unlikely to be able to
       provide any Minbari assistance, considering what's going on on
       Minbar, though the White Star fleet might be useful mobile
       transmitters.
     * If Number One indeed treats all her former lovers like she treated
       Phillipe, Franklin may be in for a rough ride.
     * In the first scene with Franklin, Number One rubbed her neck,
       similar to Captain Jack before his Keeper was discovered
       ([23]"Racing Mars.") Any significance, or just a stiff neck?
     * The Drakh ships, especially the transport, looked more Vorlon in
       design than Shadow. Have they looted the Vorlon homeworld as well,
       or is it just a coincidence?
     * The Drakh aren't the only race who worked for the Shadows, though
       of course they might have been the only ones to escape with
       technology from Z'ha'dum. Neither the surgeons and pilot in
       [24]"Ship of Tears" nor the creature in [25]"The Long Dark" were
       Drakh in appearance, though the latter arguably bore a resemblance
       when it was shown briefly reflected in Mariah's tube.
     * It's also possible the Drakh weren't allies of the Shadows at all;
       the Vorlons may have similarly had minor races acting as aides,
       and those aides would likely be just as upset as the Shadows'
       about Sheridan and Delenn driving their masters away. Of course,
       the statement that the Drakh had just lost their home would seem
       to indicate that Delenn's supposition about their association with
       the Shadows was correct; the Vorlon homeworld is probably still
       intact.
     * The Drakh may have some kind of group mind. At the very least,
       they have a different notion of personal identity than most other
       races. They appear to regard the name "Drakh" as both a collective
       name and a personal one, and their emissary interrupted Forell
       before he could utter Delenn's name, dismissing it as
       "unimportant." On the other hand, they're familiar enough with the
       notion of individual names to recognize Delenn's once it was
       spoken.
     * Delenn's reaction to the destruction of White Star 16, while
       arguably justified, bore similarity to her reaction to the death
       of Dukhat: ordering a relentless attack on those responsible. Of
       course, this time she was in control of the situation and wasn't
       enraged, but it's interesting in light of her earlier comment that
       she wouldn't repeat the mistakes made during first contact with
       humanity.
     * Delenn commented to Sheridan that she felt humans could have been
       Minbar's most dangerous enemy due to their ability to form
       communities of diverse elements. This echoes her comment in
       [26]"And Now For a Word," in which she said that the forming of
       communities was one of humanity's greatest strengths.
       
Notes

     * Marcus said he was from Arisia Colony. That's a reference to the
       Lensman series by E. E. "Doc" Smith.
     * Sheridan referred to the Drakh as "wild cards." And in fact,
       "Drakh" is "card" pronounced backwards.
     * One of the Minbari seen reacting in fear from the Drakh emissary
       is Dennis Michael, a CNN entertainment reporter and a big fan of
       the series. He was also a Narn in [27]"Comes the Inquisitor."
     * As the Drakh emissary entered the White Star's bridge, the lights
       on the wall dimmed.
     * The real reason the Drakh shimmered, according to special effects
       technician Ken Busick, was that the costume didn't look convincing
       enough. So to give the Drakh an otherworldly appearance, the scene
       was digitally manipulated in postproduction.
       
jms speaks

     * _Why did Franklin send a video message?_
       So they could see him and know by seeing him that he arrived
       safely; a text message could be sent by *anyone* who could've
       intercepted them.
     * The issue of waste of bandwidth is not as big a deal to an
       advanced technology (from today's standards); also, any really
       good telepath could rip out those codes and keys in about 10
       seconds. Further, they would've had a password to use (as in "the
       board," which he used) to verify that he was all right and not
       being forced to make the call.
     * In that scenario, there is no such thing as ANY kind of secure
       communication, which puts us pretty much back where we started.
     * _About the Drakh ships_
       I indicated a flower-like design. With the lethalness behind them,
       it seemed like a nice contrast.
     * _White Star 16 wasn't too tough._
       Of course, you have no way of knowing how many previous hits it
       took during the fight, and are assuming it only got two.
     * _Why did Delenn run?_
       As she states in the episode, they were at that time *surrounded*
       and if they turned to fire, would get destroyed. Firepower doesn't
       solve every problem; one good hand-held Lancet missile can put
       down a full-sized cruiser if it hits right. They were in the
       MIDDLE of the Drakh, just as they said, and that's NOT a
       defensible position. They had to get away, outside that group, so
       they could mount an offensive. This they did.
