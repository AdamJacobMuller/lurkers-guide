Plot Points

     * The League of Non-Aligned Worlds has agreed to give the White Star
       fleet authority to operate as a police force along its borders.
     * Civil war has broken out in the Minbari capital city.
     * Three quarters of Clark's cabinet resigned in protest of his
       martial law decree.
       
Unanswered Questions

     * Is Neroon really betraying Delenn?
     * The episode focused on the religious and warrior castes. What
       happened to the worker caste? Are they participating in the
       fighting, and if so, which side have they taken?
       
Analysis

     * Will the Non-Aligned Worlds' pledge to help Sheridan with any
       larger missions extend to his conflict with President Clark? Even
       in its diminished state, the combined forces of the Non-Aligned
       Worlds' navies would likely be a great asset if the conflict came
       down to a direct, prolonged series of battles. On the other hand,
       intervening in internal Earth matters isn't what the ambassadors
       had in mind; they might balk at sending their ships to die for the
       cause of overthrowing Earth's government.
     * By allowing the White Star fleet to patrol Centauri space in
       search of the Drakh (among others,) Londo has given Sheridan
       direct influence over the ability of the Shadows' allies to exact
       their revenge on Centauri Prime. Perhaps that's the source of
       Londo's comment in [18]"War Without End" about Sheridan allowing
       the Shadows' dark servants to slip through to Centauri Prime; if
       Sheridan uses the White Star fleet for some larger mission as he
       hints he might, it'll presumably be at the cost of Centauri
       Prime's defense against the Drakh.
     * During the conversation between Londo and the Drazi ambassador,
       Londo's duplicity is underscored by the staging of the scene. In
       most of the scene, two images of Londo can be seen: his reflection
       in the mirror or his portrait. The rest of the time his face is
       obscured by a curtain.
     * In the past, Delenn has attempted to preserve Lennier's innocence
       (e.g. by trying to leave him behind in [19]"Atonement.") But from
       Lennier's point of view, she has an innocence of her own, and he
       sees himself as its guardian.
     * Neroon may not be betraying Delenn at all; he told Shakiri the he
       knew the religious caste's counterattack plans, but Delenn made no
       mention of a counterattack. It's possible his departure was, in
       fact, all part of Delenn's plan; Lennier wasn't privy to the
       conversation between Delenn and Neroon, so he wouldn't know the
       details and would be fooled by Neroon's departure.
     * By revealing how much she relies on Lennier, Delenn may have given
       valuable information to an opponent. Neroon was honorable enough
       and helped Lennier, and seems uninterested in directly battling or
       hurting Delenn (if he'd been interested in that, he wasted several
       opportunities while on her ship.) But if Neroon passes the
       information along to Shakiri, Lennier may find himself in danger.
     * Neroon said of the situation on Minbar, "We are a world gone mad."
       That's the same thing one of the council members told Delenn in
       [20]"Atonement," before declaring, as Neroon did, that the fire
       would have to burn itself out and couldn't be stopped. Yet the
       Earth-Minbari War did stop abruptly; perhaps the same will happen
       in this case.
     * Neroon's comment about loving a good mystery also echoed
       [21]"Atonement," in which Delenn said to the Grey Council that
       mysteries are a gift from the universe and shouldn't be ignored.
     * The religious caste member said he heard Delenn say, "The
       religious caste could not be allowed to win this war." But she
       actually said, "The warrior caste cannot be allowed to win this
       war. The religious caste cannot be allowed to win either." Was he
       simply embellishing a half-overheard comment (e.g. if he only
       heard the second sentence up to "win") or did he choose to ignore
       or lie about the context?
     * The religious caste has been the butt of jokes about surrendering
       "ever since the war," according to the same religious caste
       member. Clearly that can't be referring to the Shadow War, since
       they didn't surrender. Does the comment indicate that most Minbari
       still consider the Earth-Minbari War to be the major war of recent
       memory? Since the warrior caste is the group making the jokes, the
       implication is that they didn't particularly participate in the
       Shadow War.
     * The two storylines in the episode can be seen as point and
       counterpoint on the subject of deception and secrecy (the title is
       evidence that this isn't an accident.) Delenn kept her plans
       secret from her compatriots and nearly died with them as a result.
       Neroon was attacked for the same reason. Sheridan kept secrets as
       well, and asked Franklin and Londo to lie for him, and it helped
       his plans come to fruition.
       Lennier's deception played into the theme; he kept the true nature
       of the sabotage from Delenn, with no immediate ill effect.
       However, it's possible that by maintaining Delenn's excessive
       faith in her caste, Lennier in fact deprived her of vital
       information she'd do well to take into account in the future.
       Ivanova held fast to the ideal of truth, but every other major
       player in the story participated in some form of deception: the
       rebellious religious caste members hid their plot, the League
       ambassadors kept their "knowledge" of the new enemy from Sheridan,
       and Neroon lied to either Delenn or Shakiri about his intentions.
       
Notes

     * Delenn mentioned this as the second time she'd seen Lennier near
       death. The first was in [22]"Convictions," in which he risked his
       life to save Londo Mollari.
     * Ivanova tells Sheridan that Marcus is waiting for him on channel
       4. That's a reference to the network that shows B5 in the UK.
     * Editing glitch: during the opening scene, a piece of food appears
       on Marcus' fork while the camera shifts to Sheridan; the scene
       shifts again and he hasn't picked the food up yet.
       
jms speaks

     * The Sheridan stuff was fun, in that I got to play Sheridan as the
       one being manipulative for a change, smart for a change...not just
       Londo or the usual suspects. It made for a nifty change of pace.
       And yeah, Mira brought a lot of truth to this episode...and will
       bring even more in next week.
     * _Ivanova looked like she was reading from a teleprompter._
       Yeah, we had Claudia use a teleprompter there to add to the sense
       of having to read something...and enjoy the happy-go-lucky
       Sheridan...it's the last you'll see of him for a long time....
     * _Lennier seems to be doing more peacemaking than Delenn. Is he the
       real bridge between races? Why does the religious caste follow
       Delenn?_
       No, I wouldn't say Lennier is a bridge in any sense along those
       lines.
       Delenn, you must understand, is a True Seeker, and among the
       religious caste there isn't much more admirable than
       that...combined with the fact that she *did* fulfill prophecy, she
       *was* the chosen of Dukhat, she *did* help end the Shadow
       War...yeah, she's had some problems here and there, but what
       important leader doesn't? Any one of those items would be a
       sufficient crown on a lifetime of achievement...the cumulative
       effect is quite daunting and impressive.
     * _Are Lennier's patience, humor, and devotion unique?_
       No, many Minbari share in those traits.
     * "Are tears a normal Minbari physical reaction, or is weeping (for
       Delenn) one of the changes mandated by her chrysalitic"
       We've seen Delenn cry before, when she and G'Kar were in her
       quarters and she was explining why she did not get involved in the
       Narn/Centauri war.
     * _How did Londo see an Earth sitcom if all broadcasts to B5 are
       being jammed?_
       Easy. The incident Londo is mentioning happened prior to the
       blackout. He never said it *just* happened, he said the *last*
       time Rebo and Zooty did their routine, everybody was doing it.
     * _Were Rebo and Zooty references to real people?_
       No, not intended as tributes to anyone, just a cool sounding pair
       of names (but also annoying sounding).
