     * A [21]newspaper headline describing some unusual political
       machinations.
     * Sinclair [22]reacts to something just before his ship is
       manipulated.
     * A small [23]device is held up in front of Sinclair at one point.
       Remember what it looks like; it'll appear again later in the

Backplot

     * In the days before the Earth/Minbari war, Dr. Franklin used to
       hitchhike starships, trading his services as ship's doctor in
       exchange for free passage to places he'd never been before.
     * _Franklin:_ "Towards the end, when things got bad for our side,
       those of us involved in xenobiology were told to hand over our
       notes to be used in genetic and biological warfare. [...] I took
       an oath that all life was sacred. I destroyed my notes, rather
       than have them used for killing."
     * After his squad was shot down at the Line, Sinclair's ship was
       disabled and taken aboard a Minbari cruiser. He was tortured and
       examined, and at one point stood unfettered within the circle of
       the grey council itself. When they didn't respond to his
       questions, Sinclair suddenly walked up to one of them and pulled
       back the hood, revealing the face of Delenn. He was then knocked
       out again, and some time later returned to his ship with no memory
       of the experience.
       _(A [24]synopsis of the events at the Line as Sinclair
       re-experiences them is available. There is also a separate
       [25]Guide page devoted to those events.)_
     * _Knight Two:_ "Your ship was off the screens for 24 hours. You
       didn't just black out, your ship disappeared!"
       _Sinclair:_ "The screens malfunctioned, the hearing proved that."
     * This would explain why Sinclair "fell off the merry-go-round"
       promotion-wise. Officers who've inexplicably disappeared in the
       presence of the enemy tend to hit a glass ceiling even if their
       loyalty is officially accepted.
     * The Knights may be part of a covert operation within Earth Force
       that's trying to find collusion between Earth officials and the
       Minbari.
       
Unanswered Questions

     * Franklin asks Delenn, "How were you involved in the war?" She
       declines to answer, even though he had just answered the same
       question from her. Toward the end of the episode it's revealed
       that Delenn did indeed play a significant role in the war, but
       little is yet known about what that was. (cf: [26]"Babylon
       Squared")
     * Sinclair's absence was first realized when Delenn reported that he
       didn't show up for a meeting with her in the Council room. What
       was that meeting to have been about?
     * Delenn said she checked with Ivanova before asked Garibaldi about
       Sinclair's absence. Ivanova is willing to page Sinclair about
       _everyday_ problems - why wouldn't she call his link when he's
       mysteriously long overdue for a diplomatic appointment?
     * Later, Delenn asks Ivanova if there's anything she can do to help,
       and Ivanova replies that the crew is doing everything possible.
       Yet why is she strolling down a corridor with Delenn, rather than
       following leads and scouring for new ways to find Sinclair?
     * How was Sinclair flawlessly abducted from his quarters?
     * How did Knight One get Benson's body off the station? (see [27]jms
       Speaks)
     * Who were the Knights working for?
     * Why wasn't telepathy used for the interrogation? It would have
       been no less legal than what the Knights did, and a telepath would
       probably have had better skills at dredging up old memories. The
       whole power source problem (which ultimately sunk the Knights'
       plan) could have been avoided - only the stimulation technology
       need have been brought on board.
     * Is Sinclair really a Minbari plant?
     * Why was Delenn's superior on the station?
     * _What is it that the Minbari don't want Sinclair to remember about
       his experience on the Line???_
       
Analysis

     * _Sinclair:_ "Everyone lies, Michael. The innocent lie because they
       don't want to be blamed for something they didn't do, and the
       guilty lie because they don't have any other choice."
       This is extra reason to think twice before taking anything said in
       this episode at face value. Nor should one assume that a lie
       covers up wrongdoing.
     * Earth Force was researching the use of genetic and biological
       warfare against the Minbari. These are offensive, not defensive
       methods, effective only on planets. They must have been planning a
       desperation ground strike of some kind. (cf: [28]"Soul Hunter")
     * After he punches Knight Two in VR, Sinclair looks at his hand,
       making a fist and releasing it. Scenes of him in the cybernet
       chair after that show him clenching his fist in real life as well,
       in unison with continued fist-clenching in VR. Sinclair is
       rediscovering, slowly, how to get his brain to control his body.
       The pain of the remembered zap in the council chambers is later
       enough to propel him all the way back, if groggily.
     * While looking for Sinclair's body outside, station forces discover
       the body of Benson floating outside Red Sector. Garibaldi visually
       identifies him (other Security folks had not been able to), and
       says, "Whoever killed him couldn't have carried the body very far
       without being noticed." He may be wrong in this conclusion -
       Knight One could have dumped it into a nondescript cart and gone a
       long way, for example.
     * _Garibaldi:_ "If they dumped the body out of an airlock, the
       station's gravity wouldn't let it get far." This is true _only_ if
       the body was dumped out of a no- or low-velocity airlock. Perhaps
       Garibaldi's assertion is correct because there aren't any
       high-velocity airlocks on the station other than the Cobra Bays.
     * _Knight Two:_ "Look at Earth: Alien civilization. Alien migration.
       Aliens buying up real estate by the square mile. What they
       couldn't take by force, they corrupted! Inch by inch!"
       This sounds very much like Homeguard propaganda - perhaps there is
       a connection. (cf: [29]"War Prayer")
     * Delenn exhibits ignorance of the powers of Earth telepaths -
       Ivanova had to explain to her that Talia, a P5, was not capable of
       a search-and-recover mission.
     * Ivanova's only contribution to the search effort was to track all
       ships that left Babylon 5 in the previous 8 hours, which turned
       out to be wasted effort. This and several [30]Unanswered Questions
       suggest she may have been working with the Knights.
     * _Delenn:_ "It's me, commander."
       _Sinclair:_ "I know - I know you. I know who you are."
       _Delenn:_ "I'm your friend, commander. Ambassador Delenn. _Your
       friend._"
       _Sinclair:_ "NO! I know you. I know you." [Knight One prepares to
       fire, Sinclair shoots him down]
       _Delenn:_ "Welcome home."
       [Sinclair collapses]
       By his emphatic denial above, it should be clear to Delenn that
       Sinclair is remembering _something_ about [31]his discovery of her
       at the Line. He later denies remembering anything, but she must
       wonder if he's lying. (If the [32]Analysis in the Line Guide page
       is correct, however, she should be _certain_ he is lying.)
     * Knight Two apparently remembered nothing about himself after
       Sinclair's destructive escape fried his memory. However, the word
       "Commander" brings him up short, and he remembers Sinclair's name,
       saying "There's something in my head. It says: 'Maybe you're still
       inside. Maybe we're both still inside.'" His phrasing there
       indicates that this is not his own current thought, but a thought
       that survived his brain damage. So, what did Knight Two, in full
       possession of his faculties, mean by that suspicion? The most
       obvious answer is "inside the simulation," but this is a very weak
       explanation, and goes nowhere.
     * Knight Two's last experience would have been watching Sinclair's
       recollection of his Grey Council experience, _including_ his
       discovery of Delenn (whom Knight Two may not have recognized).
     * See also the [33]Guide page devoted to Sinclair's recollection of
       the events on the Line.

jms speaks

     * Absolutely unlike anything ever produced before for television.
       Directorially, and in terms of the visual effects, the CGI, the
       performances, right across the board, it's a stunner. And just...I
       can't convey this enough...different. It just takes TV SF and
       yanks it to a whole other level of complexity.
     * As for a production report...things are going swimmingly. Today we
       started getting dailies on our first day of shooting on "And the
       Sky Full of Stars," which deals with the Battle of the Line. This
       is not going to look like your conventional episode of television.
       We've brought in equipment that you don't normally see on a
       television set, certain kinds of cranes and lenses and lighting
       packages that will give this particular episode a very strange,
       almost surreal look. It's quite remarkable.
       And Ron's pushing the envelope on the CGI...compositing some live
       action stuff with CGI that'll blow your TV out.
       It's going *well*.
     * Spent a very, very, very long day today in editing...not out of
       any problems, but because of the *astonishing* amount of detail
       we're putting into "And the Sky Full of Stars." Leaving out all
       the live- action shots, there are 25 CGI shots in one and a half
       minutes in one sequence alone. (By way of comparison, there were
       55 or so in the full two hour pilot for B5.) So we go frame by
       frame, making sure that everything meshes properly, through some
       pretty intense gistics. You'll understand when you see it.
       I've never seen the like of this particular episode before. It's a
       real gem.
     * On returns... Garibaldi's aide: yes. Knights: yes, but not
       identified as such.
     * Lurkers is indeed a net reference.
     * Psi Corps, as a government-regulated agency, is prohibited from
       endorsing candidates or taking a political stance.
     * I would *never* pull a "he wakes up and it was all a dream" on the
       series. I hate that kind of story.
     * It has *always* been my sense that the body was slipped out an
       access airlock in the zero-g cargo area. Every other access --
       like the boarding area and standard cargo area -- is under close
       security to prevent this kind of thing, or the influx of
       contraband. There's really nowhere to GO from the zero-g section,
       so it's a little looser. As for how he got the body there...there
       is an answer, and a reason, and if you look at this episode again
       after the season is over, even the nitpickers who brought it up
       will be able to figure it out. I didn't address it in the issue
       because I didn't think anyone would make a federal case out of
       this, and for other reasons that will in time become apparent.
       Several other nits picked at this episode will *also* be clarified
       by season's end. It's not easy to sit quietly, knowing the answer,
       and being unable to tell it, but that's simply what I have to do
       for the time being.
     * Psi Cops are *authorized* to carry firearms. The Knights had an in
       with Security, and by virtue of high government contacts, got
       their stuff on board. Those seem to me not requiring much
       explanation.
     * I can't believe this "explain how the guns get aboard" discussion
       is still going on. This isn't the Enterprise, to use the cited
       example, which is a *military vessel*, and only the occasional
       rare civilian gets on board. There are a QUARTER MILLION PEOPLE on
       board at any given moment. (People = humans and aliens.) Not
       staying there, but in a state of flux. Going and coming. Anywhere
       from 50 to 100 ships per day dock at B5. Thousands upon thousands
       of boxes, crates, cargo loads, pallets, you name it. If you
       stopped and inspected every single box that came through, the
       system would grind to a halt. So you do the best you can, you
       catch whatever you can, scan as much as possible, and accept that
       some stuff is bound to slip through.
       Further, this is the kind of explanation that has nothing to do
       with a story, only with someone's need to have something explained
       to them. I think the time is spent better elsewhere.
     * Yes, that is a triluminary on the grey council staff in "Sky."
       (cf. [36]"Babylon Squared")
     * Bear in mind, though, that Sinclair really had no reason to doubt
       what he remembered happening on the Line until the Minbari
       assassin uttered those seven fateful words. As for others...there
       have been suspicions, but more broadbased...and we'll deal with
       those a bit here and there.
     * Also, check the readout on Sinclair's screen as he's trying to
       engage the enemy. You'll see "negative lock" popping up. One
       problem in fighting the Minbari vessels is that they have a kind
       of stealth tech that makes it very hard for our weapons to lock
       on.
     * Bill Mitchell from "Sky" is a reference to General Billy Mitchell
       . . .
     * Yeah, it was an off-the-cuff reference to Billy Mitchell . . .
       (Didn't really mean that much; just thought it wuz cool.)
     * Re: "Sky"...my theory is to *never* assume prior knowledge of the
       background info that goes into an episode. If you never saw the
       pilot, you will miss *nothing* going into "Sky" (though it'd be
       nice because of one quickie flashback to know where that came
       from). I don't think anyone will have a hard time following that
       one.
     * This was one segment of the battle; there were others going on in
       other areas as well. It's said that no one ever *saw* the Battle
       of the Bulge; each saw a small part of it. Same here.
       Reality is, no matter how big we would've made it, more would've
       been wanted. (If anything, it seems that the more we show, the
       more is wanted.) But all things considered, best to have folks
       wanting more than wanting less....
       (And remember, we're managing to do all this with roughly *half*
       of TNG's budget. Give us their budget, and I'll show you ALL of
       the Battle of the Line, and the ENTIRE Earth/Minbari War, PLUS all
       their home worlds.)
       Nonetheless, as we go deeper into the season, the CGI/action
       sequences do get bigger and more detailed in many places. In
       "Signs and Portents" (formerly "Raiding Party"), you'll see three
       pretty good sized squadrons of ships engaged in a very fast-paced
       battle that goes on for most of an act and a half, as opposed to
       just a few scenes in "Sky." Big battles weren't really the *point*
       in "Sky," it was more about his REACTIONS and his personal fate.
       There were a number of action/battle shots we had on hand, but
       decided not to use because we didn't want to dilute the *point* of
       the scene.
       And as stated elsewhere...yes, you'll be seeing the Minbari war
       cruiser(s) again.
     * Actually, as you'll see in "Sky," sometimes the Good Guys *do* get
       their ships hit; sometimes they blow up and kill the person (as
       you will see), and sometimes they do damage without destroying the
       ship, in which case there is an eject mechanism that separates the
       cockpit part from the rest of the fighter, which contains the
       volatile reactors.
       So in those circumstances, a flight suit is a *very* good idea....
     * We actually had a lot more shots we could've used to prolong the
       sequence, but felt we *really* had to get to Sinclair, and go into
       his point of view more. Also we step-printed the CGI to give it a
       more dream-like appearance, since we're seeing this from inside
       Sinclair's memory, and he wasn't really able to *see* all this,
       particularly stuff happening around and behind him, this is more
       his *sense* of the events of that time. The sections we didn't
       step-print were those where he was RIGHT THERE, to make a subtle
       distinction.
     * What? Who, me? Near as I remember, the Question was, "What
       happened at the Battle of the Line?" Answer: Sinclair was taken
       aboard the Minbari cruiser, tortured, interrogated, mind-wiped and
       shoved back into his ship.
       The Question *now* is, "WHY was Sinclair taken aboard the Minbari
       cruiser, tortured, interrogated, mind-wiped and shoved back into
       his ship?"
       That question was not asked heretofore...so how could it be still
       unanswered?
     * A number of people have commented that they weren't much surprised
       by Sinclair being taken aboard, because on the nets -- and this
       has ONLY taken place on the nets -- this speculation has been
       bandied about for some time. We now have ten zillion speculations
       on the reason *why*. I will not comment on them one way or another
       (though I suppose I could point, without making the real
       comparison between types of typists, to the idea that an infinte
       number of monkeys typing on an infinite number of keyboards would
       eventually produce Hamlet simply by chance combination; sooner or
       later, something close to the reality might be stumbled upon...and
       let me ask a simple question: what purpose does that serve? It
       only lessens the enjoyment of those who would simply like to enjoy
       what happens WHEN it happens).
       Any good detective knows that you can't really begin to speculate
       about motive until you have all the information right at hand. At
       this point there is information you don't have...and absent that,
       any guesses will either be wrong, or close enough to hinder the
       fun but still essentially incorrect. It's like trying to guess the
       contents of a box without knowing the size of the box...it could
       be a marble, it could be an elephant or a pre-fabricated house.
       All I'm suggesting is that you consider not trying to come up with
       every possible angle, and let the show progress on its own. Right
       now everybody seems to be scrambling to make sure every even
       remotely feasible possibility is covered, and there an infinite
       number. As an organized activity, this will in time only prove
       frustrating. By the end of the season, as with being near the end
       of a movie, you'll have enough info on hand to start making some
       educated guesses. To do so now is to begin the proess of calling
       out possible endings during the first five minutes of a
       movie...you'll miss the important things, and annoy the people
       sitting behind you.
       I'm not saying stop; I'm just saying...relax, a little, I guess,
       and simply be aware that you *cannot* scatter-shot this thing
       without having access to all the information. It's like trying to
       guess the beginnings of World War One without knowing *any* of the
       background of the countries involved. Suffice to say that the
       reason would not be simplistic, or cliched, or *easily deduced*.
       One thing I learned in two years on "Murder, She Wrote" was to
       come up with a fairly complex mystery, something that can't be
       easily solved going in, but which makes perfect sense after you
       have all the facts and know which clues were the real ones, and
       which were simply red herrings.
       Just a thought....
     * We'd initially offered Walter [Koenig] the role of Knight Two in
       "Sky," but when his health prohibited using him, we went to
       Patrick McGoohan, who loved the script, wanted to do it, but was
       going to be out of the country at the time of shooting. We then
       shifted Walter to "Mind War."
     * Thanks. I love Patrick's work. Problem is he's *very* fussy on the
       roles he takes. (And justifiably so.) He has to be sold on the
       script or there's no deal. We'd sent him a copy of "And the Sky
       Full of Stars," which would have had him as the main interrogator,
       Knight Two...and he liked it, and was prepared to do it...when we
       checked our respective calendars and discovered that he was going
       to be out of the country when we were scheduled to shoot.
       We hope to get him at some later time. He's just terrific.
     * The CGI scenes were deliberately step-printed to give the shots a
       more dreamlike look.
     * The CGI won't look as good in slow motion because we step-printed
       them deliberately, in order to give them a more dream-like
       appearance. For us, this wasn't about the ships, it was about one
       of the men in the ship, which is why we kept him in sharp focus,
       and went to step- printing whenever we went outside (and since
       we're seeing this from his memory, clearly he wouldn't actually
       have *seen* most ofthis, it's his *sense* of what happened).
       You'll get plenty of clear CGI in "Signs and Portents," airing in
       May.
     * Actually, there's a second shot in which you can see a body being
       thrown out; it's between Mitchell and Sinclair being hit. Remember
       that the body is strapped in in an angular fashion, and look for
       it as it blows (as I recall) from left to right. It's there.
     * This weekend, I was at the Space Frontier Foundation to receive an
       award for Babylon 5 for Best Vision of the Future, part of which
       was its recognition of our *deliberate efforts* to get things
       right. Zero-G maneuvering, civilian use of space, a working
       O'Neill station, on and on, all the stuff you think happens by
       "coincidence." And which has not generally HAPPENED on TV before.
       In attendence were the Delta Clipper team of engineers, astronaut
       Pete Conrad, leading researchers with NASA, JPL,
       McDonnell-Douglas, you name it.
       And one of the people there, who had been with SDI and the Space
       Program for 12 years, currently a top-level NASA consultant,
       pulled me aside and said that after seeing the line about the
       gravity not letting the body get very far . . . he said he sat
       down to do the math required to come up with the actual MASS of
       B5, starting with the 2.5 million tons of actual structure, plus
       likely vegetation, quarters, occupants, ships docked inside...and
       when you add it all up, it came to about the same mass as a fairly
       small moon...and IT WOULD BE ENOUGH TO KEEP THE BODY FROM -- AS
       STATED IN THE SCRIPT -- GETTING VERY FAR.
       The body would drift from the station a bit, get pulled back, hit
       the hull, bounce, drift a bit, and be pulled back. Or go into a
       slow elliptical orbit. (He mentioned that in the history of the
       Apollo program, little bits of debris that would flake off the
       outside of the ship would remain in proximity to the ship, just on
       the basis of ITS mass and gravity, and it's not very big.)
       A couple of other high-level engineers backed him up, and said
       that it was quite reasonable.
     * The 2.5 million tons of spinning *metal* refers only to that part,
       the metal casing. It doesn't include the furniture, the
       structures, the Garden, the 250,000 humans and aliens...so the
       total mass of the thing is MUCH greater than the 2.5 megatons.
       Also, the body was shoved out of the area around the cargo bay,
       non-rotating, which would also cut down on the momentum (as
       opposed to shoving out out of the rotating part, where it would
       speed away at 1g).
     * Yes, it was always my assumption that the body was dumped out
       through the zero-g section, since that has more traffic with cargo
       loaders and unloaders and less security than the
       passenger-oriented bays and airlocks.
     * There is a security problem on B5, yes. And we hope to deal with
       it at some point. It's inevitable, really; 250,000 residents, huge
       crates being moved in and out every day, people going and
       coming... they try to confiscate what they can, but a lot slips
       through.
     * The second shot to Knight One is a gut-shot, and the security
       guard is shot through the chest.
       Bear in mind, also, that some of this may be expected by folks
       here on the nets because of the ongoing conversations, speculation
       and the bits of info I drop here; but for 99.9% of the rest of the
       nation, this IS new info. And even with the nets, I suspect that
       there are some surprises here....
     * _'Universe Today' Headline_
       I lived in San Diego from 1974-1981, and it's actually a great
       place, so I'm inclined to tweak it once in a while, just for
       funsies....
     * The wisp of smoke is a wisp of smoke, nothing more important than
       that. If something living in hyperspace bothers you...good, it
       should. The Psi Corps article is in frame for a reason. Yes, we
       sometimes put additional or important information in the
       background, but I don't think we can be fair and assume that
       everyone sees it, so if you don't see it in one place, it's stated
       out loud later on...the background stuff is to give the alert
       viewer a fighting chance to guess some stuff BEFORE it happens;
       when stuff DOES finally happen, all the required information is
       supplied at that time.
     * Correct, Gregory. One of the things we learned from the pilot was
       that we shoved too much information at people too fast. So I
       deliberately held back a lot of arc stuff in the beginning of the
       series, allowing people to move gradually into the B5 universe,
       learn more about it, and THEN start whapping them with the arc. It
       isn't until "Mind War" and "Sky" that we really begin cranking the
       arc.
