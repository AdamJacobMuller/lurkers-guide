Backplot

     * In his youth, Londo led the Centauri raid on a planet called
       Frallis 12.
     * Five hundred years earlier, the last of Varn's race died,
       entrusting him with a legacy, the guarding and caretaking of
       Epsilon 3. Some time prior to that, a violent, cruel faction of
       the race was cast aside by the rest, and since Varn took over
       Epsilon 3, they have been searching for it.
     * Some Earth citizens feel they're heavily subsidizing the Mars
       colony, and that may in fact be true.
     * The Centauri contributed a substantial amount of money to the
       construction of Babylon 5.
       
Unanswered Questions

     * What is the intended use of Epsilon 3?
     * What needs to happen before it will be deemed ready for
       consumption by the rest of the galaxy?
     * Was Takarn's ship the only one of its kind, or are more outcasts
       from Varn's race still out there, searching (or heading) for
       Epsilon 3?
     * Are there any other planets like Epsilon 3 waiting to be
       discovered?
       
Analysis

     * The station potentially has a powerful new ally in Draal. It
       remains to be seen if he will prove willing to come to the
       station's defense in the future, but the threat of retaliation by
       Epsilon 3 might be enough to keep any would-be attackers at bay.
     * Garibaldi's tentative hopes of one day getting back together with
       Lisa have now been dashed. This might make him that much more
       likely to hit the bottle again. (cf. [22]"Survivors")
     * Assuming Earth is successful in putting down the revolt on Mars, a
       continued presence will likely be necessary to keep things from
       flaring up again. This is bound to have political consequences
       back on Earth, and possibly on Babylon 5, as Earth has a harder
       time claiming the moral high ground if it's occupying one of its
       own members with soldiers.
     * Londo's sense of adventure, now reawakened, might lead him to go
       even further in his quest for the "good old days." Between this
       and his possession of the Eye (cf. [23]"Signs and Portents") he
       may be a much more influential figure than he appears.
     * Delenn's assessment of Sinclair jibes with the hints in
       [24]"Grail" that she considers him a "true seeker," someone whose
       life is devoted to a cause.
       
Notes

     * The heavy cruiser EAS Hyperion was named after the Babylon 5
       Internet archive (and home of the Lurker's Guide) originally
       located at Hyperion.COM.
     * Ivanova seems to enjoy saying "Boom!" (cf. [25]"Grail")
     * When Capt. Pierce is going to launch fighters to land on the
       planet and Sinclair threathens to destroy them, Pierce argues for
       a moment and then backs down. When he turns briefly to the screen
       and a computer graphic is displayed showing him calling down the
       ships, one of the ships in the top left corner of the screen has
       the flight number THX-1138, the name of one of George Lucas' first
       films.
     * More SF references can be found in the list of words being
       downloaded from the station's language files by the aliens. For
       instance, "ORAC" is a computer from the British series Blake's 7,
       and "Skynet" is from The Terminator. The phrase "I am not a
       number, I am a free man" (from the title sequence of The Prisoner)
       can also be seen on several consecutive frames.
       
jms speaks

     * BTW, have named an Earth Alliance Cruiser Hyperion, in notation of
       the library....
     * _Does the Earth Alliance have capital ships?_
       Of course there are capital ships. We never said otherwise.
       There's one later this season, for instance, the EAS Hyperion, a
       heavy Earth cruiser. There aren't as many as they'd like -- the
       majority having been wiped out in the war -- but they're building
       'em as fast as possible. (The Hyperion, though it's never
       mentioned, is one of the leftover capital ships, not one of the
       newer ones.)
     * _Will we see other ships like the Hyperion?_
       That design will never be seen again.
     * Correct; the Hyperion didn't have a gravity-positive section.
     * Of course, insofar as I recall, it wasn't stated in the episode
       that Varn's people actually *built* the Great Machine; after all,
       if they could build it, why would the others have been searching
       for it so frantically for the last several hundred years?
     * Actually the Hyperion is one of the few surviving heavy cruisers
       from the Earth/Minbari War period; after we lost a LOT of our
       ships, there were some new ones commissioned, which we haven't
       seen yet, which are far cooler than even the Hyperion (though
       we'll see them next season).
     * The captain of the Hyperion specifically states that he was
       already IN hyperspace, en route to another system, when he was
       ordered to stop here. His ship was already in the area. Also,
       there is a fair amount of time between the actions on the planet
       initially, and the arrival of the Hyperion...enough to know
       there's some kind of tech there, based on the initial attacks. The
       Hyperion continued to monitor reports as they came in.
     * And there we get into the contradiction; Ivanova and Sinclair down
       on the planet would be mainly more run-and-jump...Draal talking
       about his feelings, Delenn showing she is upset that her friend is
       going away and will never be seen by her again, their obvious
       friendship, that to me is characterization. And not just throwaway
       stuff, either, but important down the road.
       But hey, what do I know....
