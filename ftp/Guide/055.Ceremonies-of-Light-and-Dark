Backplot

     * In the old days of the Centauri Republic, poison was a common
       political tool.
     * Some humans learned the Minbari language from POWs during the war.
     * The rebirth ceremony in [21]"The Parliament of Dreams" was just a
       small part of a much larger renewal ceremony, traditionally
       performed in response to, or in anticipation of, a great change.
       Lennier believes B5's inhabitants are currently between two such
       changes.
     * The Minbari prophecy foretells fire and darkness after the two
       halves of the Minbari soul unite to combat the ancient enemy.
       
Unanswered Questions

     * How many more Nightwatch members are still on the station?
     * Did Garibaldi's people get rid of the artificial intelligence?
     * What else is buried in B5's computer system? (At least one
       unfriendly thing, as shown in [22]"A Spider In the Web.")
     * Who does Lennier believe Delenn is fated for? Sheridan? If so, is
       that due to his observation of the growing relationship between
       Delenn and Sheridan, or due to something in the prophecy?
     * What was Delenn planning to give up and to tell someone at the
       ceremony?
       
Analysis

     * Londo is playing a dangerous game with Refa; Refa will no doubt
       not take kindly to having his life threatened, and may retaliate
       against Londo either overtly or behind the scenes. Refa seems to
       have much of the royal court in his pocket while Londo's influence
       has waned since he broke off his association with Morden. Londo
       may find that he's bitten off more than he can chew.
     * However, the extent of the risk he's taking is a good indication
       that his realization of the dark nature of his former pact with
       Morden is complete; after this it will be very hard to turn back.
       It's interesting to note, though, that his basic goal hasn't
       changed, only his methods; note that he tries to dissuade Refa by
       talking about how dangerous the current Centauri policies are to
       their people. Londo is still first and foremost a patriot, not
       unlike G'Kar (at least until Kosh's revelation in [23]"Dust to
       Dust.")
     * Londo and Sinclair have something in common; Londo's poisoning of
       Refa bears a passing resemblance to Sinclair planting a
       transmitter in G'Kar's intestinal tract. Or rather, claiming to --
       which raises the question, did Londo _really_ poison Refa, or just
       say so? Like Sinclair, Londo might figure that the poison that
       doesn't exist can't be flushed out by doctors.
     * How did the Nightwatch get so much information about the Minbari,
       especially the details of Delenn's means of getting the war
       cruisers to Babylon 5? It may be as simple as Earth's normal
       intelligence channels, which, under Clark, presumably make at
       least some of their findings available to the Nightwatch.
     * Boggs' claim that the Minbari "think [Delenn]'s the second
       coming!" indicates that many among the Minbari agree with Delenn's
       assessment of herself as the chosen one, the vehicle of prophecy
       (see also [24]"Comes the Inquisitor.") Marcus also hints at this
       when he tells Delenn that his brother believed in the Rangers and
       in her; apparently her involvement with them is richer in
       symbolism than has previously been hinted at. How, and whether,
       that relates to the nature of Sinclair's involvement remains to be
       seen.
     * This isn't the first time Delenn has been referred to as "the
       second coming," at least indirectly. G'Kar quoted a passage from
       the Yeats poem of the same name in [25]"Revelations," a passage
       visually accompanied by Delenn's first look at her new appearance.
       Ominously, _that_ Second Coming refers to the Antichrist.
     * The Army of Light is now dressed in black uniforms. Whether that's
       an intentional contrast on Delenn's part, or simply her fashion
       sense, only time will tell.
       
Notes

     * The voice of Sparky the Computer, the artificial intelligence, is
       Harlan Ellison. Sparky's name is visible both in the ending
       credits and, very briefly, as the last line item in the computer's
       status messages when it reboots.
     * The recording Londo shows Refa is slightly wrong; Morden was
       sitting when he mentioned Refa's name ([26]"Matters of Honor.")
     * The station logo on the wall in C&C has changed. It used to be a 5
       with a pair of olive branches overlaid, presumably signifying
       peace; now it's a 5 over a sword. The new logo can also be seen on
       the top of the conference room table in the scene with Delenn and
       the officers from the Minbari ships.
     * There's a minor continuity glitch involving the new logo. When the
       command staff walks into C&C in the final scene, the camera pans
       across the side of C&C to show the startled techs. The new logo is
       visible on the wall between two computer displays. But in the next
       shot of the same wall, there's no logo there.
     * "Dem Bones" was also sung in the final episode of "The Prisoner."
     * The formation in which one of the Starfuries peels away as the
       squadron performs a fly-by of the caskets is called the Missing
       Man formation. It is used today whenever a flyby is part of
       military honors at a funeral.
     * As Delenn and Marcus wait for Lenann, a "Wet Floor" sign can be
       seen in a corridor in the background.
     * Sheridan's closing line, "Babylon 5 is open for business," echoes
       Laurel Takashima's in [27]"The Gathering." In both cases it marked
       a new beginning for the station.
     * Sheridan's line to Ivanova, "My hypocrisy only goes so far," is a
       Mark Twain quote.
     * Don Stroud got his scar by jumping into a crowd of men with knives
       to stop a woman from being raped, according to former story editor
       Larry DiTillio.
     * The eulogy recited by Sheridan is the same one spoken by Ivanova
       in [28]"Soul Hunter."

     * As it happens, episodes 8, 9 and 10 ("Messages," "Point of No
       Return," and "Severed Dreams") are kind of a triptych, linked at
       the hip and designed to pull together/blow out several major
       hanging plot threads once and for all, and send the show spinning
       off in an entirely different direction. The hardest one to write
       was 10, because it's a very emotional episode for the characters,
       and for me.
       And next is #11, which I begin to write this weekend...and #11,
       year three, is the *exact* midpoint of the 5 year story. This is
       the hump, the dead center of the journey. It took so long to get
       here, and suddenly we're halfway finished.
     * The episode is in the halfway mark, and that IS its significance,
       because it signals a major change.
       When we were midway through that episode, the halfway mark of the
       whole series, John, Doug and I were given these spiffy leather
       script books with silver inlaid initials by the crew, to
       commemmorate the event. It was really nifty.
     * _About Delenn and Lennier_
       As for Lennier...it's an unusual relationship, which you'll learn
       a LOT more about in "Ceremonies of Light and Dark." Which is all I
       can say for now.
     * I was kind of afraid that after the big Stuff Blowing Up Episode,
       anything afterward would be a let down because it couldn't have
       the same level of huge action (without killing everyone making the
       show). So the way to deal with that is to go in an entirely
       different direction; I was hoping that'd work, and glad that so
       far it has.
     * Earthgov sees B5 in much the way China now sees Taiwan. (Though on
       reflection that may not be the best metaphor....)
     * You only send an ambassador if you recognize something as
       legitimate, and EA will never recognize an independent B5.
     * _Why didn't G'Kar join in the ceremony?_
       Because he saw the actual co-running of security, and their
       duties, more important...that is physical, and concrete, and he
       feels is his surest way to win a seat in the new council. Actions,
       not ceremonies. He's very direct that way. (Which is pretty much
       what he said at the time.)
     * _Was this the same ceremony as in [29]"The Parliament of Dreams?"_
       Yes, it's the same ceremony; Delenn states as much in the episode.
     * _Was this one of Londo's chances for redemption?_
       No, this wasn't an opportunity for redemption. It would be flagged
       as much more important than this.
     * I don't think Londo feels he needs to be redeemed; his reasons as
       stated were quite sincere.
     * _Is Delenn being "destined for another" part of the prophecy?_
       It is now.
     * Certainly various sorts of love was at the core of the episode,
       and what we do for one another.
       But no, not all relationships have to end badly (despite my own
       general history in that regard).
     * _Is Lennier really satisfied with Delenn's destiny lying
       elsewhere?_
       Well, there was certainly that little catch in his voice, that
       hesitation, before he added "...in my heart."
     * "...note on Lennier: "a pure, higher love"? Pshaw, I've heard that
       before and seen the results in my own life. Are Minbari so
       different?"
       One would certainly hope so.
       And there are such different kinds of feelings even among humans;
       yes, you're right, often it doesn't work out that way...and
       sometimes it does.
     * I didn't see or intend any element of Lennier being racist; but
       there are definitely differences in culture and physiology between
       Minbari and humans. Minbari are very careful about personal space,
       and they don't like to be talked to a certain way. Marcus
       momentarily forgot himself, and acted inappropriately. Lennier
       corrected him.
     * _Delenn, Lenann, Lennier. What does "len" mean?_
       Basically, I went through and came up with common suffixes and
       prefixes for Minbari names, the way Russian names have
       combinations of certain letters (-ovna, -ova, -vich), and
       associated various backgrounds and castes and houses (fanes) to
       them. So you have Delenn, Rathenn, and others of similar name.
     * _About the slow buildup of the Delenn/Sheridan relationship_
       What you say about relationships is quite true. The slow process
       of getting to know somebody, the courtship, the parries and feints
       and false starts are 85% of the fun. It's the process of getting
       into somebody's mind, discovering who they are. And that's what
       these two are doing. It's an awful lot of fun.
     * The "romance angles" aren't "late additions," but you don't just
       leap into a romance right off. You couldn't have had the
       Delenn/Sheridan thing right in the beginning of year two, it had
       to be built, and grow gradually. Things are introduced as it is
       time for them to be introduced. The shadows weren't even named
       until season two, and didn't make their first appearance until
       late in season one. Is that a late addition?
     * I'm doing a lot to deepen up Marcus and Lennier, to let people see
       parts of them we might not have seen before. Everyone grows on the
       show; even at this point, compare Lennier to the wide-eyed
       innocent who first arrived at the station and couldn't even bring
       himself to look Delenn in the eyes.
       The computer voice, Sparky, wasn't really a nod of any kind to
       Hitchhiker's. (And 2001's HAL beat them to the punch a long time
       before that in any event.) No, I just figured, if the computer
       system had a glitch, what would it sound like? Answer...Harlan.
     * Actually, we had 3 more quickie scenes with the computer voice,
       but the ep ran long over time, and we were locked into some
       walk-and-talks where we couldn't make other trims.
     * _Is the name Sparky a reference to anything?_
       No, just figured it'd be a great name.
     * I also like the look between Marcus and Delenn as they stand in
       the customs area...he looks like he desperately wants to say more,
       and she like she desperately wants to hear it...but he turns and
       walks away, the moment lost.
     * _About female fans' reaction to Marcus_
       It's okay...so are most of the women who work in the editing bays
       at B5. The first few days of this season, as his stuff started
       coming in, one of them pulled me aside, and with hand firmly on my
       arm, to let me know she meant business, said, "Listen very
       carefully: I want to see a LOT more of Marcus."
     * _Was Marcus' beard different before?_
       Your memory is correct. Just before he did the first episode, he
       had to shave his full beard for some commercial audition. It
       hadn't grown all the way back, and we had to darken it down a bit
       to make it work. It's all back now.
     * _The Nightwatch members looked a lot more sinister than in the
       past. _
       I went just a little here for a kind of metaphorical approach;
       prior to this, Nightwatch folks have always been presented as
       starched, scrubbed, visually appealing...the face they wanted
       others to see. Now we see their true face, the scarred, dark,
       empty eyes, no longer pretending to hide. So we kinda cast in that
       direction.
     * _Boggs' scar wouldn't have moved like it did._
       The physical dynamics of the scar *would* have worked as seen,
       actually, mainly because that wasn't a piece of makeup, that's a
       real scar, and it does work that way.
     * The scar is real. He had some rough times a few years ago.
       (Actually, he also appeared with the scar as it's seen here in
       "TKO," as Garibaldi's corner man, though there it was hidden a
       bit.) He's still doing a lot of work though.
       (The funny thing was seeing the occasional comment on the nets
       saying how fake they thought the makeup looked, and why couldn't
       we manage to do something a bit more realistic looking?)
     * Actually, no, the song in "Ceremonies" was not intended as a
       Prisoner riff or homage of any kind. If the song originated with
       The Prisoner, that'd be one thing, but the song goes back a long,
       LONG ways before The Prisoner was even thought of.
       What happened, actually, was this...I'm a big fan of the Red Clay
       Ramblers, a terrific group that does sort of bluegrass but very
       offbeat. I was writing that episode, and I was playing with the
       torture aspect, and had one of their albums on. At just the moment
       I got to that scene, up came their rendition of "Ezekiel in the
       Valley of the Dry Bones." The notion was perfect, so I went back
       to the original version of the song, which is public domain
       (rather than their variation on it), and used it. Synchronicity.
     * _About the uniforms_
       I wanted it to have a crossed look, certain Minbari elements and
       textures, lines that are reminiscent of the Rangers, but also of
       Earthforce. Hence, the result.
     * There's a certain perverseness in making those on the side of
       light wear black uniforms. It reverses our expectations.
     * In general, it's my understanding that the cast really like the
       new uniforms. They're lighter, easier to move around in, cooler
       under the lights, and they like the styling, the rogue element to
       it, and the Minbari aspect.
     * _Couldn't Refa just have all his food and drink tested?_
       Of course the flip side of this is that you'd have to check every
       single thing you ate or drank every day, every week, for the rest
       of your natural life. Not the kind of life *I'd* like to live.
