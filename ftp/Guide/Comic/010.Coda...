Synopsis

   Sheridan breathes a sigh of relief as he barely makes it onto the
   shuttle. He accuses Greegil of trying to kill him; Greegil denies it.
   
   The cleaning robot chases Garibaldi and G'Kar through the station
   axis. As they somehow propel themselves forward, the robot grabs
   Garibaldi's boot and pulls it off, slowing down to process it. G'Kar
   suggests that Garibaldi feed it more; Garibaldi volunteers G'Kar's
   boots. G'Kar refuses and suggests they play another game of
   laser-mirror-starweb to decide whose boot will be next. G'Kar cheats.
   Garibaldi tosses a boot to the robot and grabs G'Kar, demanding to
   know what's going on. G'Kar reveals that he received a message telling
   him an assassin by the name of Greegil D'Farkin was coming to Babylon
   5 to kill him.
   
   Sheridan manages to stabilize the shuttle, but its diagnostics show
   "massive decalibration in the external transfibulator phase
   controllers" as well as damage to the oxygen recyclers. Sheridan dons
   a suit to go out and fix the transfibulator antennas, and advises
   Greegil not to waste their air complaining about the situation.
   
   Garibaldi and G'Kar continue to flee the robot. G'Kar notes that he
   promised his clan he would die honorably; Garibaldi says he intends to
   die in bed, on his 92nd birthday, in the arms of a beautiful redhead,
   shot by her jealous husband. G'Kar is puzzled; Garibaldi would be
   doing the husband a great service. As the robot nears, they play
   another laser-mirror-starweb game. This time, Garibaldi cheats more
   outrageously than G'Kar does, and G'Kar tosses a boot to the robot.
   
   Sheridan fixes the problem and finds that Greegil has locked him
   outside in space. He reminds Greegil that he has the code key to
   operate the ship, and uses that to bargain for information: why G'Kar
   fled. Greegil says his job is to stop G'Kar from sabotaging Babylon 5.
   Abruptly, Sheridan is back inside the ship. He proposes using
   electrolysis to produce oxygen from the ship's water supply.
   
   G'Kar and Garibaldi float away from the robot in their undershorts;
   it's still gaining. Garibaldi spots a maintenance hatch and pops it
   open; the two of them leave the inside of the axis tube and hang by
   handrails high above the Garden while the robot passes. Garibaldi
   doesn't let G'Kar back inside until he has the truth about Greegil:
   he's chasing G'Kar because of a woman, Greegil's wife, in fact. G'Kar
   refused to have sex with her to seal an alliance between two clans,
   even though it was his obligation as a high-ranking clansman; that was
   a grave insult to Greegil, who vowed revenge.
   
   Sheridan's shuttle returns to Babylon 5; Sheridan places Greegil under
   arrest. Ivanova reports that G'Kar and Garibaldi are still missing.
   
   Garibaldi somehow displays a message on the outside of the axis tube,
   indicating their location to the security staff and Sheridan. When the
   two of them emerge from the tube, Sheridan, Greegil, and a security
   team are waiting. Garibaldi arrests G'Kar for kidnapping him.
   
   In a security station, G'Kar, Greegil, Garibaldi, and Sheridan argue
   about whether Greegil should be allowed to kill G'Kar. Greegil even
   presents a license, signed by the council of clans. Sheridan dismisses
   it as invalid on his station. Greegil pulls out a laser pistol.
   Garibaldi and G'Kar duck behind a nearby mirrored table, reflecting
   the laser beam. Sheridan calls out for a starweb, which one of the
   security staff gladly fires at Greegil.
   
   G'Kar and Garibaldi walk away together. G'Kar explains that sleeping
   with Greegil's wife would have shifted the balance of power among the
   five clans... "And besides, she wasn't attractive enough to justify a
   war."
   
   Elsewhere, Sheridan admits to Ivanova that they can't really press
   charges against G'Kar... but keeping him busy with lawyers for a while
   will be punishment enough.
   
Backplot

   Take with a grain of salt; inconsistencies with the series abound in
   this story, and none of it should probably be considered canon.
     * Narn aristocrats consider education beneath them, something for
       servants.
     * There are five main Narn clans; G'Kar belongs to one of them.
     * Narn alliances are sealed with sexual liaisons.

     * I wasn't terribly pleased with the artwork on 9 and 10, I thought
       it could've been much better. As for the story, David Gerrold had
       proposed (and written) that as an outline for an episode; I said I
       didn't think it worked for our show. Which opened the door for DC
       to pick it up, and since he felt so strongly that it *did* work, I
       figured I'd let him proceed.
