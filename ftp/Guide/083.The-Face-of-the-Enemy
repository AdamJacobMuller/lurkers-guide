Plot Points

     * Clark's ship commanders have been convinced that if they surrender
       to Sheridan, they'll be killed and their crews replaced by
       Minbari. Perceiving they have nothing to lose, they are therefore
       willing to fight the rebel forces to the death.
     * Sheridan has been captured by Clark's forces. Garibaldi personally
       sprung the trap, which earned him a commendation from ISN and
       condemnation from Ivanova: she has ordered B5's personnel to shoot
       him on sight.
     * Ivanova is now in command of the rebel fleet, and has vowed to
       keep up the fight with or without Sheridan.
     * Sheridan's old ship, the Agamemnon ([23]"Points of Departure") has
       joined the rebel fleet. (See [24]Notes)
     * The telepath virus described by Wade and Lise in [25]"Conflicts of
       Interest" is indeed real, as is the drug to suppress it -- but the
       virus was developed by Edgars' company. It is airborne, 100%
       contagious, and completely harmless to normals. Telepaths have to
       take the cure every two weeks, or they'll die. Edgars' plan was to
       release it on Earth and use control of the cure to effectively
       enslave all the telepaths, preventing them from ever gaining the
       upper hand over normals. Bester believes the virus was developed
       with the help of the Shadows, who had a vested interest in wiping
       out telepaths.
     * When Justin told Sheridan that the Shadows wouldn't kill him
       because someone else would come along and take his place
       ([26]"Z'ha'dum") he had specific people in mind: Delenn, Ivanova
       and Garibaldi. The Shadows decided that given his innate paranoia,
       Garibaldi would be easiest to cause to turn away from Sheridan's
       cause, thus sabotaging the Army of Light in Sheridan's absence.
       The Psi Corps was given the assignment of programming Garibaldi.
       They took him to a secret facility on Mars, where Bester
       intervened and added some programming of his own.
       Bester was aware that some kind of action was being planned
       against the Corps, but he didn't know what or by whom. Given
       Garibaldi's proven track record at ferreting out conspiracies,
       Bester instructed his colleagues to leave Garibaldi's personality
       largely intact, and to accentuate his natural sense of paranoia
       and distrust. Garibaldi's resignation was an unexpected bonus that
       put him in a perfect position to infiltrate Edgars' organization.
       Garibaldi's mission was to gather information about the threat to
       the Psi Corps if the opportunity arose, then signal Bester.
     * Bester has removed Garibaldi's programming, leaving him with full
       memory of what was done to him and what he's done to Sheridan.
     * Bester's people have murdered Edgars and Wade and may have taken
       the virus. Lise's whereabouts are unknown.
     * The Corps has engaged in clandestine operations in the past. While
       Lyta was interning with the Psi Cops ([27]"Divided Loyalties")
       someone started murdering telepaths. The Corps engaged in illegal
       scans of civilians, and eventually found the killer. Rather than
       simply kill him, they twisted his mind. According to Lyta, he's
       now in a cell in a secret facility on Beta 2, straitjacketed 24
       hours a day to keep him from clawing out his own eyes to stop the
       nightmare visions only he can see.
     * The Corps has gone even further with the establishment of
       "bloodhound units," special undercover detachments of the Earth
       military who are accompanied by telepaths. Their mission is to
       perform random scans of the public and arrest any members of the
       resistance they come across.
     * Lyta believes there's likely to be a war between telepaths and
       mundanes some day, when word of such operations gets out and the
       trust the Corps has managed to build up evaporates as a result.
       
Unanswered Questions

     * Where is Lise?
     * What does Bester plan to do with the virus, assuming he has it?
     * Does Franklin know the full extent of Sheridan's plans for the
       frozen telepaths, and can he carry them out with Sheridan out of
       the picture?
     * Why didn't Franklin detect Garibaldi's false tooth during his
       medical exams?
     * Now that Ivanova is leading the fleet, will she continue her Voice
       of the Resistance broadcasts?
     * Is the Agamemnon's defection to the resistance what it seems?
       
Analysis

     * The resolution of the battle between Sheridan and Clark's forces
       points out what may be Sheridan's most potent weapon against
       Clark: not White Stars or superior strategy, but the presence of
       previously loyal human commanders who lend credibility to the
       rebel cause.
     * The White Stars appear to have adapted to Earth's weapons; a hit
       from an Earth heavy cruiser only disables a White Star until the
       auto-repair systems come online. Even without the defection of so
       many Earth ships, Ivanova is in command of an unstoppable military
       force.
     * Sheridan told the Agamemnon's captain that the rebel forces had
       lost some battles, but had kept the news to themselves. ("We've
       lost a few. We just made damned sure nobody heard about it.") How
       is that possible? Wouldn't Clark jump at the chance to spread news
       of victory over Sheridan's forces? And for that matter, would
       Ivanova participate in covering up any losses, given her
       insistence on telling the truth in her Voice of the Resistance
       broadcasts? ([28]"Rumors, Bargains and Lies")
       Perhaps Sheridan simply has a more specific definition of
       "victory" than most other people. He didn't seem to consider the
       outcome of the Proxima 3 battle a victory ([29]"No Surrender, No
       Retreat") so perhaps he'd consider it a loss if he wound up having
       to fight Clark's forces to the death.
       Or maybe Sheridan wasn't referring to his current campaign, but
       was speaking in general of his military career.
     * Sheridan demonstrated a lack of caution in this episode, first
       going over to the Agamemnon on a moment's notice (it could easily
       have been sent by Clark as a trap) then agreeing to go to Mars by
       himself. He even walked straight into a public place without
       attempting to obscure his face, which has no doubt been featured
       daily on ISN. That can be seen as evidence of what Garibaldi
       referred to as a "God complex" -- Sheridan appears to have
       disregarded his own fallibility.
       It's possible that this stems in part from the glimpse of his own
       future in [30]"War Without End, Part Two," which might lead
       Sheridan to believe that no matter what he does now, he'll be
       alive and free in 17 years.
     * Sheridan's capture was similar to G'Kar's in [31]"Whatever
       Happened to Mr. Garibaldi?" Both of them left a place of relative
       safety to try to rescue someone they cared about, and both were
       captured by a regime that was oppressing their people. Both were
       tortured after capture.
     * The Agamemnon, according to its captain, had been modified to
       track Sheridan's forces down. What, specifically, were the
       modifications? And more importantly, how likely is it that Clark
       would equip a ship specifically to seek Sheridan out without being
       very sure of its loyalty?
       The Agamemnon would make a perfect plant. Clark's people might
       have figured that Sheridan's emotional attachment to it would
       likely prompt him to put it in a position of trust, all the better
       to sabotage Sheridan's efforts at a critical juncture. Of course,
       Ivanova isn't biased toward trusting the Agamemnon, but at the
       time the Agamemnon was sent out to find the rebel fleet, Clark had
       no idea Sheridan's capture was imminent.
       Its arrival just after the battle was also very convenient; its
       captain could claim to be joining up with the rebels without
       actually having to fire on Clark's forces. If it had indeed been
       chasing after Sheridan for weeks, emerging from hyperspace at just
       that moment was quite a coincidence.
     * Was the Agamemnon's captain the one in command when it fired on
       the White Star? ([32]"Messages From Earth")
     * The Agamemnon has been involved in skirmishes with raiders near
       Io. Who are the raiders? Are the Drakh ([33]"Lines of
       Communication") encroaching on Earth's territory? Or are the
       raiders simply opportunists out to take advantage of Sheridan's
       campaign and its likely effect of drawing Earth forces away from
       their home system?
     * The Shadows were apparently right about Ivanova; she is indeed
       taking Sheridan's place, just as Bester says they feared.
     * Bester's manipulation of Garibaldi was foreshadowed in [34]"Dust
       to Dust." Bester told Garibaldi, "I enjoyed working with you. We
       made a good team. Perhaps we'll do it again sometime."
       It was also foreshadowed, if obliquely, in [35]"Divided
       Loyalties," in which Garibaldi _pretended_ to have a personality
       implant, if only as a joke.
       And before then, ironically, in [36]"The Quality of Mercy," Talia
       and Garibaldi shared a moment of mutual foreshadowing when she
       said to him, "Things that live inside us, Mr. Garibaldi. Terrible
       things. Terrible."
     * Bester referred to the Corps as "my telepaths." This echoes his
       comment to Ivanova in [37]"Ship of Tears" that he had plans for
       Earth's telepaths and didn't want the Shadows interfering.
       Apparently he considers himself responsible for Earth's telepaths,
       even if he's not officially in charge of the Corps.
     * Did Bester's people get the virus? It's possible Lise took it when
       she fled Edgars' compound. She wanted Garibaldi to help her stop
       him, and taking the virus would be a big step in that direction.
       Of course, that's assuming she could get to it; the Psi Cops could
       presumably take control of Edgars and force him to use the
       handprint reader, but Lise would have had a harder time getting to
       the vials.
       Garibaldi did see blast marks around the secret compartment,
       though, suggesting that it was opened by force.
     * The ISN broadcast showed investigators picking up a necklace from
       the floor of Edgars' residence. That necklace, or one like it, was
       being worn by Lise when she listened in on Edgars' conversation
       with Garibaldi, suggesting she was in the room after Edgars and
       Garibaldi left.
     * Bester's supposition that the virus was developed with the help of
       Shadow technology is consistent with the courier's claim in
       [38]"Conflicts of Interest" that coming up with the cure was a job
       beyond the capabilities of Earth's biologists, and that alien help
       had been enlisted.
     * If Bester is right about the Shadows helping create the virus, it
       means Edgars was in contact with the Shadows, even if indirectly.
       And indeed, Edgars and Wade seemed to espouse something like the
       Shadow philosophy: the enslavement of normals by telepaths or vice
       versa was a natural consequence of evolution.
     * References to the Nazis abound: Edgars described his plan as a
       solution to "the telepath problem," an echo of Hitler's "Jewish
       problem." Bester told Garibaldi that he had just prevented a
       Holocaust. Edgars even referred to the Nazis directly, though he
       misspoke a date; he claimed they came to power in 1939, but in
       fact Hitler was appointed Chancellor in 1933.
     * Garibaldi's line about the last person with his job being paid 30
       pieces of silver is a [39]Biblical reference. Judas was paid 30
       pieces of silver to betray Jesus to the Romans. Even under the
       influence of his altered personality, Garibaldi apparently has
       moral qualms about betraying Sheridan.
     * After Edgars told Garibaldi the full extent of his plans, Wade
       told Garibaldi he wouldn't be allowed to leave Edgars' compound.
       The implication was that any passing telepath (e.g. one of the
       "bloodhound units") would be able to scan Garibaldi and learn
       about the virus.
       Why, then, was Wade allowed to travel to Babylon 5, and stay there
       to recruit Garibaldi? Was Wade unaware of the big picture until
       his return to Mars? The laboratory scene near the end of [40]"The
       Exercise of Vital Powers" doesn't give the impression that Wade
       just found out what Edgars was up to; he seemed to have witnessed
       similar experiments in the past.
       Perhaps Wade was drugged or brainwashed in some way that made him
       more difficult to scan or that caused him to believe the story he
       told Garibaldi in [41]"Conflicts of Interest."
     * Bester's release of Garibaldi was, in some ways, an act of
       arrogance; in essence, Bester was saying that he didn't consider
       Garibaldi a threat. Given Garibaldi's determination in the past,
       he'll likely seek revenge or justice, and he won't rest until he
       has it.
     * Despite Bester's apparently accurate warning that Garibaldi's old
       comrades wouldn't want to have anything to do with him any more,
       Garibaldi did try to get in touch with Babylon 5. How will he be
       able to prove his story to them, and prove that he's no longer
       under Bester's influence? One obvious answer is to submit to a
       scan by Lyta, whose Vorlon-enhanced powers appear to far exceed
       Bester's. She would easily be able to verify Garibaldi's story,
       and her word might be enough to convince the others.
       Edgars' order to Garibaldi to fire Lyta ([42]"Moments of
       Transition") may, ironically, have been his downfall. If Edgars
       hadn't forced Garibaldi to get rid of her, she might have
       eventually detected Bester's handiwork and removed it, and Edgars
       would still be alive.
     * Why didn't Edgars release the virus? What was he waiting for? In
       [43]"The Exercise of Vital Powers," he seemed satisfied that the
       virus worked, and even asked that a test of its effectiveness be
       terminated.
       Since his aim was to control the telepaths, not simply wipe them
       out, perhaps he needed to wait until he had enough of the cure
       manufactured to supply to millions of victims.
       Edgars said he was waiting for Clark to drop his guard, but it's
       not clear what difference that would have made; Clark's level of
       paranoia would presumably have little effect on the spread of the
       virus and the demise of the telepaths.
     * Edgars' plans didn't amount to anything in the end. He was the
       only known credible threat to the Psi Corps. Now that he's dead
       and the Corps has control of his weapon against them, and Ivanova
       is continuing the rebel advance even in the face of Sheridan's
       capture, Edgars' fear of Clark panicking and giving increasing
       amounts of control to the Psi Corps may well become a reality.
       Of course, Sheridan may have anticipated that problem, and the
       frozen telepaths may be his answer.
     * In [44]"The Exercise of Vital Powers," Edgars implied that there
       were other powerful megacorps dissatisfied with Clark, and that
       his company was one of several planning to move against the
       government. Will any of the others act now that Edgars is out of
       the picture?
     * The problem may have gotten even worse thanks to Edgars: if the
       Corps has the virus, they'll presumably spend a good deal of
       effort studying it. The virus selects its victims via the presence
       of the telepathy genes. Developing that selectivity from scratch
       may have required the aid of the Shadows, but it might not be
       beyond Earth's biotechnology to use it as a blueprint and produce
       a modified version that selects for the _lack_ of the telepathy
       gene -- thus giving the Corps the same power over normals that
       Edgars wanted to gain over telepaths.
       Or the Corps could use the virus to cement its own control over
       all human telepaths. By releasing the virus and only giving the
       cure to members of the Corps, they'd eliminate the problem of
       rogue telepaths overnight. Latent telepaths like Ivanova would no
       longer be able to hide themselves from the Corps.
     * Bester could possibly also use the virus on Lyta; death by the
       virus might be considered natural causes under the terms of her
       contract ([45]"Moments of Transition.") Of course, such an
       operation would be very risky, since Lyta would be contagious.
     * Assuming Edgars kept detailed personnel records, the police will
       most likely look to Garibaldi as a prime suspect in the murders.
       Lise might also be a suspect. Both of them disappeared suddenly at
       the time of the murder, and given their past history, the police
       might conclude that Edgars' murder was a crime of passion
       committed by two old lovers who wanted to be together again.
     * The bloodhound units may have been in evidence before this
       episode. In [46]"Conflicts of Interest," the two telepaths chasing
       Garibaldi, Wade and Lise seemed to fit the description pretty
       well. And, more speculatively, they could have been the ones to
       plant the Keeper on Captain Jack in [47]"Racing Mars," since they
       presumably would have had little trouble learning of his personal
       association with Number One.
     * Lyta's description of the Corps' treatment of the murderer is
       strikingly similar to her threat to Londo in [48]"Passing Through
       Gethsemane." Perhaps she was present when the murderer was
       implanted and knows firsthand how to do such things. Maybe she was
       even involved in the process; that could be the secret about her
       Bester threatened to reveal in [49]"Epiphanies."
     * Number One said that when Lyta passed through Mars a year and a
       half earlier ([50]"Divided Loyalties") she made no mention of
       being a telepath on the run from the Corps. That's inconsistent
       with Lyta's story in that episode. She told Sheridan and the
       others at that time that she'd been helping out the resistance,
       and implied that they'd hired her for her telepathic skills.
     * Number One apparently really _does_ treat all her former lovers
       like she treated Phillipe ([51]"Lines of Communication.")
       
Notes

     * Harlan Ellison has a cameo appearance in this episode. He's the
       Psi Cop Bester instructs to alter Garibaldi's personality.
     * Bester's parting salute to Garibaldi, "Be seeing you," is a
       reference to the 60s TV show "The Prisoner." Bester first used the
       salute in [52]"Mind War."
     * Garibaldi is now missing a molar.
     * The appearance of the Agamemnon contradicts the attack scene at
       the end of [53]"Moments of Transition," in which the Agamemnon can
       be seen attacking civilian targets. However, as JMS noted in
       response to comments on that episode, the use of the Agamemnon was
       a slipup on the part of the production team.
     * The Cadmus, the ship that surrendered to Sheridan and MacDougan,
       is named after a mythological hero. Cadmus slew a dragon, and when
       he sowed the dragon's teeth, a race of warriors sprang from the
       ground.
     * This is the series' second attack on someone using a skin tab. The
       first was the poisoning of Kosh in [54]"The Gathering."
     * The Sheridan fight scene, shot in slow motion, was interspersed by
       editor David Foster with shots taken by still photographer Byron
       Cohen, who does most of the B5 publicity stills sent out to TV
       stations.
     * The shot of Garibaldi shown on the ISN broadcast is from the
       season-three opening credits.
       
jms speaks

     * I agree that it's probably one of the best we've done. I've now
       watched it at least a dozen times in finished form, and it still
       works for me.
     * One thing I've been doing with the latter part of season 4 is to
       experiment a little more, try different things. I feel that we
       need to push visually to try new things, the sort of visual
       techniques you don't see much in SF-TV, which for the most part is
       fairly prosaic as these things go. And to push the writing, to try
       some things that may succeed, or may fail, but you learn something
       either way. In its way, next week's ep is just as experimental,
       but in a very different direction.
       Mike Vejar definitely did a great job with this episode.
     * Zimbalist did a great job for us...he took huge gobs of exposition
       and not only delivered them, he made them interesting.
     * _Was he a fan of the show?_
       Nope, just figured he'd be great for the job, and cast him without
       audition. He didn't know anything about the show before that.
     * _What was the shimmering wall Sheridan stood near on the White
       Star bridge?_
       Those were the autorepair systems at work.
     * ""The Face of the Enemy" might represent the flipside of young
       Delenn's claim in "Atonement" that the most dangerous enemy is the
       one you know nothing about. Now the face of the enemy is the one
       you know all too well, one which you take for granted until it's
       revealed that the face is actually a mask."
       Yep. It's one thing facing implacable, vast enemies...it's quite
       another when you friend betrays you. That's personal.
     * There isn't that much direct, personal violence in the show. My
       feeling is that if you do that a lot, it loses any potential for
       impact. You only pull out that card when you really need it, to
       best effect...don't waste it. It's like harsh language, after
       you've heard someone going on using all the more remarkable
       Anglo-Saxon words for a while, it loses all impact.
     * "I thought the fight was a bit too long for much the same reason
       as you. All I can suggest is that John's metabolism isn't "normal"
       any more, and perhaps this had an effect. (And maybe the bullyboys
       were doing less damage than we think, simply to prolong the
       "fun".)"
       1) It was for dramatic/stylistic effect. Not everything done with
       some style has to have a scientific explanation.
       2) Having been mugged myself, time expands and slows down.
       3) It's the TV cliche that fights are over in a second. Ask anyone
       who's ever been in a real knock-down fight. It goes on a heck of a
       lot longer than we showed here. When I got mugged it went on for
       10 minutes.
       One of the ironies in other messages on this (not this one here
       specifically) is that some have noted the fast-paced editing,
       which is supposedly associated with music video/short attention
       span material...and then turn around and say it wasn't over fast
       enough.
     * _Was Lyta's story the secret from her past alluded to by Bester in
       [55]"Epiphanies?"_
       No, Franklin's comment to Lyta didn't involve her past, though we
       will find out more about that in a bit.
     * _Was Bester's salute a "Prisoner" reference?_
       Nope, not a Prisoner homage at all, in any way.
     * _Why mess Edgars' place up so thoroughly?_
       They wanted it to look like it was done by the Resistance; too
       much "attention" to his death would've drawn attention to the
       Corps.
     * Wade specificially says Lise wasn't there when they got back, so
       that eliminates her from the scenario.
     * _Why haven't the other races had conflict between their telepaths
       and their normals?_
       Obviously some, like the Minbari, dealt with it more easily than
       others; and in some places it came through Vorlon interference,
       while in others it came about naturally.
     * "Wade had a great line about the clash of homo sapiens and
       Neanderthals in Carthage. Was this line inspired by some of the
       recent Neanderthal finds? Or was this part of your orignial
       conception for the story?"
       Not recent stuff, just a general knowledge of this area.
       "Did Edgars really believe the Earthgov propaganda that Sheridan
       was operating under the malignant influence of aliens?
       Nope.
       "Is Bester really done with Garibaldi?"
       For the moment.
       "One of the captains of the Earth vessels is named Leo Frank. Was
       this a deliberate historical reference?"
       Not intentionally.
       "Franklin and Number One seem to have cooled their relationship.
       Any further developments in the works here?"
       Any more personal stuff got set aside when Franklin showed up a)
       with another female, and b) she was a teep. When #1 calms down,
       they might take another shot at it.
       "Lastly, there is a bit of irony in the fact that the stage for
       Sheridan's capture is set when he steps aboard his old ship, the
       Agamemnon. Agamemnon was the supreme commander of the Greek forces
       at Troy, who survived that long war, but who was betrayed and
       murdered by his wife when he returned home. He blindly and
       arrogantly stepped into a trap, as Sheridan also seemed to do."
       Yeah...that's one of many reasons why I picked that
       image/reference. It plays on a LOT of levels in the story.
     * _Wasn't Edgars' complex guarded to keep people from leaving
       without permission?_
       If anybody could slip away, Garibaldi could.
     * _Ivanova quoted Sheridan as saying, "The person is expendable. The
       job is not." But in fact, it was Sinclair who said that, in
       [56]"War Without End."_
       But then, if I did everything perfectly, wouldn't it be boring?
