Backplot

     * Minbari clans are like close-knit families. One surrenders some of
       one's identity to the clan, and in return the clan is expected to
       shoulder the responsibility for one's actions. Despite this, clan
       leaders sometimes engage in secret plots without the knowledge of
       the clan members at large.
     * Sheridan's tactics in the Earth-Minbari War (cf. [19]"Points of
       Departure") are considered completely without honor by many
       Minbari; he used a fake distress signal to lure the Black Star
       into a minefield.
     * Vir was considered a failure by his family. He was sent to Babylon
       5 at their behest, mostly to get him out of their hair. There was
       little competition for the post, which was thought to be something
       of a joke.
       
Unanswered Questions

     * What was Sheridan supposed to learn from Kosh's lesson? (see
       [20]Analysis)
     * How did Kosh know what Sheridan would find in the chamber?
     * Who were the people living there?
     * Will Vir's family take him up on Londo's offer?
     * What fate awaits the teddy bear?
     * Who was the human who stole Sheridan's link? Did he have an
       ulterior motive for helping with the setup, or was he simply doing
       it for money?
       
Analysis

     * Considering her dramatic entrance, Sheridan's lawyer didn't
       actually do much of anything. Who sent her, and what was she
       supposed to be doing for Sheridan?
     * One interpretation of Kosh's lesson is that he was teaching
       Sheridan to give humanity the benefit of the doubt. Even in what
       Sheridan considered the most dangerous, nasty place on the
       station, one can find beauty. If Kosh's pledge in [21]"Hunter,
       Prey" to teach Sheridan "about _you_" is taken broadly to mean
       "about your kind," this is at least a plausible scenario.
     * Another possible interpretation: Going to the darkest, dingiest,
       "worst part" of B5 was an analogy to Sheridan's current very "bad"
       situation. This is partly confirmed by Kosh's statement that
       having a "bad day" was perfectly appropriate for the lesson he had
       planned. What Sheridan saw there was "beauty... in the dark",
       which was exactly what he needed. He was obviously relaxed and
       feeling much better after the experience, and he thanked Kosh for
       helping him.
       The lesson? When things are at their absolute worst, don't simply
       satisfy your basic needs (eating, sleeping), take time out to
       enjoy something that will make you feel better despite the
       conditions. It will help you deal with adversity. Alternatively,
       the lesson is that even in some of the worst places/situations,
       there can still be beauty if you allow yourself to look for it.
     * Why the monastic chant? Sheridan said in [22]"Points of Departure"
       that he had met the Dalai Lama in Tibet. The chant wasn't Tibetan
       -- it is a Gregorian chant, part of the Christmas Mass. The entire
       incident may have been projected into Sheridan's mind by Kosh or
       by someone else. The fact that Sheridan could see it might also be
       related to his dream in [23]"All Alone in the Night."
       The Latin lyrics:
       
     Puer natus est nobis et filius datus est nobis;
     cujus imperium super humerum ejus;
     et vocabitur nomen ejus,
     consilii Angelus.
     
     Cantate Domino canticum novum;
     quia mirabilia fecit.
       One English translation of which is:
       
     Unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given;
     on whose shoulders the world's dominion rests;
     whose name is;
     He who was sent to us from the great Heavenly Wonder-Counselor.
     
     Sing unto the Lord a new song. He has made wonders.
       There are two quotes here, one from Isaiah 9:6, the other from
       Psalm 98:1:
       
     For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the
     government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called
     Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The
     Prince of Peace.
       
     O sing unto the Lord a new song; for he hath done marvellous
     things: his right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the
     victory.
       Whether this particular chant has any bearing on the story, or was
       just selected because it sounds good, is an interesting question,
       but a couple rather tenuous connections can be made:
       The second verse mentions a "hand" being victorious; recall that
       Sheridan was told, "You are the hand," in [24]"All Alone in the
       Night."
       The fourth issue of the [25]comic series, dealing with Sinclair's
       appointment to the Minbari homeworld, is titled "The Price of
       Peace," one letter removed from the description of Jesus above.
       (That one is probably just a coincidence.)
     * It's also worth comparing Kosh's lessons to his encounter with
       Talia in [26]"Deathwalker." When she asked what his negotiations
       meant, he advised her to "listen to the music, not the words" --
       advice that might apply to Sheridan's lesson as well.
     * The plight of the teddy bear mirrors the story Sheridan told to
       Delenn; if the bear is really supposed to represent Sheridan, is
       its fate perhaps a foreshadowing of Sheridan's?
       
Notes

     * Londo's mention of "a certain Minbari" lying is probably a
       reference to Lennier's lie in [27]"The Quality of Mercy."
     * The Centauri expect their dolls to be anatomically correct.
     * "Honour and shame from no condition rise;
       Act well your part, there all the honour lies."
       - Alexander Pope, "An Essay on Man" Epistle IV, 1733-34
     * Possible Ranger sighting: When Vir and Londo are talking in the
       Zocalo, a man in what looks like a Ranger uniform walks by twice.
       Once as Vir says, "Centauri Prime is sending a replacement," and
       again as he says, "It's my problem, not yours."
     * The bear is from the [28]Vermont Teddy-Bear Company. It's a
       "twenty inch" with "JS" embroidered on the front and "Ba-bear-lon
       5" on the back. Peter David says:
       
     Specifically, on page 13 of their 1994 Winter Collection Catalogue,
     they have the Custom Embroidered Bears. Ordered with a baseball
     shirt and hat (NOT jacket), he's 20 inches high and his fur color
     is 'Pockets (thick milk chocolate)'...
     
     I should point out that ordering the bear for Joe was my wife's
     idea. She's a big bear fan. At present she's hard at work on a
     Min_bear_i...
       
jms speaks

     * So after I'd read Peter's script, and decided to go with it, he
       asked about Ivanova's line, "This isn't some kind of Deep Space
       franchise, this place is ABOUT something."
       "Are you really going to use that?" he asked.
       "Absolutely," I said. "It's fall-down funny."
       Long pause. "You people really ARE dangerous over there, aren't
       you?"
     * No, the scene in the dark with the robed figures was not enhanced
       with CGI or any other device.
     * Everything featured in the Babylon Emporium was just made up by
       us. Insofar as I know, none of it is real merchandise. (Everyone,
       including the crew, are so starved for B5 stuff that when we
       finished filming the ep, we sold off the stuff, at cost, to those
       in the crew who wanted them. Two guesses who wound up with the
       Londo and G'Kar dolls....)
     * The B5 model in the gift shop in "Honor" is now in Sheridan's
       office, bronzed, as is his right as captain.
       Once the show is finally off the air, be assured that the model
       will end up in THIS captain's office.
     * Here's the story of the bear.
       I hate cute. Everybody knows me, knows that. So after buying Peter
       David's script #2, Peter sends me a gift. A bear. A teddy bear.
       With my initials JS in front, and Bear-ba-lon 5 in the back. I
       call Peter back. I say that I must now get him for this. He asks
       what I had in mind. I said wait and see.
       So I wrote the entire bear thing at the end of the show, and
       inserted it into his script.
       Never send me something cute.
       Best part was during filming, we shot the bear against blue-screen
       to be composited into the CGI. And there's our EFX supervisor,
       standing there on film, against blue-screen, with this long rod up
       the teddy bear's ass, spinning it round and round and round....
       Whilst doing that, I also wrote and inserted the Kosh/Perfect
       Beauty scenes, since I was already in it at that point anyway, and
       I figured it'd be cool.
       It also keeps the Sheridan Learning Stuff thread going, and works
       in a nice balance to the rest of the episode. Here he's going
       nuts, being harrassed, and his command is on the line...so he has
       to learn to bend his knee, accept silence, give up his command
       symbolically by giving up the stat bar, and finding one perfect
       moment of peace.
     * Yes, Kosh asking Sheridan "what is this place?" was more for his
       benefit than Kosh's, to underline where they were, and what he was
       about to experience even in such a place. Also, in
       psychotheraputic terms, specifically dream analysis, when you
       travel to your cellar in your dream, it's in part to confront
       something in your subconscious, to learn something that may not be
       expressable in words.
     * Yes, he did send a fake distress call, and took out the Black Star
       when it came in to (they thought) wipe out a disabled ship. He's
       never denied this to anybody.
     * Sheridan sent an EA distress signal; the Minbari were in genocidal
       mode, so it didn't matter to them the condition of their enemy.
