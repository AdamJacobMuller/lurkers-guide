Bruce Boxleitner on Prodigy, 08/12/97


Moderator (Speaker)
Hi folks...Thanks for joining us... We're about to begin live with
Bruce Boxleitner!

Moderator (Speaker)
Ok let's get started!

Moderator (Speaker)
He's been an American Army captain in turn of the century Russia,
a intergalactic war hero turned diplomat, even a Scarecrow! Please
help us welcome BRUCE BOXLEITNER!!!

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
Hi everyone at Prodigy. I hope you have some fine questions,
because I'm ready and prepared for you!

Moderator (Speaker)
Thanks for being here Bruce!

Moderator (Speaker)
Let's get right to some questions..First us is Dak 8...

Dak 8 (Prodigy Member)
how has TV changed since your stint on "Scarecrow" in the 80s?

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
The old saying, the more things change, the more they stay the
same. The kind of programming has changed quite a bit. The making
of television has changed quite a bit. Now you have to do them n
cheaper budgets. It's gotten much more businesslike since then. Lot
less of a family type of feeling on a TV series. An they don't give
you as much of a chance to find an audience. A show needs time to
find an audience, and they're very quick to pull them off the air
now.

Moderator (Speaker)
Bruce Boxleitner stars on the hit WB series "Babylon 5." As Captain
John Sheridan, a war hero turned diplomat at the helm of Earth
Alliance Station Space Station, Bruce has been honored as Sci-Fi
Universe Magazine Reader's Choice Best Actor in a TV Series in both
1995 (he shared the award with David Duchovny of "The X-Files") and
1996.

Avatar32 (Prodigy Member)
Do you think that Sheridan truly had a god complex, or was it all
an act, in order to "rally the troops" in their fight against
Earth?

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
I don't think he had a God complex as much as his fight against
earth became an obsession and I think he felt it was absolutley his
destiny.

Lydil (Prodigy Member)
Mr. Boxleitner, how do you feel working in a series where the
ending has already been filmed, and you know the outcome?

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
Well, since I shot the last episode and know how it ends, I feel
good. It was a terrific ending. Quite a beautiful ending.

Moderator (Speaker)
During the fall of 1995, Bruce co-starred with his real-life wife,
Melissa Gilbert, in NBC's adaption of Danielle Steele's "Zoya."
Bruce starred as an American Army captain who falls for Russian
Zoya. The plot of the mini-series spanned 60 years. Melissa also
starred, of course, in the long-running "Little House on the
Prairie"... Hence, the next question...

Dak 8 (Prodigy Member)
Ever find yourself watching old repeats of Little House? Does it
creep you out at all? :)

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
No, they don't creep me out at all. I think she was cute.

CRhino (Prodigy Member)
How was the transition, both publicly [media] & privately
[crew/cast] between the change from you & the previous captain?

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
Everyone was very open to me and very warm and receptive and very
professional. I had no problems whatsoever walking into the part.
The die-hard fans at first were kind of skeptical, which I
understand, but I feel they've accepted me very well. So I have no
problem.

swimguy (Prodigy Member)
Tell us about how Babylon 5 came back from dead... I had heard it
was canceled.

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
It was on the brink of being canceled when TNT came like the
cavalry in the last reel of an old western and saved the day. It's
difficult to give any one reason why. There were several to why it
was near cancellation--financial, the joining of TNT and Time
Warner... it might have fallen through the cracks. But we were
saved because we had such good fans. TNT bought it and you can
thank them. So we can continue the saga, which begins again in
January.

Wild Bean (Prodigy Member)
Where is Babylon 5 filmed?

 
Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
In the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles.

Lord Monarch (Prodigy Member)
How were you picked for the part of John Sheridan?

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
Basically, I knew the producers from working with them previously.
They called my agents and asked me if I would meet with them and
consider the part. They sent me some scripts and I took it from
there.

Wild Bean (Prodigy Member)
How did you get into the acting business and how old were you??

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
I started in high school and then I went onto professional training
after that. I started acting professionally at age 19. My first big
part on TV was on "How the West Was Won," with James Arness. By the
way, the show is run on TNT constantly.

Moderator (Speaker)
Bruce and the other member of the cast of "Babylon 5" recently
graced the cover of TV Guide, highlighting the Summer Sci-Fi
Special issue. "B-5" will soon move to TNT for its fifth season,
starting with two new two-hour films. And speaking of the TNT
movies...

Lord Monarch (Prodigy Member)
Could you tell us a little about Babylon 5: In the Beginning?

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
It is basically the story of the Earth-Minbari war. That was the
seminal event in each of the characters' lives on the show. We see
where the various characters were during that conflict.

BettyBoobs2 (Prodigy Member)
How is your marriage to Melissa Gilbert?

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
Wonderful!

CRhino (Prodigy Member)
If Delen were to be represented by a human actress, what
nationality would be the best fit?

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
She is acted by a human actress, and she's Yugoslavian.

libra79 (Prodigy Member)
Hello! I enjoyed your TV special "Zoya." I thought it was great! I
enjoyed seeing you and your wife working together. Is there any
chance of you two working together again? I would really enjoy
seeing that.

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
Whenever we can find a good story, we love to work together and we
certainly want to do it again.

RageGrrl (Prodigy Member)
Yo Bruce! What color socks do you have on?

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
I'm not wearing any at the moment.

Moderator (Speaker)
Ah ha! :)

thevelvetfog (Prodigy Member)
Hi Bruce! What has been your reaction to the passion and dedication
of sci-fi fans? Do you ever feel like William Shatner on Saturday
Night Live ("get a life!")? : )

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
I would only say that jokingly. I appreciate their devotion,
because the fans have been so important to keeping our show alive.

Here's a great question from Dak 8...

Dak 8 (Prodigy Member)
If you were a candy bar, what kind would you be?

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
Almond Joy.

Avatar32 (Prodigy Member)
After filming the episode "Intersections in Real Time," will you
ever look at corned beef sandwiches in the same way?

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
I haven't had one since.

swimguy (Prodigy Member)
How have you been enjoying your stint in the Sci-fi world?

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
I've been loving it. For me, it was like a whole new direction in
my acting career, and I'm taking on another direction by
co-authoring a science fiction novel for Berkeley Press which
hopefully will come out this year. It will be along the lines of
Shatner's TekWar novels, and it's not Babylon 5 at all.

Lord Monarch (Prodigy Member)
What was it like working with your wife, in the last episode of
Season 3?

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
I enjoy working with Melissa a great deal. We're always looking for
projects to do together. I was happy to have her do the show,
because she doesn't normally do episodic unless she's starring, and
I was very happy with the results.

CallMeLarry (Prodigy Member)
Bruce, what is it like working for J. Michael Straczynski? He seems
like he likes to control everything... did this influence you at
all?

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
It's his show. He's the boss, and I do enjoy working with him. He's
a very creative man.

Delenn1 (Prodigy Member)
Mr. Boxleitner... I'm sure you get asked this question a lot, but
what's your all-time favorite episode of Babylon 5? Which one was
the most fun to make?

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
I have a few favorites. Zahadum, In the Shadow of Zahadum, and
Intersections in Real Time, and many more... those are just a few.

dobe7 (Prodigy Member)
Is it hard to take seriously the actors who are dressed in alien
costumes when you're arguing back and forth with them?

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
Sometimes.... But I'm used to them now.

swimguy (Prodigy Member)
What had you been planning on doing next when it looked like
Babylon 5 was going to be over?

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
I was in a state of shock, because I thought the show was pretty
popular. I didn't have any immediate plans. I was just going to see
what was out there and try to get something else going... If the
show had been canceled, hopefully I would have gotten some other
orders, but I don't have to worry about that now.

Avatar32 (Prodigy Member)
What is one thing that you know about John Sheridan that the
audience doesn't?

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
What color socks he wears.... that's my secret.

 
CallMeLarry (Prodigy Member)
Bruce, are there any plans for a Babylon 5 movie?

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
Yes, they have talked about it....but there's nothing concrete yet.

Delenn1 (Prodigy Member)
How is your son doing? Showing any acting potential yet? {g}

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
He's a little showman all right. He's showing signs of quite a
healthy two-year-old.

swimguy (Prodigy Member)
Who has been the weirdest alien you've encountered on the show?

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
The one called the Methane Breather. Or as I call him, Hose Nose.

spotter7 (Prodigy Member)
How do visitors to Babylon 5 rate on the psychological aura
presentation of Romans 1:20?

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
One would have to know the Bible for that....

Lydil (Prodigy Member)
Mr. Boxleitner, could you tell us about the B5 movie Thirdspace,
and what it entails for the B5 crew?

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
It is about the station's reaction to this giant, ancient artifact
that comes floating into our sector. You will learn how it relates
to the end of the shadow war.
 
Gravy Davy (Prodigy Member)
Hello Bruce, Are you and the whole Babylon 5 crew going to be in
some full length movies, and if so, how are these movies going to
tie in to the series? Sincerely, A fan
 
Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
Not everyone in the cast is in the B5 films, but they're pretty
spread out throughout both of them. The first one--a prequel, airs
in January.

SandyVanHew (Prodigy Member)
Hi Bruce! Not only am I a fan of B5,but of yours too. Did you do a
lot of your own stunts in How the West was Won?

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
Yes I did. I as much younger then.

Moderator (Speaker)
Bruce has also starred with Kenny Rogers and Loni Anderson in
"Gambler V: Playing For Keeps" (he's been featured in four of the
five "Gambler" movies), CBS's "Wyatt Earp: Return to Tombstone,"
"Double Jeopardy," "House of Secrets," and ABC's "Perfect Family."

dobe7 (Prodigy Member)
What are some of your favorite things?

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
Play with my kids, read a lot, ride my horses, and kick back.

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
With my beautiful wife.

bLaMmObOy (Prodigy Member)
the next time your on tv can you mention my name

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
Sure....

Moderator (Speaker)
I wonder how they're going to work blammoboy into the script...  :
)

RageGrrl (Prodigy Member)
What is your favorite magazine?

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
I have an eclectic tastes--High Frontier about NASA and the space
program, military and western history magazines and some of the
sci-fi magazines which cover our show, like Starburst, Starlog,
Sci-Fi Universe. I get them pretty reguarly.

Avatar32 (Prodigy Member)
I've noticed that Sheridan has a nasty habit of falling/jumping
from high places. ("The fall of Night", "Z'Ha'Dum").  Is there a
certain symbolism behind that, do you feel?  Something that gives
us a hint to the captain's eventual fate?

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
I think JMS could answer that better than I. That's a question I'm
always asking....

swimguy (Prodigy Member)
How will the new Babylon 5 episodes for TNT be different from the
syndicated ones?

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
I don't think there will be a difference. It will be a seamless
transition to TNT.

Where did you grow up and how were you discovered?

Wild Bean (Prodigy Member)
Do you often watch your acting on tv?

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
I watch The X-Files and Babylon 5 and the news. Fairly reguarly.

CRhino (Prodigy Member)
Mr. Boxleitner, what of Tron?  I suggest it is more applicable now
than in the 80's.

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
Certainly, because the computer and computer language was still not
as common as it is today. That's one of the reasons I believe Tron
wasn't as popular back then as it is today.

Lord Monarch (Prodigy Member)
 Is there a place on the net, where the fans can get info on the
stars of Babylon 5. E-mail addresses to ask questions? Or is there
just one E-mail address?

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
There are a zillion web sites....try www.babylon5.com

CallMeLarry (Prodigy Member)
Bruce, I have really enjoyed Babylon 5.  I thought you coming in as
a second captian was a mistake, but I was wrong... way wrong.  You
have the best Sci-Fi series by far.  So question, will you do any
more sci-fi?

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
Definetly.

Avatar32 (Prodigy Member)
Have you read any of the B5 books or comics?  If so, what do you
think of them?

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
I've read a few of the books and I think they're very interesting.

Lydil (Prodigy Member)
Mr. Boxleitner, what is in store for B5 in Season 5?  With many
plot lines tied up, can we expect bigger and better things in the
season to come?

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
More fun and excitement in outer space.

BruceBFan (Prodigy Member)
To you, what's the worst (most annoying) thing for a fan to do when
they meet you? And the best thing?

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
Sneeze in my face....

jedifire (Prodigy Member)
I've heard many things about how hard it is to work with green
screen/blue screen, do you often have to work with those systems
and interact with enviroments that don't exist around you, and how

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
I have to often yes, but I don't find them particuarly difficult.
An actor's job is to use his imagination and that's what's required
with blue screen.

Lydil (Prodigy Member)
Mr. Boxleitner, how do you compare a series that has a story arc,
like B5, compared to series where they do not have an arc?  Do you
prefer the arc, or non-arc?

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
I enjoy working period. I don't think there is much of a difference
in the two.

Cyber Rider (Prodigy Member)
Hi there Bruce...I like the show B5 alot...in my opinion, you give
Star Trek a run for the money. I believe it is the human
interaction which is good as well as killer effects, most excellent
computer aninm.   I'm really happy you got another season. I'd
really like to know, will B5 still be shown on UPN & will there be
another season after this one? I really hope so. Wish you the
best...Cy

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
Yes, beginning in January on TNT.

Mum5 (Prodigy Member)
Glad to hear about Babylon 5's renewal for season 5. Are you
planning on being in the spin-off, Crusades, if it gets picked up?

I hope to, yes.

I Am SheRa (Prodigy Member)

Spotter69 (Prodigy Member)
Are you cool?

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
Very.

Moderator (Speaker)
Great answer! And we agree...

CallMeLarry (Prodigy Member)
Bruce do you know if Babylon 5 will be released on video tape?  And
now that TNT owns the rights, is this a Ted Turner issue...

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
I know it will be eventually, but I don't know when.

BruceBFan (Prodigy Member)
Are you still planning on attending a convention in Philly over
Labor Day weekend? I hope so because I'm going just to see you!

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
I hope to, but I just recently learned that some of the payment
might not be in place and if they don't live up to their part of
the contract, I can;'t live up to mine.

ZINGn1 (Prodigy Member)
Why did you choose to be on this show?

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
Cause the money was good.

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
Just kidding....

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
I was intrigued by the character and the scripts.

CallMeLarry (Prodigy Member)
Bruce do you own a computer?  If so, what do you use it for?

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
Finding out what people think of our show....

Moderator (Speaker)
Cool! So watch yourself out there in cyberspace...

Lydil (Prodigy Member)
Mr. Boxleitner, how does Sheridan rate of all the characters you
have played?

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
He's up there as one of my favorites.

SandyVanHew (Prodigy Member)
Are you working on any projects besides B5?

Not at the moment. I can't do anything else while I'm doing B5,
contractually.

Jackson?  Any plans for a reunion movie?  If so, would you do it?

MikusBearus (Prodigy Member)
How does "Babylon 5" compare with "Buck Rogers"?  In terms of
writing, acting, expenses, intelligence.

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
I don't think Buck Rogers and Babylon 5 are comparable. Were two
different concepts.

cooldude5 (Prodigy Member)
how many seasons do you think/know Babylon 5 will last?

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
I think this 5th season and then I think certainly the spin-off
Crusade is very very possible and the saga can live on.

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
My wife has dinner on the table for me, so I've got to say so long.
I appreciate everyone and all your questions. So thanks for your
continued support of the show. We promise to do our very best to
