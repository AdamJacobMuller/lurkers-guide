Bruce-- I'm a big fan of both you and your wife... Did you meet 
Melissa while making a movie with her? If not, what were the 
circumstances?

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
No, we did not meet while making a movie. We lived in the same area, 
but didn't know that. I actually met her through a mutual friend. Our 
first date was when we went out to lunch.

Moderator (Speaker)
At the beginning of this year, Bruce married his leading lady Melissa 
Gilbert. On October 6, they welcomed to the world their first son, 
Michael Garrett. Michael, in fact, was named after the late actor

to the show.

Any chance of a Scarecrow/ Mrs. King reunion, given how many TV

It was talked about a few years ago but nothing has come up with it, 
unfortunately.

Moderator (Speaker)
Our next question comes from SamFelix3, another big fan of Bruce's 
current show...

SamFelix3 (PRODIGY Member)
The makeup in the Babylon 5 series is so outstanding, is it sometimes 
difficult or distracting to perform with actors who are so heavily 
made-up and costumed?

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
My first season, sometimes. Now, no.

Moderator (Speaker)
DID YOU KNOW? -- On October 28th in L.A., Bruce shared "Best Actor in 
a TV Series" honors with "X-Files" star David Duchovny at the Annual

Do you know if there are any plans to continue Babylon 5 after it 
completes its five year story line?

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
As of right now the five year saga will be it.

Moderator (Speaker)

Finky (PRODIGY Member)
Bruce, I'm on my husbands line but I wanted to get a question in 
without leaving the "room". I've been wondering if Joe Straczynsky is 
planning to expore, in more depth, the developing relationship 
between Ambassador De'lenn and Captain Sheridan?  It's an interesting 
story line.    I enjoy Babylon 5!!

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
Yes, the exploration continues. There are going to be some surprises.


Moderator (Speaker)
We've still got time for some more member questions for our guest 
Bruce Boxleitner...Keep submitting those queries!

Cord (PRODIGY Member)
Do you look forward to working with your predecessor, Michael O'Hare, 
in the up coming episode, "War Without End parts 1 & 2"?  (I think it 
will make for an interesting combination.)

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
Yes, very much so.

Snoopy JP (PRODIGY Member)
What kind of music do you listen to?

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
Eric Clapton, Bruce Springsteen, the New Rolling Stones "Stripped", 
(very very good) and the Beatles Anthology.

Maybe Bruce should log onto PRODIGY tomorrow night...We've got 
musician Billy Preston chatting! (Billy played on the Beatles' "Get

Snoopy JP (PRODIGY Member)
Now that you are in a regular series, are the summer time offers 
pouring in as agents "discover" you again?

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
Excuse me? (he laughs)

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
I will be busy again this summer, Yes.

Dark Raven 1 (PRODIGY Member)
B5 seems to have it's focus on the "human "element rather than a lot 
of flashy special effects. Was that one of the things that drew you 
to the role of Capt. Sheridan?

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
Yes, and I was interested in the fact that all the characters have 
interesting flaws which gave the stories a a reality.

S Pearl (PRODIGY Member)
I have a friend who calls Babylon 5 our last, best hope for good 
science fiction.  My question is, what do you think Ambassador Kosh 
really is?

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
Whatever your interpretation is, that is what he is.

Moderator (Speaker)

Star of the Year" in Germany and has fan clubs in England, Hong Kong,

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
The Great Maker, JMS, has hinted at the possibility...

Jagger1 (PRODIGY Member)
When are you going on the Howard Stern show again?

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
Not anytime soon, thank you.

mdmb (PRODIGY Member)
I was very interested with the introduction (or reintroduction) of 
the Narn, Ta'Lon.  He and Sheridan look as if they are at the 
beginning of a good friendship.  Can you let us know what, if any, 
further development in this is forthcoming this season?  I am 
especially interested in knowing if he really is going to become 
Sheridan's 'bodyguard' and how Earth will take that.

Bruce Boxleitner (Speaker)
At this time I cannot divulge that information.... under pain of 
death. <G>

am5 (PRODIGY Member)

having to fill the shoes of the previous commander, do you feel that

the chicken or the egg?
