The Babylon 5 Episode Guide for Apple Newton v0.5

Seeing how I got into B5 in the middle of the second season, there’s a lot 
I missed and probably will never see.  I wanted to have a copy of the 
Babylon 5 episode guide to take with me to read at any time.  The first 
version word for word matched the one on ftp.hyperion.com.  Problem was, it 
created a 2 megabyte package.  To trim it down, I needed to remove 
something and that something turned out to be the “jms speaks” section.  
Let me tell you, that was painful, but it was also the only real part that 
wasn’t required reading just to understand the episode.  I encourage 
everyone, though, to read the full guide.

This guide will have spelling mistakes and typos and formatting problems 
and what-not.  Let me know if you find anything glaring.  All credit should 
be given to the original authors of each episode’s guide...  I only 
compiled them into a Newton book.  Future versions of the book will include 
a table of contents for each episode and perhaps other information.

This program requires about 1 meg of free space on the Newton.  Huge?  
Perhaps.  Just wait until the series is finished!  If anyone is interested 
in the 2 meg, "let's fill up a PC-Card" complete version with the "jms 
speaks" section, let me know.

I would like to know if anyone is using this because if not, then its 
probably a waste of time trying to improve it.  It is, of course, freeware 
but I would like responses and comments directed towards 
Linger@starsys.mdn.com.  Enjoy!
