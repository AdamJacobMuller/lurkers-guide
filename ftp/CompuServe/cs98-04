      Kosh may have known that this moment would come, but knowing the
price that he would almost certainly have to pay...it wasn't easy, and
one can forgive Kosh for his outburst.  I think, in the end, he was
afraid, for a moment, a human thing...but he did what was necessary.

who've been waiting can catch up.

      See, here's what I don't understand in all this.

      It's not that the cast was let go, THE SHOW IS OVER.  You can
only "let go" of an actor if the show continues and the actor is out. 
THE SHOW IS OVER. I've been saying for five years, "This is a five year
story.  When it's over, it's over."

      I think part of the problem was that some in the cast didn't
want to ever deal with the reality of that until it hit them.  I read
many interviews where they said, "Well, Joe says it's a five year
story, but I don't see any reason why this can't go on."  If you
cushion yourself from it, then it can only hit you in the face later. 
(On the last few days of shooting, several people asked, "Why couldn't
it have been a *six* year arc?  Why the arbitrary five?"  It is what it
is.

      Toward the end of filming, we spoke to all the cast, apprised
them of the work progressing toward a feature film, the likelihood of
additional TV movies before then, and so on.  But we also said,
specifically, "Babylon 5 the series is over."

      But you must admit that it's quite a jump between "the series is
over" and "the actors were fired."  Technically speaking, EVERYONE is
fired when a show is over.

      As for Crusade, there are a couple of people who might
transition over, but that is *a different series*.  And must have its
own identity (should it go into production).  You maybe do one or two
B5 feature films, with the whole cast, as Crusade runs on a separate
track on TV.

      As for John Flinn...same situation.  John was the DP on B5 for
all five years, minus those episodes DPd by Fred Murphy.  Babylon 5 is
now over, and so that task is over.  Crusade (see previous disclaimer)
should have an entirely different look from B5, to make it its own
show, and that generally requires a different DP.  That's pretty much
standard in the business.

                                                                  jms

      Absolutely, there's no question that I'm going to be hit by
those with an interest in hitting me on any side of these issues. 
Crusade would be done because I want to have some *fun* after doing 5
years of angst...so there are bound to be those who say it's selling
out because it's not the same as B5 in that respect...if I have a
primarily new cast, I sold out the old cast, if I have a primarily old
cast, I'm being afraid of change...if it's too much like B5 some will
complain, if it's too different some will complain....

      Which is why, at the end of the day, you can never let the
complaints (or, for that matter, the praise) tilt you one way or
another.  The only thing you can do is follow the small, still voice at
the back of your head that tells the stories, and write for yourself. 
If you write well, enough people will stay around to keep you on the
air...if you don't, they won't. That's always struck me as the fairest
bargain around.

Subject: Season 6?

{original post had no questions}

      Vast amounts of your information are incorrect; WB owns B5, for
starters.  Additionally, TNT puts up a portion of the production
budget, WB puts up the rest, same as with any network show.  There was
some initial talk of a sixth season by some folks over there, but I
made it clear that this is a five year story, and it ends in five
years, and asked them to respect my wishes.  They did.

                                                                  jms

      It's not free-form, but it's not by the minute, either.  We have
an overall running time of about 42 minutes (plus credits), and that
gets divided into teaser, 4 acts and a tag.  The duration of those
varies; an act can be 8 minutes or 12, as long as the aggregate is
within the limits.

Subject: DS9 title ripoff

{original post unavailable}

      The phrase "A Call to Arms" goes back several centuries, and is
not owned by anyone, DS9 did not invent it.  You can only "rip off"
something that is specific to that item or thing; if they came up with
a title "Chief O'Brien's Hairdresser Dreedle," and we used that, then
you'd have a point. But this is, frankly, a case of fan myopia.

                                                                  jms

Subject: Crusade Confirmed

      Today the news hit: CRUSADE: THE BABYLON PROJECT (a new series
set in the B5 universe) is a go for production starting July 27th, to
go on the air January 6th on TNT.

      Also: if you can get a copy of tomorrow's Hollywood Reporter, do
so: they have dedicated the issue as a special B5 issue, and there is
going to be a lot of coverage of the show.  The issue will almost
certainly become a hard-to-find item in future, and is a testament to
the success not only of the show, but recognition within the industry
of what we've done to improve the way television is made.

      You can find the Reporter at many larger newsstands in big
cities.  And we won't get to any real casting until the first few
scripts are in-hand, so we know what we're getting into.

"With Neil Gaiman, it was obvious. You're a fan of his and vice versa,
but for other potential writers do you solicit resumes/writing
samples/outlines?"

      Usually, I know the writer's work, so it's just a matter of
getting them in and handing them a premise (or in some rare cases,
asking them to come up with a story pitch).  If it's someone whose work
I don't readily know -- and this is rare for me to do on a first
season, when I know that every episode has to kick -- I'll call the
person's agent and get some samples of their prior produced work.

      Since there are only 11 available slots for this season, that
doesn't leave a lot of room right off the bat, and I have about 6-7
writers in mind for the rest, so it's already close to being locked
down before we've even started.

                                                                  jms

      Thanks...and yeah, I want it to be as much on the edge as B5,
but in a slightly different way.  Why can't an SF show be as much on
the cutting edge in its storytelling as a Homicide or NYPD Blue?  So
I'm going to gradually start playing with the format, and see where it
takes me.  If it ain't gonna be better than what we did before, ain't
much point to doing it....

      I would like to, some time...my fantasy is having just one day,

beach...and I realized that it wasn't entirely just Londo talking.

      Nah...occasional wistfulness notwithstanding, I wouldn't have it
any other way.  Understand that I'm in the best position imaginable:
people are paying me for something I'd have to do for free, because I
can't not write. I get to write, and tell my stories my way, and make a
decent living.  How much more can anyone ask for?  And with all that,
it seems inappropriate to complain about the hours.

Subject: The Rock Cried Out

{original post unavailable}

      Rock is an old spiritual going back to the Civil War; the bar
song was developed by Chris Franke; and Byron's little ditty was
something I came up with.

      Some of the songs (as from Walkabout) are on the CDs.

                                                                  jms

      No, the shadows definitely didn't try their advancement routine
on the vorlons; they were cases of parallel evolution at similar
periods.

Subject: No more UK Fan Club ?

{original post unavailable}

      The UK fan club was never "official."  They were never a branch
of the official B5 fan club.  We do not have, and have never had, the
authority to convey official status to ANY outside fan group, only WB
can authorize such things through an official license.  We were
concerned in that the UK group was being perceived as such by fans
there, some of whom had begun sending us (and me) email with complaints
or general notes about the UK fan club asking me to deal with it since
this was an officially sanctioned fan club, so it became important to
clarify that.  You cannot "disenfranchise" someone or something that
was never a part of the "franchise" (a term I hate) in the first place.

                                                                  jms

      To my knowledge, I've never spoken with Mr. Long, so that kind

      I don't consider it a mistake at all...you never heard much of
other Psi Cops talking about Bester, and they would have more knowledge

officers above and below him liked him...and he scared the crap out of
others.  Same here.

      I'd say from the way that Sheridan replied -- "You didn't ask
where I stood during the big fight back home" "You're right, I didn't" -
 - the implication is there that he knows.

      Of his previous titles, I suggest SHATTERDAY, DEATHBIRD STORIES,
