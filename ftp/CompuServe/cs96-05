      Actually, what I'd said was that these 2-3 eps between big arcs
were NOT arc stories per se, but breathers.  Just to clarify....

      Thanks.  That's one of the things about the show that makes it
very appealing to write; you can go from fall down funny, broad comedy
in "Vir" to something more emotional, almost lyrical but serious in
"Avalon," then right into something vaguely horrific in "Ship."  You
get to use all your muscles, not just the same ones over and over.  I
like to stretch, try something I haven't tried before.  Which means
from time to time I fall on my face, but that's okay; it's the only way
to learn.  I have absolutely no qualms about making an ass of myself
and failing if it means that the next time, I can do it right.

      I didn't give Mira or Andreas any instructions on that scene
except what was in the script, which was minimal.  When you have two
performers that solid in the room, just give them the lines and run
like hell.

      Speaking of going back and rewatching episodes...part of this
goes right back to the *pilot*, where, you'll recall, G'Kar tried to
seduce Lyta, mentioning that there are no Narn telepaths, and they feel
very strongly it's important to their survival that they start breeding
them at the first opportunity.

      Ding....!

      No, because that would mean doing a story without our main
characters, since G'Quan's story took place about a thousand years ago,
and I don't think I could sell that.  (Unless I did another time travel

      What's really left to address?  The reasons given were the
reasons; the Minbari warrior caste were very much against the Babylon
project; an extremist clan within that caste decided to frame Sinclair
for murder, using what little info they had on the vorlons, in an
attempt to destabalize or defeat the goals of B5.

Subject: <Women on B5>

{original post unavailable}

      It's got nothing to do with second class citizenship.  I'm
sorry, but when lives are at stake, *any* justification is acceptable
for saving them. When a ship goes down at sea, as much as possible it
tends to be the rule that women and children go first.  It's not
putting women and children on the same social level, that's silly and a
misstatement of fact.  The notion is that often men are physically
better suited to taking care of themselves in a physically dangerous
situation *as civilians*.  Now, if you're talking military, you need
only to watch the same episode, "Severed," and you see women combat
soldiers slugging it out, and getting stabbed, and killed, right along
with the male soldiers.

      Some people seem to feel that if one shows compassion for any
group, that somehow you are saying that's a lower or second class. 
It's sad when compassion can become warped around to mean something
else.  It's also illogical.

      If the position is that women are second class citizens in this
case, then the cry would be, "Don't fire, we've got men down here." 
Because that would imply that the men are more important; you'd get
"men first" on sinking ships because, as first class citizens, men
would be more important, and thus more worth saving, yes?

      In a crisis situation, where people are going to die, you try to
get out those for whom you care, and to whom you give status.  Those
which are important, and may be less able, physically, to deal with
great stress or danger.

      So, basically, no, the statement did not come from any agenda;
your analysis, however, *did*.

                                                                  jms

      No, it's never difficult for me to go from horror to romance to
comedy to action; they're just different colors in the artist's

difficult doing it, just in knowing *when* to do it, and *how* to do

      Logically, he can't just go away indefinitely, and it's going to
take a long time before they can get Carolyn in shape.  A very long
time.  If he stays, he'd be noticed and hunted down by the Corps, which
ends his usefulness.  His staying served no purpose.

      Yeah, generally it would fall to Garibaldi; it's no longer a
rank thing as much as a "who can we trust?" question.  And Delenn
maintains control of the Rangers in their absence.

      Good points.  In general, you always know when I'm going to
start answering a question, because I begin to point at it in episodes;
I'm now beginning to point to the shadows and ask, "What do THEY want?"

      The answer is coming.

      Thanks.  The Kosh stuff, his scene with Sheridan, and his
passing, is very moving.  I showed it at Marcon this weekend in Ohio,
and many folks, including Patricia Talman -- who hadn't seen it yet --
were in tears at that. That, to me, is the moment when you know you've
done something, when you can make people *feel* something.  Not just a
plot exercise, but you hit down deep where it hurts, or can make
someone laugh.  It's all about touching emotion...or what's the point?

      Because I think, on some level, Kosh knew it was inevitable; a
price had to be paid.  In a way, Lincoln had the same feelings...why
was he to live when so many had died?  In a way, he knew he wouldn't
live much longer. Also, it would mean running...and the Vorlons don't
run.  If he fled, another would pay the price...and that also wouldn't
be right.

       There's no relation between the aliens working for the shadows
and the Streib.  The ones you saw in the flash were "doctors" of a sort
doing the work; there was no abduction required except of course the
covert kidnapping from the Psi Corps Re-education Center.  As for
Bester's look behind, he was just looking to the guards behind him, and
the ones in front of him.

something very old and dark and dangerous in his way.  He had to get

       They would do so, but since the fall from Earth, as Susan

we saw in the teaser.  And Morden is good at covering his footsteps.

      Bottom line, Steven...what you're doing is applying not only
just Earth norms and standards of behavior to aliens, you're applying
distinctly Western modes of behavior, conduct and mentality.  You're
expecting them to think and act like we do, in the way we consider
logical.  You can't even apply that criteria to other countries right
here on Earth, let alone outside.  Is it logical to one day just walk
away from all your possessions, just leave them where they are, and
start walking, not coming back?  Here we consider that abnormal
behavior, abandoment...in Australia, among the Aboriginal culture, that
principle is called "walkabout" and is quite common and accepted 
behavior.  The idea of ritually mutilating a young woman's genitals is
a hideous, terrible notion to any sane person in this country...but in
many African nations, it's practiced quite commonly, on an everyday
basis as part of their notion of coming into womanhood.

      Part of having *alien* aliens is that they don't think like us. 
One big adjustment Americans rarely make when they go overseas is that
they expect everyone and everyplace to be just like home in attitude. 
But there are huge differences...and those differences can start wars.

                                                                  jms

      ISN is one of the only interstellar networks bounced via the

There are lots of other channels back home, but to get this far out you
need the support of the government.

we lose our options on the actors.

     "However, neither is it appropriate to view all alien behavior as

      Never implied it was.  In general, on the B5 station, though, if
an alien acts toward one of its own kind in a cultural oddity (to us),
we tend not to interfere unless so requested; if, however, an alien
turns that cultural oddity toward one not of its own species, then the
B5 staff would definitely intervene.

      True, though the female version of this, as practiced in some
countries, is extremely debilitating and far more violent or severe. 
Much as we are all attached to our respective genitalia, I'd suggest
that snipping the foreskin is not quite so severe as taking a razor
blade and cutting OFF the clitoris and parts of the labia major, as is
done in some places.

      But you're right, the practice on either side is certain of a
piece (so to speak).

      I think probably most races that have to evolve through a
superstitious phase, at some point enter a religious phase (which is an
organized system of superstition by strictest definition) until such
time as the tools are there for the more scientific description of the
universe.  So within that context, yes, most cultures would have at
least one major figure in that area in its history.

Some of the cassettes provided have the opening sequences in a

No, color correction is done in post, to make sure that all the colors

      Yeah, they could've brought him a list...and he'd have seen the

doesn't happen much on this show, hardly ever.  I figured she'd be one

*do* happen.  How many times have you reached for the phone to call

      B5 is still a place of considerable commerce, access to lots and

and there are probably lots of Centauri back home who would prefer he
stay here.  As for the rest...better the devil you know than the devil

       One can certainly argue that Franklin's actions were hasty,
that he is basically running away from the *consequences* of the
problem he has, as much as from the problem itself.  This will, of
course, have to be dealt with.

       No, if the person is behind a door, or otherwise can't be
located visually, it's difficult to impossible to scan.

       It's a fair question.  I'm going to try and deal with it as
best I can. The problem, first and foremost, is trying to explain the
craft of writing to someone who isn't a writer.  This isn't intended as
a slight; if a brain surgeon tried to explain his work to me, I'd be
about as much in the dark.  I have no idea where music comes from; I
can sit with Chris Franke for hours, trying to understand that process.
I never will.  I'm not hardwired that way. I *am* hardwired for
writing.  So it's not a judgment, just a minor truth.

       The creative process is fluid.  Has to be.  Consider for a
moment the position in which I find myself.  Let's say I'm writing a
novel.  I start with a fairly clear notion of where I'm going.  Six
chapters in, I get a better way of doing something, so I go back and
revise chapters 1-5, so it now all fits; you never see what went
before.  Now, compare that to a situation where you're publishing each
chapter as you go, and you can't go back and change anything. (This is
pretty much the situation Dickens found himself in, as he published his
works chapter by chapter; you can never back up, only go forward.)

       At the same time, because we're using actors who have real
lives of their own, to whom things happen -- broken limbs, health
problems that may preclude appearing in a given episode, sudden career
changes, you name it -- you have real-life obstacles constantly in your
way.

       The closest thing I can compare this to...is if you're on
stage, in front of a large audience, and you have to do a very
elaborate dance...and all the while people are throwing bowling balls
and chainsaws at you.  You either learn how to accommodate all that,
and keep pretty much on rhythm, or you're dead.

       This show was originally conceived in 1986/87.  About 10 years
ago. Back then, all TV episodic stuff was done pretty much from one
person's point of view, your nominal hero.  Yes, you'd occasionally
dive outside that for a quick scene with other characters, usually to
set up something, but for the most part, it was about that one person. 
In MURDER, SHE WROTE, Jessica Fletcher was always at the heart of every
episode; you had the occasional guest character with whom she'd
interact, and the recurring supporting cast, but none of them ever
changed, and none of them ever really took center stage for more than a
few minutes at a time.  That's how TV has been done up until now.

       Novels, on the other hand, are often omniscient in narrative
structure, and you blip in and out of multiple points of view.  THE
STAND, for instance.

       Now, I've done both; I've written novels and I've written TV. 
When it came time to pull together B5 initially, you go into the "okay,
who is the TV point of view character" question.  Which was Londo's
narration, and which was the way I'd learned to write TV all these
years.  Once the series got going, it quickly became apparent that I'd
have to learn a whole new way of writing TV that was a lot more like
what I'd been writing in my novels, which were multi-POV huge stories. 
It's a kind of writing that's never really been done before for
American TV; and I had to somewhat invent that style or form of writing
as I went, in front of millions of viewers.

       You can't prepare for something like this, as much as you try,
because it's never been done before.

       (On reflection, probably the closest thing to what I've been
doing here was the miniseries The Winds of War, in terms of the
multiple viewpoints involved.)

       Also, in the last 10 years, I've become a better writer,
learned more about my craft, added more tools to my toolbox.  That
means being able to perceive better ways of doing things now than I
could've seen before.

       So here we are.  I sit at my word processor with my notes from
1986, and I see a better way of doing something from those notes...do I
go with what's there, or do I strike off and do the better approach,
PROVIDED that it still takes me where I want to go in the arc?  To
ignore it is to be inflexible.

       I've stayed fluid.  It's the same way I write a novel.  You're
just seeing the *process* acted out right in front of you, a process
which normally the public never gets to see.  That, I think, is some
part of what you're reacting to.

       Also, you have to be careful in how you define an arc.  There
have been definite arcs of character all through this.  Look at Londo
when we first met him...and look at him now.  Same for G'Kar, Delenn,
Franklin... look at Sheridan when he first arrived: happy go lucky,
smiling, glad to be there, fresh fruit and a hot shower, able to take
care of anything and everything, how bad can it be?...and look at the
dark, haunted, almost overwhelmed figure we see now.

       The story has also arc'd, peeling off layer by layer.  The
Minbari war leads to the secret of the Grey Council, which leads back
to the first shadow war, which leads to the current shadow war, each
really on a direct line one from the other.  The slow corruption of
Earthgov, the death of President Santiago, the rise of Clark, the fall
from Earth...all of it a very definite arc.

       It's not just a matter of "living in interesting times."  What
makes a story is *causality*.  A sequence of linked events.  "The king
died, and then the queen died" is not a story.  "The king died, and
then the queen died of grief" is a story.  It is an arc, however small.

       Finally, I'd just note the posts -- public and private -- from
folks who have sat down and watched the *whole show* as a unit, once
per day, or several per day...and the linked aspect, the real *arc* of
the show, becomes far more apparent when watched that way right now. 
It's there.

                                                                  jms

      Welcome to the party.  Videos aren't currently available, though
the second and third season episodes can get rerun over the coming

      And you can always disagree with a decision...and explain why. 
Around the stage, we have a simple policy...anybody can go up to me and

      Thanks.  The two aliens in the start of the episode were a
Brakiri and a Gaim.

      "Interludes" for me marks a slight transition in the story, from
one "shape" to the next up...the demarkation between the hero-cycle and
the myth-cycle in the arc.

      Basically because it's hard in an episode to just bring up
something out of the blue unless you're going to use it.  You're stuck
with, "Boy, I wish Adira were here...so what's for dinner?"  Which will
mean nothing to the folks who didn't see the first season unless you
then talk more about her, show her...and then suddenly you REALLY have
to deal with it or it's intrusive.

"The atheist is also denying the existence of God on faith since the
statement that there is no God anywhere in the universe is equally
impossible to prove (all universal statements are impossible to prove
and therefore inherently unscientific)."

That's a well phrased analysis of the situation...the only problem
with it is that it ain't so.

By your reasoning, if you say that there are green penguins at the
north pole, and I refuse to believe it until you prove it, then I am a
believer in non-green-penguinism.  I am, therefore, a believer in the
negative concept of everything in the universe that has not yet been
conclusively proven.  At which point the very notion of belief becomes
utterly meaningless.

If someone comes up to you and offers you a job if you move cross
country, wouldn't you want a contract, some proof that the offer is
real?  Until it's provided, are you believing in non-contractosity?

Bottom line, Daniel...if you or anyone else makes a statement, the
burden of proof is not on me to *disprove* it, it's on you to *prove*
it.  Until that point, the question of belief doesn't enter into it. 
Is it or is it not provable?  If not, then it isn't recognized as a
real thing.  Belief is irrelevant.  Once you've shown me my new car,
and I've driven in it, it doesn't require faith or belief to know it
exists.  For my money, no one has yet proven the existence of a supreme
or minor deity...so for me, it simply doesn't exist.  Again, belief has
nothing to do with it.

(I used the phrase belief system only because I didn't want to get
into a prolonged discussion of it, and that seemed the simplest way of
stating it. That'll teach me not to go for the precise terms, even if
it means another few paragraphs of explanation.)

      Daniel, you're on a slippery slide into sophistry.  Of *course*
one can make a blanket statement about some things.  Many things, in
fact.  I can declare, in no uncertain terms, that there are in fact no
Minbari.  They are a fictional creation.  So right off the bat that
negates your thesis.

      And, again, you miss the point...the statement is not "X does
not exist," that's the usual argument brought out to try and make
someone prove a negative, which is nearly impossible.  I repeat: the
burden of proof is NOT on the person saying "show me," the burden of
proof is on the person making the assertion.  You say there's a god. 
Show me objective, scientifically verifiable, quantifiable, repicable
evidence of same.  Otherwise, I can say that there is no evidence in
it, therefore I don't believe it.

                                                                  jms

      Yes, I'm often intrigued -- don't know if I'd say astonished --
at how the story is sometimes interpreted.  But that's the interactive
part of the process, what the viewer takes away is sometimes only
indirectly the result of what's actually *there*.  Take modern art for
a moment.  You show me a white canvas broken only by a single red dot
in the lower left hand corner, I see a single red dot in the lower left
hand corner of a white canvas, nod and walk away...somebody else takes
a look at it, and sees a telling commentary on isolationism and the
Communist scare of the 50s and man's basic inhumanity to man.

      Anything that passes for art reflects the work's creator, and
the viewer; it's a mirror that works in two directions, and neither
reflection holds the totality of the work individually.  Art happens in
the moments in-between.

"This is a discussion that *has* to take place on two different
levels.  One is the purely empirical where saying "there is a God" and
"There is no God" are both statements of nonsense devoid of real
meaning because they both claim to describe some aspect of reality yet
no test can be devised (again short of dying) that can falsify either
of them."

Once again, your knowledge of logic is faulty.  The attempt in logic,
debate or science is not to "falsify" or disprove anything; the goal is
to PROVE something.  Repeat after me: you cannot prove a negative.  The
burden of proof of any statement belongs with the person making the
assertion, NOT the person receiving it to disprove it.  You are simply
misstating how science and logic work in order to make a debating point
that doesn't hold up under scrutiny.

"Without a transcendent God imposing a transcendent morality upon man
there is no basis for rights save the state. Without a source of right
and wrong that exists outside of the human race there is no basis,
except for fickle human opinion, to say that Mother Teresa is better
than Adolf Hitler."

Another debating trick that also doesn't hold up to close inspection.

The notion of a monotheistic god -- *GOD* -- is fairly recent in human
terms. The Greeks managed to build an entire civilization that was
known for its arts, its philosophy, its advancement in all areas
(military included) using a host of household and minor deities who
were in NO way ANY kind of guide to what was right and wrong; half of
them were capricious and just plain nuts, the the other half were off
mating with human women and then writing off their kids.

Yes, in time Greece fell.  But so did Rome, the spearhead
(figuratively and literally) for Christian propagation worldwide in its
early history, so I wouldn't necessarily throw *that* into the mix.

Very, very, very few people decide not to murder because God wouldn't
like it. They don't murder (assuming they choose that) because they're
afraid of being apprehended and sentenced under the laws made by humans
in order to facilitate cooperation and progress and safety.  (If
anything, people have proped up the notion of god as rationale for
murder for centuries on all sides of the theological coin.)

I'm not saying that religion is per se bad, it's like any other human
artifact, including technology, it's what humans make of it.  But at
the same time it's self-indulgent in the extreme for folks who believe
to write off the whole of human history and say that if it weren't for
their particular deity, we wouldn't know right from wrong, or positive
from negative, that we'd just be staggering around blindly...when the
notion of that sort of god is extremely recent in human consciousness,
and prior to then we did okay; not perfect, we had wars and bloodshed
and the like...and we still do.  Most of it by believers in one thing
or another.

When was the last time you heard of an atheist car bombing an embassy
because he thought it would bring him closer to the void?  When was the
last time you heard of an atheist murdering his entire family because
he *didn't* hear the voice of god talking in his head?  When was the
last time you heard of an atheist declaring a crusade or a jihad or a
pogrom?  (And don't even try to bring the old soviet union into this;
that was a political madness that had less to do with belief systems
and more to do with the accumulation of personal power at the expense
of EVERYthing, that wouldn't allow for ANY divergence from what they
considered the norm.)

You can write off "fickle human opinion" all you want, but from where
I sit we haven't done too badly, all things considered.

If my tone seems to imply I took some small offense...the operative
word is "small," because I'm used to this.  On the one hand, I pretty
much don't have a problem with anything anybody believes so long as
nobody's hurt by it.  On the other, religionists tend to mutter darkly
that if it weren't for some god-inspired notion of right and wrong, if
we don't have that, well, we're just anchorless, as prone to murder a
child as give somebody a gift.  That it's all caprice.

Well, I happen to be an atheist, and I *can* tell the difference
between Mother Theresa and Hitler.  And your inference that one can't
is simply wrong and condescending.  As an atheist, I view every life as
*incredibly* valuable because we only get one turn around the merry go
round, and then it's over; no backsies, no second chances, no heavenly
choir to sing one into the pearly gates no matter how terrible or
abusive a life one's led as long as at the end one chooses to Believe. 
Every life is rarer than the rarest diamond, and since the only future
we have is that which we make, the only signs we were here are that
which we create, life must be preserved, nourished and given the chance
to grow.

Because those Greeks -- you remember, the ones who didn't believe in
your particular god, with its rules for right and wrong -- actually had
the audacity to once define happiness.  Not in terms of right and
wrong, but in even larger terms.  I noted them at Macon.  To wit: "The
exercise of vital powers along lines of excellence in a life affording
them scope."  It's about the only creed I live by.

Not bad.  Bet they could even figure out this whole Mother
Theresa/Hitler thing, too....

"One of the bedrock elements of science is that for a theory to be
taken seriously it must be falsifiable."

Nope.  If that's what you're thinking, then I suggest you go back and
check, because that's not correct in any respect.  To take the green
penguins at the north pole scenario again, I can search for 165 years,
and not find any, and you can say, "Well, I guess you just missed them,
but they're there."

It is not the purpose of scientific endeavor to *disprove* every
assertion, only to prove them.

Your statement is simply false.  I'm sorry.  Saying it's so doesn't
make it so.  So everything that proceeds from that is equally flawed. 
Any scientist or logician here will back me up on this.  You may not
want to hear it, Daniel, but you're simply wrong on this.

      Daniel, I hate to burst your balloon, but *everything* comes
down to a human standard, to human opinion.  Christianity as it's
practiced today is nothing like what was originally there around 100
AD.

      For a long time, the church had no problem with the concept of
slavery. Even used sections of the bible as proof that it was a proper
activity.  Only later, after society began to change, did they come
around. Why?  Because they reacted to changing human opinions.  Once,
the proper way to deal with heretics was to burn them at the stake, or
press them with stones.  That changed as society changed.

      And I'm sorry, but I've *read* the bible, twice, cover to cover,
and I don't see any perfect guide or example of right and wrong there. 
I see a fictional deity that is capricious, slightly insane, petty,
inconsistent, vindictive...jealous, by its own admission, a trait we
would deplore in ourselves.

      The whole Adam/Eve thing was a mean-spirited setup.  The tree
was the tree of knowledge, remember; the penalty was death.  But
insofar as we know, nothing died in the garden, certainly no other
people had died.  So to say "you shall surely die" was a meaningless
concept.  They were children, they didn't know what the penalty meant. 
And the kicker is...if the tree truly *were* the knowledge of good and
evil, and they didn't have that knowledge until after they ate the
fruit...then THEY DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS WRONG WHEN THEY DID IT.  They'd
only know it was wrong AFTERWARD.

      And for this they and their inheritors across ten thousnd
generations were sentenced to pain and death?

      This is the example of transcendental rightness you would hold
before me?

      Thank you, but I'll apply elsewhere.

                                                                  jms

      Here's a little interesting aside...I used to write for Madeline
Murry O'Hare's magazine, AMERIAN ATHEIST, back when I was in college. 
I did a humor column, the occasional article, that sort of thing.

      But over time, I came to the conclusion that she wasn't just
trying to push for rights for atheists, but in fact was working to
*eliminate* religion, which I had a moral and ethical problem with. 
The constitution is there to allow anyone to believe, or not believe,
whatever they choose.  If the day comes when certain relgions are
banned, I'll be right there on the front lines with everybody else
fighting for the restoration of those rights (though I have a quiet
suspicion that the same might not happen if the situation were 
reversed).  I felt that this was supremely wrong, and resigned as a
result.

      No, actually, there's a much simpler answer to the Ironheart

      If we all remember the episode, he was trying as hard as he
could to control himself, lest his abilities tear the place apart.  He
was deliberately and with great pain trying NOT to use his abilities in
any way, manner, shape or form.  He was also in great physical pain,
was later shot, and became transcendent...which tends to kind of

      I think the nature of the debate is using the wrong language
here; I think when people are saying I'm "open-minded" it's possible --
and I'm only suggesting this, not to put words in anybody's mouth --
that the word being searched for is actually "fair."  Am I open minded
about the possibility of deities?  No, in that you're correct.  Am I
fair and/or open-minded in the treatment of religions on the show, in
saying that for many people, it's a good thing *for them*?  I like to
think so.  And that may be what's under discussion.

"Otherwise what stops me from decreeing that I have a "right" to
everything you own and backing up that claim with the fact that I am
better armed than you?  Rights must be granted by some force greater
than the individual. That leaves God or the state."

And, of course, this is exactly what happened on a regular basis
throughout human history until only the last couple of centuries.

If it was god doing this granting of rights...where was he for the
last six thousand years?  Snoozing off in a corner somewhere?

No, the rights you speak of were won by humans, fighting for their
right not to be trammeled upon by greater forces, and bonding together
in common cause to make sure it doesn't happen again in this place.

While many of the "founding fathers" were believers, many others were
simply deists, or freethinkers...they didn't do what they did because
suddenly they figured god had given them the right, but because they
got pushed to the wall, and we were 3000 nautical miles away from King
George, and they in their very human way got fed up with being pushed
around and decided it was time to push back, and create a set of laws
that would prevent the tyrant from trying it again, or rising from
within.

Sorry, Daniel, we did this on our own.  God's a credit jumper.

"The "arc" is fully alive for you now, I think.  Without these
characters living and breathing inside your mind I don't see how one
man could write as much as you have over the past two seasons.  What I
*have* noticed is that all the actors now seem to be responding to the
story you're telling."

Yeah, it's kind of a funny thing...the deeper we got into the season,
as the actors saw only one name on script after script, and they began
to understand what was coming, and it's all *very* consistent...the
sense of this being a novel really came through for everyone in a very
profound way.  You could really feel a change in everyone's attitude,
though it'd be hard to put into words.  A sense of, "This is it, this
is the story, we're moving now, we're doing something nobody's ever
done."  They know how hard it is for anyone to write this many scripts,
which is why it's never been done before, and I think they not only
respected that, but felt they had to rise to the challenge and give
just as much at that end of it.  Usually you tend to hit a slump 
energy-wise in your third year; not here.  Everyone's just hitting all 
cylinders.

      Actually, no, the replacement isn't Kosh, as you say, it's
another Vorlon, with a very different personality...the "we are all
Kosh" is more of a conceptual thing....

      Exactly.  The constitution (this is from memory, so I may get a
word out of place) stipulates "Congress shall make no law respecting
the establishment of religion, or prohibit the free exercise thereof." 
Which means the state should have nothing to say about it one way or
the other. It's a personal matter for each individual.  It's a bit of
wisdom that goes back about 2,000 years; "Render unto Caesar that which
is Caesar's; and to god that which is god's."

      That the line gets blurred sometimes is really in violation of
what the bible seemed to suggest.  The pharisees were synonymous with
hypocrites, they had allied themselves with the government of the time,
and that was their downfall in the final analysis; the state invariably
corrupts religion.  The overall sense was to keep away from the
government, to strive for something higher.  These days a fair amount
of religion has become mass theater, much in violation of the
suggestion to "go into your closet to pray," and the suggestions that
those who made a show of their beliefs were not exactly role models.

      The state should be religion-neutral, neither encouraging nor
discouraging.  Sometimes this is unfair to one group or another, but
as long as it does so consistently, not favoring either side, then it's
okay.  The best compromise is one in which neither side feels it's
entirely won.  (Yes, some of the questions of where and when religious
artifacts can be put up stray into grey areas...but at least the
patriotism of those involved is not usually up for grabs.  During one
Presidential election, then Vice-President Bush, on a campaign stop in
Chicago, was asked about his reaction to atheists, and he said, "Well,
that's certainly their choice, though I don't see how anybody could
call them patriots, since this is one nation under god." Substitute
catholics or jews or moslems or japanese or irish for atheists in that
sentence, and you'd have a firestorm that would've brought down the
whole campaign.  Here nobody even seemed to notice.)

                                                                  jms

      Exactly.  That's a *very* good point; I'd forgotten about Romans
2:14. There are sections that imply that those who don't hear The
Gospels will be judged by their own actions and their own conscience,
which implies the presence of a conscience (as does the quote you cite)
even in the absence of a "transcendental" being, that is, knowing right
from wrong.  Excellent point.

      "...the largest problem we have in this country is that we have
moved from a justice system to a legal system."

      Wow...I've never heard that put so simply and so succinctly. 
And it's absolutely correct.  Nicely done.

                                                                  jms

      Yes, Daniel, but you keep dancing away from the fact that the
catholic church, and the Jewish religion, have also had changes and
schisms and fractures, as the result of *changes in human opinion*.  If
there were an eternal truth being practiced, then it should be
unchanging.  But religion is *constantly* changing because of
alterations in social mores and opinions. The role of women in the
synagogue.  The changes from latin to english mass. The final decision
by the church that maybe the sun *doesn't* rotate around the earth. 
The ordination of women rabbis.  The dietary restrictions as set forth 
in the Bible.

      Heck, Daniel, the Old Testament goes on and on at great length
to explain how the laws work, that the laws are the only ways to get
over to the pleasant side of the afterlife...then suddenly in the new
testament it's all, "No, no, forget the laws, THIS is how you do it." 
What, god was just kidding for the preceding couple thousand years?

      Go back to the early Catholic records, read the Dead Sea
Scrolls, the early Roman records, and you'll find that the practice of
Christianity today is utterly unlike its early history.  Religion
changes as the world around it changes...or it dies.

      The constant, unchanging religion you cite doesn't exist in
reality. It's ALL a case of "it seems to me."  Every time a new pope
comes in, you get a massive case of it.

                                                                  jms

      Yes, there is something thematically present about growing up,
and parents, and coming of age that threads through the story.

      And yes, there's the deliberate irony...that just as we finally
start to really hear from Kosh...he's gone.  Snatched away just as we
got close. Which would add to the feelings.

      Good analysis.

"Alright, you and I are both humans.  We are in essence equal.  So by
what authority do you say that "A" is bad and "B" is good and why
should I respect it?"

You respect if if there are more people than you are who believe A is
bad and B is good, and they pass a bunch of laws requiring your
adherence to this.

Furthermore...

You, as a christian, say A is bad, B is good, suggesting the
transcendental guidance of your particular deity or prophet.

A moslem says B is good, and A is bad, based on the transcendental
guidance of HIS particular deity or prophet.

So how is this resolved?

See, this is one of the problems people bring to the table on this
argument; they argue that truth always comes from transcendental
god...omitting that they mean THEIR PARTICULAR god, that this alone is
real truth...and the other guys are just misled.  "Ours is BETTER.  Our
god can beat up their god."

It's like those who want creationism taught in schools...oddly, when
they bring this up, it's always the christian version of this...you
don't tend to hear much about the one where Earth is carried on the
back of a giant turtle....

To your questions:

1.  Kosh died fighting, I guess, and I'm also guessing that he took
some Shadows with him.  How was this fight different than the one we
didn't see in "Signs and Portents"?  Were there more Shadows this time
or are they getting stronger?

They were not initially prepared to kill him.  That was a territorial
or jurisdictional squabble.  This was retribution.

2.  If Kosh did take out some Shadows, will more be sent to Morden as
replacements?

He didn't.  Hurt 'em good, but didn't take them out.

3.  Did Kosh project to Delenn, G'Kar, or anyone else besides Sheridan
during the fight?

No.

4.  Did Garibaldi ever get a chance to speak with Kosh about the
Talia/Abbut data crystal as hinted at in "Divided Loyalties"?

Yes.

5.  Besides being extremely old, was Kosh an average Vorlon or
particularly special in terms of strength, skill, or status?  No other
ambassador on the station has demonstrated the clout back home to
sortie an entire fleet at a moments notice.  Delenn and Londo have only
called on forces from a particular faction in their polities.

He was certainly well regarded...one of the older of the vorlons.

       No, Santiago wasn't involved with the shadows; certain elements
within his government, however, *were*.  Which was one reason why they
needed to get him out of the way.

"Here's a different kind of question for you: When you sit down to
work, I know you're not entirely in charge - the characters are - but
how do you participate? When I write fiction (admittedly not often), it
either flows out onto the page as though someone else were using my
hands on the keyboard, or nothing happens at all, no matter how long I
sit there. You don't seem to have any "nothing" time. Did you *develop*
a sustainable creative process, or were you just always this way?  In
short, can you train - or at least successfully invite - the Muse, and
how do you do it?"

Hard to say...it's like any muscle, the more you use it, the easier it
gets to use.  I think a part of it stems from the fact that I have very
little in the way of barriers between me and the writing.  Too many
people who want to be writers feel that when they sit behind the
keyboard, they have to do something different or other...that somehow
WRITING has an overlay of some sort, that it's different than talking. 
But in many ways, it ain't any different.

The best writing (IMO) is natural writing, where the words on the page
flow very naturally, very smoothly.  Every once in a while, you pull
out all the stylistic tricks, you thunder and lightning all over the
page, when needed for effect...but it's the writing free of artifice
that seems, for me, to work well.  If you hang out with writers long
enough, the really *good* ones, you learn soon enough that most of them
talk exactly the way they write.

Lemme give you a forinstance...when Asimov was first struggling as a
writer, he had lunch with his agent one day.  He was having a hard time
describing things, using language to paint pictures.  The agent said,
"You know how Hemingway would describe the sun rising in the morning?" 
No, Asimov said, leaning in...how?  "The sun rose in the morning."

There's virtually nothing between my brain and the keyboard; I'm
hardwired that way, which is why I can't dictate scripts...I write
through my fingers. I write pretty much the way I talk.  A lot of folks
hereabouts have seen me at conventions, and they've noted that the me
you see here is pretty much the me they see there, and the me that's
just *there* all the time.

If you stop thinking about *trying to write*, and just write...the way
you have to stop thinking about the next step you make, and just
*dance*...the way you have to forget about technique and just make
love...it all comes together. You don't Try To Write.  You just write.

As for story ideas...it's just nothing I've ever had a problem with. 
As long as your characters are all distinct personalities, the stories
you write will be as distinct and different as they are.  Find out who
the character is, what he wants, how far he'll go to achieve it, and
how far somebody else will go to stop him...and the rest takes care of
itself.

      Thanks.  I will confess I go back and forth about getting into
this kind of conversation on the nets; either way, it will have an
effect on how people perceive the show.  And, basically, I'm here to
talk about the show, and be responsive to questions, not necessarily to
put my beliefs, attitudes or prejudices out there in other people's
faces.  I'm not what matters here, I'm not terribly interesting...it's
the show, and those two can't ever be allowed to get confused.  I was
kicking myself for days for allowing myself to get dragged into this
(and it's nobody's fault but my own that it happened).  It's not really
my place to go around lecturing anyone or spouting off to anyone about
what they believe, and a few times, when the debate got really warmed 
up, I did that.

      What I do or don't believe is fundamentally irrelevant to the
discussion, as long as I can keep it out of the show.  (The one area
where it does get through that you note -- the importance of life and
the right to choose one's own road through that -- is there, granted,
but there aren't a whole lot of reasonable counter-arguments to that
one.)

      Because I make this show, I have -- for lack of a better phrase
 -- a platform from which to spout off.  People tend to at least note
what I say, even though most of it is rather silly, though I don't for
a second buy into the notion that people are overmuch influenced by
anything I say here. Particularly those on-line, who tend to be a
fairly hardy bunch, intellectually speaking.  But there's still an
obligation not to misuse or abuse that platform, or take advantage of
it to spout notions that don't really touch the show per se at any two
contiguous points.

      In short...sometimes I say more than I should, and should learn
to just Shut Up once in a while.  If this time out the discussion has
done some good, then that's great.  But I still think some days I
shouldn't have allowed it to happen.  If somebody wants to take a pot
shot at my beliefs, let 'em. It's only pixels.

                                                                  jms

       That's the hard part, the doing.  Lots of folks have ideas, but
they flit, or they don't have the discipline to sit down behind a
keyboard and just *do it* for the requisite number of hours per day. 
And that's the one thing neither I nor anyone else can help or advise
with.  It's what Marcus said: patience, determination, direction and
strength.

       And to quote somebody else, sometimes some people mistake a
passion for reading for a desire to write.  They're wholly different
impulses.

       Writers write.  It's what they do.  If you're struggling to do
it, maybe it's part of your brain throwing roadblocks in front of you
to try and tell you something.  Maybe it's a lack of discipline, or
attention span, or something deeper, a concern about finishing, or some
other area.

       I dunno...this is one area where I can't advise worth a damn,
because I've never had this problem.  It's Heinlein's (and Ellison's)
rules of writing: you must write, you must finish what you write, you
must put it on the marketplace, and you must keep it on the marketplace
until sold. Sometimes we get caught by the *idea* of a story, but to
actually finish writing it, the *execution* of that idea, takes a great
deal of work, and if the basic idea is already down there, the impetus
to write it, the steam feeding the machine, evaporates quickly.  Only a
conscious decision to finish the damned thing can carry you the rest of
the way, a commitment to follow through on the craft of the
STORYTELLING.

       It's the difference between two kinds of people who talk about
how they met their respective spouses.  One says "at a party," the
other says, "at Bob's part in Toluca Lake, and she was wearing a red
dress, and I couldn't take my eyes off her until I got her alone for a
minute."  Idea vs. execution, telling the idea vs. telling the *story*.

                                                                  jms

{original post had no questions}

       Oddly enough...I think there's room for arc series elsewhere. 
What I think is killing Murder One is that we just lived *through* this
with the OJ Simpson trial, and everybody kind of got uniformly fed up
with it, and so just don't have it in them to go through it again in a
fictional environment.

                                                                  jms

      No, it's not that...but in person, I generally tend to be fairly
quiet and reserved, almost verging on shy.  In groups I tend to vanish
into the wallpaper.  You'll usually find me at the back of the room,
observing.  I'm not terribly extraordinary looking, rather average
really, in contrast with what some perceive of me online, as evidenced
by an email note I got just today where someone fancied me a mix of Sam
Kinneson and Sean Connery, based on the messages here and elsewhere.

      I can gear it up when I have to go to a convention and perform,
but the rest of the time...I'm nearly invisible.  And I mean
*invisible*.  As some small proof of this, when I went to my 20th high
school reunion, I knew every face and every name I saw.  Out of the
hundreds of people who showed up, two
 -- TWO -- vaguely sorta kind remembered me, but that's about it.  I
passed through their ranks without leaving even a footprint.  This is
the norm, not the exception.  Online, I can be Cary Grant...but
offline, closer to Don Knotts.

      Thanks.  I've actually heard similar from others who've gone
back and done the same thing...including some who, as you did, were
kinda "Oh, yeah?" for the first part.  But as long as someone's willing
to go back and look at what's there with an open mind, I don't have any
complaints, and no apologies are ever required.

      SF fans have so often been disappointed by shows that it's
natural after a while to have "a chip on one's shoulder," as you
say...I think it's based on a desire to defend oneself, to not get
sucked in One More Time. It's understandable.

      To your questions: no plans for Ironheart at this time,
omnipotent beings running around my universe make me nervous...Sinclair
and Delenn aren't married, it was stated as a *rebirth ceremony* which
CAN sometimes double as a marriage ceremony, the rebirth being Delenn's
upcoming change... she became more "passive," more insecure, after her
change; that began to turn around after her encounter with Mr.
Sebastian...and we saw the Sigma 957 ship again in "Voices of
Authority."

      Beyond that...thanks for the great words.  They help.  Pulling
this show off is a tough job, harder than I think anyone knows, or ever
will know, or ever *should* know, since that's irrelevant to what's on
the screen.

       I don't consider them a "rival," there's room enough for

my personal view, I rather like the new Doctor.  He's probably the best
they've had since Tom Baker, who for me has always been the
quintessential Doctor.  There were some story lapses, and the female
doctor is a good performer but needs to be written less
annoyingly...but all the ingredients are there.  I hope they get 
approved to series; I'll be watching.

       The time-flash (which in Sheridan's case is much more
pronounced than what we've seen before) slides you forward or backward
in time to where you are at that moment.  At that moment, 18 years from
now (in the story), Sheridan was/will be on Centauri Prime.  So when he
slid along the time line, that's where he ended up.  Just as in Babylon
Squared, when Garibaldi had a timeflash back to his time on Mars.  It
blips your perception to another point in your life, wherever you
happen to be.

      If "free speech (and) the right to keep and bear arms are God
given rights," then why didn't God give them?  Why did it take a number
of humans to *decide* that it was time to strive for something better? 
The rights you speak of were never given by god, they were given by
those who spent their life's blood in an effort to create something
better for their inheritors. If god had anything to say on this issue,
he should've said it in the 6,000 years preceding, and *done* something
about it.  He didn't.  We did.

      I thought about that long and hard when writing the script, and
I finally came to the conclusion that there was literally *nothing* we
could show that wouldn't be disappointing...it's a conflict on another
whole plane, and should have an almost cosmic or ethereal feel to it. 
If we showed Kosh shooting a defensive field, or a shadow opening his
suit with a can opener, or anything else obvious and physical, it
would've diminished the scene.  The vorlons are mythic, indirect, you
see them out of the corner of your eye, so it fit that the proper
metaphor would be to handle the battle that way.

      Even if we'd had ten million bucks to do that sequence...I
would've made the same choice.

      There probably wasn't a credit there because it was an
incidental voice rather than a recurring voice.

      The other Vorlon also sounded different because I directed
Ardwight in different inflections...literally stood there outside the
booth using my hand like a baton to indicate the rising and falling
inflections as he spoke, to give it a wave kind of sound.

      I don't recall the make, but it plugs in at the game card, the
mouse port, AND the keyboard port.  Frankly, it scares the hell out of
me.

      The real drag about Twin Peaks is that, apparently, as told to
me by some of the writers who worked on the show, they really had NO
idea where they were going.  They just kept throwing stuff out there. 
I was vastly disappointed.

      In a way, each subsequent season tends to become stronger
because now you know who these people are.  If you come to care about
them, then the events that affect them have more power.  I've heard
from folks who've watched the first season or two over again, and now
that they know who these people are, found them much stronger than the
first time through.  It's the nature of the beast.

      A toast for a wedding, eh?  I'm not usually asked to do this
sort of thing -- I generally avoid those morbid parentheticals of the
human soul, weddings and funerals -- but off the top of my head....

      The heart is an inland sea, surrounded on either side by
infinities of time.  On one side, the unsteady molecule, shaken by
storm and the unlikely perambulations of amino acids, paraded across
the centuries until their name was man, and woman, until they created
poetries and cities and walked across the Sea of Tranquility.  On the
other side, an uncertain future, waiting to be shaped by hands clasped
across that ocean of possibilities.  Looked at from here, in the
starlight of sanctified vows, that horizon can be daunting, even 
frightening.  But there is nothing so dark or so profound that it can
outwit the infinity that is behind you, or undo all that went into
creating you.  Any problems before you are temporary; but the inland
sea of the heart is eternal. May your journey be filled with calm seas
and clear skies, guided by the compass of your entwined souls.

      Your observation is correct; the structure of B5 to a great
extent is that of the novel, which is, after all, what's being
attempted.  So you go from introduction, to rising action, to conflict,
complication, climax and denouement.  A novel for TV.

                                                                  jms

      Actually, Delenn probably has more outfits than just about

green active-wear look, her grey cloak and white religious caste robes,
one more change of color...so I think your observation here is flawed.

      That's because tachyons are unique particles; they appear to be
moving the wrong way through time.  So they're natural for this

      Who said there was a mystery about Sheridan going to Z'ha'dum? 
Kosh seems to treat it as a fait accompli; so does Sheridan.  It seems
fated that he will go...the question is when, why, and under what
circumstances, with what results?

      See, sometimes the story works in the shadows (so to
speak)...and other times we're right out in the open, we hand you the
playbook and tell you we're coming right up the middle.  And *that's*

      There was certainly some division among Minbari; Valen
straightened a lot of that out.

      I appreciate the questions, but there are so many alternate

      No, B4 was never intended to go forward in time.  The aging was
done pretty much as intended.  And the Soul Hunter meant they're using
him to create their old Leader.  Still tracks.  I'll have more to say
about all this after everyone's seen the episode.

      Nope.  The machine came up with Zathras from Epsilon 3.  It
first appeared with Sinclair, then later got into Delenn's hands.  So
she still has that version of it.

      Thanks.  To the questions...no, we only saw the black flak
uniforms in B2, because I knew we'd be changing them, but wanted to
hide that fact (as I did with Delenn's line to Sinclair in B2, done
off-camera to hide her change). And the Minbar cityscape was done by
Eric Chauvin.

      No, they didn't know at the time; most of them were still trying
to figure the whole damned thing out; some refused to accept it, and if
he was indeed bogus, wanted him killed to avoid becoming a false
prophet and undoing Minbari society; some *did* believe it was him. 
This disagreement in a sense became the first loose thread in
unraveling parts of Minbari society.

      Well, Zathras appeared in Babylon Squared, so you might have

yes, you seem to be close to it all...which is good.  All the pieces

      It was made for Kosh, as Delenn points out, was almost a part of
him; it wouldn't function as well, if at all, for anyone else.  There
was nothing else to be done.

      The eye was of the keeper on Londo's shoulder, you can see
G'Kar's fingers gripping a part of it.  It woke up.

      The other questions will have to wait, and be answered in the

      Actually...incorrect.  Whenever there's a timeflash, people see
one thing or another.  When Sinclair and Garibaldi first came aboard,
there was a timeflash.  We saw what Sinclair saw, we have no idea from
that scene what Garibaldi saw.  No reason he couldn't have seen
something from about that same period.  It wasn't stated either way at
the time.

                                                                  jms

      The design *has* changed; the main section is much longer, and
more primitive looking, less tricked out.  You can see a bit of it
there, but you will see them in more detail in part two.

      Sinclair was scarred during ranger training duties.

      Yes.  Up until that moment, the total forces available to the
shadows were an unknown to us...sort of like Shroedinger's Cat, is it
alive in the box or is it dead?  It could be either one.  If they
didn't go into the past, didn't affect the outcome, it would be one
reality; if they did, then it'd be another.  As soon as they achieved
one or the other of those two, the two possible results collapsed into
the one, singular possibility.

       Yes, you're correct about the Delenn material; she left the

to check on Delenn that Marcus was coming out as well.

      No, Sheridan "leapt" into his future self, hence the difference
in wardrobe and appearance.  Londo wasn't suprised to see him.  If you
recall the Centauri guard when we first arrive in the Palace, he says,
"I think he's awake again, would you like to see?"  The implication
being that he's been beaten into unconsciousness, hence Londo's line,
"Welcome back from the abyss."  It was at that moment of
unconsciousness that he "slid" into his future self.

      Yes, I've heard the "looking at a house" notion...and I've also
noted the Rohrscharch test, in which you look at random drawings, and
the human mind, which seeks out patterns, takes that which has no
meaning and puts a meaning onto it.

      No, I don't believe anyone on Minbar was wearing shorts.  It's
not the season for that.

      As for Valen, he died about 900 years ago, our time.  He lived

       It's a literary...I hate to say the word trick, but it's the
most descriptive.  You show somebody the end right off the bat, as we
did with the Londo/G'Kar scene.  But how do we get there?  What
happens?  Yes, the war is eventually won...but what *was* the price? 
And what does it mean to everyone involved?

       The best magic is when it's right there in your face, and you
can't see how it's being done.

       To your question, yes, the scenes with Zathras pinned under the
strut were the same scenes from B2, we didn't reshoot that material.

       The hardest shot was matching the lighting and composition in
the central corridor *exactly* for the Ivanova-on-the-link scene, and
the walk by seconds later by Garibaldi and Sinclair.  That came out
pretty seamless.

       The leather strip was also present when we shot the original,
Babylon Squared, in year one.  I was kinda thinking at the time that
the change was gradually being introduced in various divisions of
Earthforce.  Krantz is from the Marines division, I believe (note the
brown uniform), from that part which functions sort of like the Army
Corps of Engineers, overseeing the building of space stations and the
like.  Since it takes time to introduce a uniform change across
divisions and light years, I figured some might have them earlier than
others, or to try them out.  So I gave Krantz the leather strip.

       The scar came during ranger training.

       Marcus's look came because he overheard the Minbari-language
part of the discussion, and knew something was up.  It made him more
watchful of Sinclair, which pays off in WWE2.

      Re: the Chrysalis device...it came from Epsilon 3.  There was
one shot that should've been made more of, where we see a long box with
a silver triangle on one side being set up, and left.  Unfortunately,
the shot didn't make much of it (you can see Zathras putting it out
there), and a later shot we dropped showing it again because it wasn't
properly featured and you couldn't really tell what it was.  There was
so much in this episode that had to be pulled off, in a short amount of
time, that sometimes things in the background don't get framed as they
might be.  But that's where it came from: from Epsilon 3 to Sinclair to
Delenn, who still has it.

      Not at all.  Yes, a character dies...after a season of getting
to know him.  To say, "Well, you just put in a character to kill him,"
and citing red shirts, is really...well, a red herring and a
distortion.  A redshirt, by definition, was usually a security guard
who was introduced in the same episode in which he was killed, we knew
*nothing* about him, he had maybe 2 minutes of screen time, maybe a
word ("look out!", and then he was dead.

      By the definition you apply, anyone who dies in a novel is a
redshirt, since the author knew he was going to be killed off.  If you
do a novel about the Civil War, and Lincoln dies halfway through, is
that a redshirt?  Many of the characters in The Stand don't make it to
the end...are they redshirts?

      I hate to break it to you, but *everybody* dies sooner or later.
For the purposes of this show, some die on camera, some die off, some
die during the story, some die afterward.

      Nor was Keffer's character useless; through him, we got to see
the Starfury pilots and learn more about them, we got our first close
look at the shadows, we met the Gropos, and the primary incident that
began to unravel the whole thing -- Keffer's gun camera footage -- came
about.

      And Corwin's character is still very much alive, and useful in
the story, so that kinda disqualifies *that*.

      Thanks; no plans for Talia for the time being.

      I agree with much of what you said.  The unexamined life is a
real peril, and literature at its best can help us to avoid that trap
by asking uncomfortable questions.

      I actually tend to think that the day-to-day questions can be
more central, more profound, than where to buy a house.  Do you tell
your friend that his/her spouse is having an affair?  Do you intervene
when you see someone on the street being mugged?  Do you have an
abortion?  Do you sacrifice buying the boat you always wanted so you
can put your kid through college?

      At some point in our lives, we have to make a baseline decision
about whether our actions will be ethical, or convenient; do we do
right, or do we do wrong?  Some may seem like small or unimportant
decisions, but each one made for the wrong reasons makes it easier for
the next bad decision to slip through.

      Politicians tell us that we can find lives in which courage and
hard decisions are not necessary.

      They are, of course, lying.

                                                                  jms

      Sheridan's stabalizer basically broke into two major pieces, the

      I don't believe the UK has acquired the widescreen versions, no,
otherwise they'd be playing them currently, as is the case in France
and Portugal.  What happens after the current run, I don't know.

      He lived close to a hundred years as a Minbari; they're a long

      The Talia situation likely could've been finessed more smoothly
than it was, no mistake.  Sometimes there are going to be ragged spots.
It's going to happen.

      Here's the best comparison to what my position is with this
show: Harlan Ellison has, on occasion, done this routine where he'll go
into a bookstore and write a story in full view of everyone.  As each
page is finished, it's taped to the wall unti it's done.  This is
considered a pretty nifty trick, sustained over maybe 15-20 pages.

      That's pretty much what I'm doing here.  It's an ongoing story. 
I can't go back, I can only go forward.  As each page (episode) is
finished, it's put up on the wall, and I have to go on to the next one.
So far I've written 2,400 pages on that wall.  Again, I can't go back
and change anything, and if there's a bump caused by a real world
incident, it simply has to be accommodated as best I can while still
going where I have to go.

      From time to time, there's going to be a misstroke on the
keyboard, or there's going to be a typo that I'll miss.  That's
inevitable when you're out performing in front of a massive crowd on
the high wire without a net.  As long as the totality of it all hangs
together, as long as the story is told, the trick finally done...then
that's what fundamentally matters.

      That this happens on occasion should be obvious; that it happens
as rarely as it does is the point of wonderment, I think.  Remember,
it's all trial and error, because no one's ever done this before.  And
right about now I understand why.  But we're making it work.

                                                                  jms

      Sakai certainly wouldn't have wanted to get tied down to life on
Minbar, and Sinclair knew that his life would be difficult now with the
rangers, so they parted ways.

      But see, not every story has to be about the Important People. 
We've got that in our nominal "heroes."  What tends to get omitted from
SF are the grunts and the blue collar guys, the pilots who have to fly
the missions called on by the Big Guys.  To say "are they important"
is, I think, really a question that proceeds from a skewed perspective.
Are *you* important to the overall arc of this nation, the history of
this country?  Am I?  Probably not; I'll never sign a constitution or
discover radium or walk on the moon, I just write stories for phosphor
dot screens; can there be anything more ephemeral? But the
repercussions of history are written on the faces and the lives of 
those who *can't* change it, who have to live with the decisions made
by those above.  Showing those people is as valid as anything else.

      It ain't just the heroes that make the future, Edwin.  It's the
carpenters and the plumbers and the dockworkers we showed in the first
season. Now, you may think they're unimportant.  I don't.

                                                                  jms

      No, because you'll note that Sheridan isn't scarred by it.  No,
you have to remember that one doesn't just transplant one storyline
onto another.  It doesn't work that way.  Sinclair has his arc,
Sheridan has his own.

      I'm sure Garibaldi will eventually end up on the White Star; and

      Well, if the Minbari had records of B4's visual look, given that

      In a way, this question touches on the issue that got raised in
another thread here, about who's the "important" character.  We all
have the potential for importance, if we choose to exercise it, and
recognize the necessity of personal commitment.

      The element I couldn't quite fit into War....

      In B2, Krantz says they found Zathras when there was a flash,
and he appeared in a conference room.

      Now, I sketched out that scene when it came time to actually
write the whole WWE two-parter.  What happened, basically, was that
Zathras was passing by a room where he saw the one piece he still
needed to finish his repairs on the time stabalizer.  He slips in, as
best he can, unnoticed...the meeting goes on as he goes under a table
to get the piece of equipment...he finishes just as there's another
time-flash...as it ends, momentarily disoriented, he's discovered, and
captured.

      This would've matched what was in B2, as I'd intended. 
Unfortunately, it added several minutes of screen time that I couldn't
afford.  I would've had to cut something somewhere else, and that
script was so tight it screamed as it was.  So I had to fudge how I did
that and let the small inconsistency go.  The only other thing I
could've cut, the one moveable piece, was Sinclair trying to radio
Garibaldi at the end...and I didn't want to lose that.

                                                                  jms

      Thank you.  Yeah, the critics have been...well, unfair doesn't
quite seem to describe it.  Some of these reviewers are to legitimate
criticism as Auchwitz is to health spas.  Still, some of them have
actually begun to turn around.  They just totally dismissed us from all
serious consideration right from the start, some because we were SF,
some because we weren't ST.

      There's an old saying on Broadway theater: "Nobody but the
audience loved it."  And that's what counts.

      As far as the last five are concerned...they're an interesting
and mixed bag.  The first two are almost, but not quite stand-alones,
each has a couple/three stories going on, and one of each tends to lean
toward the arc. But the last three are seriously hardass.  They bring
you right to the edge, and you can see it coming quite clearly...then
drop you.

      David, you can say "it seems to me," but I'm telling you it
wasn't, not in relation to the scar.  And Sheridan wasn't a "backup"
for Sinclair, he was brought in specifically because I needed somene
who could and would do things in a different way, and had a different
arc.  If it was going to track 1-to-1 you wouldn't *need* a new
character.

      And the swipe Kosh took at Sheridan wouldn't be *nearly* enough
to cause a huge scar like that.

      You're connecting two unconnected incidents.

      Mainly just a feeling she had, best to check everything out for

      Thanks.  No, the first 3 Babylon stations never got much past
the very earliest stages of construction, just some hull elements, that
sort of thing, nothing that could be recognized.  Other forces took
them out, mainly for political reasons.

      It wasn't "airtight," it was "alright," which SHOULD have been

Subject: How Time Flies

      I've been going over my notes on the show, and just thought I'd
pass this along to the newer folks to show just how long this show has
been in the works.  In looking it all over, I'm already kind of
astonished at how large a chunk of my life this thing has consumed
already.

      1986: Babylon 5 is thunk up.

      1987: Pilot screenplay and series treatment written, artwork
commissioned.

      1987-1991: Five years wandering in the desert of studios and
networks, trying to sell B5.

      June 1991: We place Babylon 5 with PTEN.

      October 1991: B5 announced to the world.

      August 1992: Filming begins on B5 pilot movie.

      September 1992: Filming completed on B5 pilot, post production
starts.

      February 1993: Pilot airs.

      February 1994: First season begins airing.

      It's odd sometimes to consider that though this is the 3rd
season of Babylon 5, it's been a part of my life for 10 years, about
25% of my life; trying to sell it, selling it, making it.  And this
month marks about 5 years since we placed it with PTEN.

      Jeez, but that's a long haul....

                                                                  jms

they shouldn't be, in order that there might still be mystery in the

      Throughout the episode, whenever there's a tachyon burst, pretty
much everyone has a timeflash of one sort or another (as also mentioned
in Babylon Squared).

      Yeah, I know about the sleeve...and actually she didn't touch
him in WWE2.  It was one of those days when it was a hideous production

      No, the information is *not* true, and I sent Steve a note about
this. The meeting to renew/not renew B5 hasn't happened yet, though
it'll be happening shortly.  Some individual stations have signed on,
but that isn't the same thing as renewal, since WB will make its
decision based on the final number of stations that do sign on, vs.
those that don't, or those that put it in an unworkable timeslot.

      Yes, any other independent station in your area can pick up B5
if the current station stops carrying it.  This has in fact happened in

another picked it up and did much better with it.  And thanks.

literary device that's sometimes used by novelists that can be very

       With most of their systems down, everyone around her dead,
Sheridan dead, knowing she's about to die and there's nothing she can
do about it, and obviously knowing full well who's out there...about to
witness the deaths of a quarter million sentients on the station...I
felt a bit of an outburst, a final letting go of the emotions, was not
inappropriate for her. (Although I do think Claudia may have played it
a bit too hysterical at times; separate the lines from the performance
and look at it again.)

       There's not much point to asking me "when are we going to learn
who Delenn saw in her flashforward."  Or similar questions.  I will not
throw away the impact of something happening in an episode by blowing
it out in a message.  There have to be surprises along the way.  You'll
see it when it happens.

       No, WWE couldn't have been 3 episodes.  Yes, it had enough
story for it, and then some, but you can't take one storyline and
stretch it out that far.  I wouldn't have done it even if I could. 
I'd've had to introduce a B story just to break it up a little, because
3 hours of just a straight line one-story plot is murder.  And that
defeats the purpose of expanding it.

      The future Sheridan would have a little memory of what happened

"Joe, you are already *known* for B5 and, given two more seasons and
the repeat deal on TNT, you will only become more noticed.  Maybe this
will change in the future, but as of 1996 when people think of you they
will probably identify you with B5.  Knowing that you have accomplished

Straczynski, the guy who created Babylon 5?""

      It bothers me not at all.

      Every writer has one seminal work for which he or she is most
known. For Heinlein, STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND; for Herbert, DUNE; for
Smith, the LENSMAN books; for Tolkein, LORD OF THE RINGS; for Bradbury
THE MARTIAN CHRONICLES.  I don't put myself anywhere NEAR that
league...I'd be doing good just to carry their pencils...but my sense
is that even though I've done a lot of stuff prior to B5, and will
likely do a lot more after, this is almost certainly the one work for
which I'll be most known, and remembered.  (Which is also why I'm
working so hard to make it right.)

      Doesn't bother me at all; I'm proud and pleased to be associated

      If you check out some of the more experimental South American
magic realism and fantasy work, you'll find this used a bit more. 
Also, I believe that Pratchett and Gaiman's collaboration kind of began
at the ending (unless my memory is acting up again).

      My sense about getting out of TV when B5 is over is that I feel
I'd've said most of what I want to say for television.  The only things
that could keep me in would be an anthology, or something right on the
cutting edge, something with which we could make another kind of
history.  But those don't tend to come around very often....

      BTW, here's something to notice when you watch DTD again.  The
montage scene with Londo and G'Kar lasts, I think, 10 maybe 12 seconds.
But that one piece took John and me *hours* to put together.  Go
through frame by frame, and you'll see some of those bits are only 3 or
4 frames long (one second is 24 frames).  We were nearly blind by the
time we were done, but it was worth it.

      Simple logic.  Sheridan slid forward in time, to wherever he was
at that moment in the future.  He didn't just go hopping around
aimlessly; if he flipped 10 days ahead, he'd come into his body at that
point 10 days from now, wherever he happened to be.  At that moment, 17
years down the road, he happened to be on Centauri Prime.

{original post unavailable}

       What an interesting question....

       I don't think it *has* affected me, but that's my my subjective
point of view, and that's a self-serving analysis, so let's start from
the assumption that that may be flawed, and proceed from there.

       Main reason I think it hasn't affected or changed me is that I
haven't had *time* for it.  Once we got the go-ahead for the series, I
stuck my head in a B5 shaped hole in the ground and haven't had time to
come up for air yet. Once I've finished the show, and can take a moment
to look around, will I become a complete butthead?  Possible, but I
don't think so.

       My problem is the same as it's always been...I'm *extremely*
self critical.  The doofus in the mirror today, 3 years into B5 is the
same doofus I saw there 3-4 years ago.  I know the areas in which I'm a
jerk, and the areas in which I'm golden...they haven't changed much.  I
also have a hard time applying the reaction to *the show* to myself. 
The show is a thing apart, somehow.  Whenever someone thanks me for the
show, I tend to get kinda abashed about the whole thing...which is why
you don't tend to see messages from me elaborating on someone's
appreciation.  Usually it's just a "thanks" and we move on.  If I
wanted to feed that, or keep it going, I could do so. But for me, the
Babylon 5 universe has a certain reality about it, somewhere deep in my
brain, and I'm just writing down what happens there.  (No, I can still
tell fact from fiction...but I've just been living in that fictional 
place so long that it becomes second nature...imagine your best friend
walking across the den late at night, and banging his/her shin on the
coffee table. It doesn't take a great leap of imagination to figure out
what your friend will say in reaction...it comes naturally.  So do the
events in B5, by virtue of knowing the characters and the universe as
well as I do.)

       I will tell you a terrible but true thing: when I go to a
convention and take the stage...I never hear the applause.  I'm so
concerned with what I'm going to say, the need to find some way to
appear even *remotely* interesting when I know the reality is far from
it, to make sure these good people get their money's worth, a
performance...that I don't hear it, try as I might.  I want to, I would
like to...but it's as if it's intended for someone else, and he or she
couldn't make it, and I'm being thrust out onto the stage to substitute
for someone interesting.

       I think that if I've changed at all, it's to become a little
more cautious and introspective.  (Witness this message.)  As that
famous Greek philosopher Peter Parker once pointed out, "With power
comes responsibility." Because of this show, I have an unexpected
platform; so I have become more wary in how I use it in order to avoid
abusing it.  With that comes the desire to find ways to use it in a
positive fashion...to encourage other people to find their own dreams,
to ask questions and put out good information on how TV works, so that
people can better influence what they see and hear in this medium, and
get what they want, not what somebody *thinks* they want.

       Finally, I think I'm fairly aware of my relative position in
society; can there be any lesser celebrity than a producer, anything
more ephemeral than a television writer?  Between writing, prep,
shooting, and post, it takes us about 3 months to make one
episode...which is gone in an hour, phosphor dots sent cruising toward
Andromeda at the speed of starlight. It's been debated here before, but
I still hold fast to the notion that the really important people, the
ones doing the work that will influence the next hundred years, are the
teachers and the builders and the researchers who are creating the
*real* future, not writing about a fictional one.  I can write 1,000 
episodes of B5...and it won't cure one person of polio, that took Dr.
Jonas Salk.

       Television as a medium is too important to turn over to the
visigoths, can be used to great purpose...it can ignite controversy,
entertain, educate and ennoble; it can propel us toward the stars or
bring down a president.  But it is always ephemeral, of the moment; it
does not last, does not endure.  If you're very lucky, your show can
last 10 years before it becomes dated, out of style, behind the times. 
Where it can inspire people to do more with their lives in ways that
make a permanent difference, then it is of greater value, and that is
my hope for this show.

       But that's the show.  Not me.

       I'm still the doofus in the mirror.

                                                                  jms

      Thanks.  There's always a danger in trying too hard to teach, of
course, and I try to avoid that.  (It's just that I actually love
teaching.) Back a few years ago, when I still used to teach writing
here and there, I trained my class that when I started to go off and
start pontificating to excess, they were to say, as with one voice,
"Shuuuuuttt uppppp."

      Worked every time.

                                                                  jms

      I dunno...the last time I peeked through the mirror to the other
side all I saw was gears, wheels, fan belts and 27 pairs of yellow
slitted eyes.

      I think it's the difference between serving the council in
general, and being *on* the Council.

      (That's my story and I'm sticking to it.)

      Well...actually...none of those are it.

      And as an aside...please be careful, if story suggestions or
storylines get posted, it can cause me a problem.

      That aside...good thoughts, well considered.  And thanks.
