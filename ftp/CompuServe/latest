"I've seen the grousing (as you undoubtedly have) that "SiL" received
the nomination only because it was impossible to give the nomination to
the entire series and that it doesn't stack up against the other
nominated works for brilliance in advancing the SF in SF dramatic
works."

      My response would be two-fold: first, that I didn't know that
advancing SF in SF dramatic works was the requirement, only that it BE
SF.  The Truman Show, also nominated, doesn't present any new
ideas...heck, I did a TWILIGHT ZONE episode in 88 that had *exactly*
the same story and structure (simultaneous creation, I'm not saying it
was cribbed, it wasn't). ST:Insurrection likewise doesn't exactly
advance the field of SF by bringing in new ideas...it's another ST
movie, and the core is the fountain of youth idea, not exactly
innovative.  Pleasantville has its roots in the Purple Rose of Cairo,
the Last Action Hero and others.  Of all the other entries, I'd say 
only Dark City really does anything really innovative.

      But all are equally in the genre, and thus equally viable
candidates.

      As to what SiL might bring that advances the SF in SF dramatic
works, I'd say that it brings something quite new: an ending.  This is
the preplanned ending toward which the 5 years of B5 have been working.
We said at the beginning that B5 has a beginning, a middle, and an end.
All SF shows have a beginning, most have a middle...but this is
something new, an ending toward which all has been leading.  This
really hasn't been done before in SF TV.  B5 introduced the concept of
the 5 year arc to TV...this is the end of that arc, to which all has
been pointing.

      (Funnily enough, I think this is the first time that a Hugo
nominated entry has actually had a Hugo visible *in* it.)

                                                                  jms

      In the opening of act one, the camera pans around Ivanova's desk
to reveal her.  In foreground in that shot is a small area with several
of what look like medals or frame.  In the midst of that is a long
rocket pointing upward, on a round bronze disk.  That's the Hugo.  The
camera continues on past it to reveal her, so it's in the first few
moments of the act.

                                                                  jms

"I seem to recall reading in one of the B5 magazines that when JMS was
first trying to sell the idea of B5, he was aware that DS9 was also in
the pipeline, so to say that DS9 is a knock-off is not strictly true
although some of the later story lines are similar."

      Negative.  We began trying to sell the B5 series to everyone in
town, including Paramount, 5 years prior to getting a Go order.  The B5
series was announced in early November of that year.  There was NO set
ST series by that point.  Over the following Christmas weekend, I got a
phone call from someone very closely involved with Trek, who said,
"They just decided what the new Trek show is going to be.  It's about a
space station that's a center of commerce, with a travel gate nearby."

      So your information is quite incorrect.  Nor did it come from
the B5 magazine (there's only one).

"Still JMS must be quite pleased if it is a knock-off, as to copy ones
ideas is the greatest form of praise."

      Let me steal your car and see if you feel the same way
afterward.

"...infact I think it first aired about 6 weeks before the B5 pilot."

      Yeah, they pushed through their post production specifically to
beat us into the marketplace.

"I can certainly understand you being "devastated" to find out about
DS9 and am surprised, given the penchant for court action in the USA,
that you have never started legal action for plagiarism."

      It was discussed with WB for some time, but they felt that it
would be like getting into a protracted land war in Asia, and the
litigation might prevent B5 from getting a fair shot by being embroiled
in a conflict right out of the gate.

"As far as stealing your car is concerned, if your car was stolen you
would not have use of it. You still retained use of the B5 idea and the
fact that it is similar <g> to DS9 did not prevent it being produced."

      Actually, it almost did.  WB came within an inch of canceling
the whole thing because they weren't sure the market could sustain two
space station series.  It also hurt us in that fans thought that *we*
were the copycats, since we aired second.  And Paramount played a lot
of games with the stations to try and keep us off the air so they'd
have the field to themselves.  It took us almost two years to really
recover from the damage, it's still an annoyance that we seem to be
providing DS9 with R&D free of charge, and we still have a lot of fans
who think we copied them since our pilot aired second.

                                                                  jms

"I swear, the folks at TNT are being shown different versions of this
stuff than the rest of us.  It's the only way to explain some of this."

      We've gotten used to it.  Their promotions department is one of
the most inept I've ever seen.  I finally snagged the Crusade promo,
and not only did they make terrible selections of footage, a) about
half the footage isn't even FROM Crusade, it's from B5 and A Call to
Arms (inclusive of Keffer getting gakked in season 2), and b) the
little Crusade footage they DO use is repeated several times (first one-
frame each, then again, mostly people just standing around).

      We've delivered virtually all of the episodes, there's plenty of
stuff to draw on...why on *earth* would they go to B5 for footage?  And
why on earth would they use the same uninteresting Crusade footage
repeatedly, all this in a 20 second promo, where every second counts?

      The only possible answer I can come up with is that these
promotions people are totally and completely inept...which would
explain why the majority of their shows are doing terribly right now.

                                                                  jms

"The only thing I can think of is that they hope to catch the eye of
existing B5 fans by showing the footage."

      Given that the footage used was absolutely unremarkable --
guards standing outside the B5 council chambers, a woman in a starfury
cockpit from ItB, Keffer getting burned, a few others -- that prospect
seems thin at best.

      Actually, I've finally figured out TNT's marketing strategy for
Crusade, and I've come to realize that I'm wrong, it's an utterly
innovative and unprecedented campaign.

      See, the more PR you put out there about a show, the more you
are going to prejudice a potential audience for or -- possibly --
against the program. So the best way to combat this is to put out
little or no PR so that the audience can come to the show without *any*
prior preconceptions whatsoever.

      It's breathtaking, I tell you...breathtaking.

                                                                  jms

(PS, there's a very good Crusade article in the current issue of
Dreamwatch Magazine, from the UK but available out here, that really
gets into the nuts and bolts of what happened.)

      The numerical sequence was massively juggled due to changes and
stuff...so ignore the production numbers *entirely*.  We start at 108,
then go all over the place, with the final 5 being 103, 101, 102, 104
and ending on 105.  Just go by the titles.

"But you are saying that dispite the numerical sequence being

      They're somewhat stand alone that was introducing characters and

blowing up.  The ones that follow are much better.

      All that exposition is what TNT wanted...and one of the reasons
was that they weren't going to rerun ACtA before it...then they were,
which made it all unnecessary...then they ran ACtA AFTER the ep...which
makes NO kind of sense.

      It was all real footage.

      As for the exposition...one reason they asked for so much was
because they said it was going to air months after ACTA, and nobody'd
remember, and it wouldn't get rerun...then after we shot WZ they
decided they *would* rerun ACTA before WZ...then a few weeks ago they
decided to run ACTA -- which has all the info needed for WZ -- AFTER
WZ.

"In the scenes with the Senator on Mars I wasn't sure Cole was in the

editted back together from separate filmings?"

weren't any in that part, so we kind of borrowed some from earlier in
the sequence. We do this a lot, when there isn't coverage of some parts

"And yet I don't recall a scene in B5 in which you fragged the head of
ITN or any other network."

      No, but there were occasional little hidden messages in the
episode, as when a character says, "We've had to make some compromises
to get this show on the road."  No one noticed that one, despite being
rather literal.

      It's a good start...I think they were anticipating less, and so
was I, given the nearly total lack of PR.  It also built every
quarter...it went from 1.8 to 1.8 to 1.9 to 2.0 by the end of the show,
which means we held our audience and built.

      The real test will be next week...from what I understand, a lot
of folks didn't even know it was on until after the fact.

"Did you agree with this?"

      Nope.

"I admit, I'm one of the folks who didn't particularly warm to the
footage. It seemed not to fit."

      It didn't.  Moreover, the order for that stuff came in about two
days before we were supposed to begin shooting, so we had to hurriedly
redesign the set to include the wall monitor, and change other aspects
of the filming, then hurriedly find some footage that would work
(sorta).

"I suppose there were few options."

      None.  What you have to understand is that we were at this
point, in the writing of this episode, on hiatus...awaiting the okay to
go back into filming.  And though it was never said overtly, there was
always the undercurrent of "If TNT doesn't get this one script the way
they want it, they may not give the OK.  So give them what they want
just this one time."

      I did what I could with what they demanded, and tried to fight
as much as I could.  For instance, in one scene, where Gideon tells the
others to meet him in the conference room, the TNT note was, "How does
Gideon know where the conference room is?  We should have a scene where
he's shown the conference room."

      My reply: "He knows where the conference room is because when
he's escorted to the bridge by Matheson, *HE CAN SEE IT FROM HIS
CHAIR*."

      (It was one of those bang-your-head-against-the-wall moments.)

      The overall problem, which many folks don't understand, is that
in a script you have a finite number of minutes and pages.  Let's say
42 pages. Now, the script is written the way you want, kinda, with some
nice character moments and stuff.  Then they want more exposition.  You
can't just append it to the page count, you have to stay at 42 pages. 
So you have to cut stuff *out* to make room for the stuff they want put
*in*.  The first thing out the door is character, followed quickly by
humor.

      There was, for instance, a nice clash with the senator and the
intelligence guy over Gideon's background, why he's the wrong person
for the job, why Sheridan picked him specifically for the job...which
had to go in order to put in more exposition (and lengthen the opening
fight scene in the teaser by about a third, another TNT request).

      For me, a lot of what makes an episode fun are the character
moments, but there was no longer room for them...they had to go out to
make room for dry expositional stuff or stuff blowing up.

      Which is why I picked "The Long Road" as the one to follow in
the broadcast order...it's one big character piece, with a fair amount
of humor, and just fun.  A little expository in the second act, but
nothing unreasonable.

      Stil, I'm proud of what we did with "War Zone," because it was a
little like someone handing you an inner tube and a tree branch and
telling you to make a radio telescope out of it.  It ain't pretty, but
it does the job we had put in front of us.

      (One aside...some folks on the net picked up my comments about
War Zone made here earlier and said I was apologizing after the fact
for the episode, once the reactions came in...but the date stamp on the
message, here and on the nets, clearly indicate that I made those
statements BEFORE the episode aired.  I know *exactly* where the faults
are in the eps, where they work and where they don't work, and have
always tried to be the first one on record about them because that
seems right to me.  This is, after all, about the process of educating
people about how TV works, the decisions that get made and how you deal
with them.)

                                                                  jms

      Because something had to go time-wise to make room for other
stuff.  If we'd kept *that*, then something ELSE of similar time would
have to go, such as Dureena's scene in the cell with Gideon, or the
like.  The amount of air time we have per episode does not change.

                                                                  jms

      Sheridan picked him for the qualities that made him exactly the
*wrong* person from their point of view...obstinate, difficult,
independent, not prone to following orders from home, not politically
astute...but he'll get the job done.

                                                                  jms

      I just finished reviewing his sountrack CD demo, and I like it. 
I think it'll go over well.

"Are there any more materials on Crusade coming out?  Comics?
Cards....  Have you considerd continuing the story as a series of
books?  The Del Rey publications have been nice."

      The technomage trilogy follows Galen through his training,
becoming a full-fledged technomage, through the shadow war exodus, and
into the events of Crusade...and the Centauri trilogy also gets into a
lot of Crusade territory, both trilogies involving a secret behind
Galen's involvement in our story.

      The word "limited" was their choice to try and put a positive
spin on things from their side, "Oh, we meant to do it this way."

      And we probably won't have any clearer ideas on the future of
the show until the very last minute, around the second week of July. 
That's typical TV business stuff these days.

      We got a 1.4 on The Long Road, which from what we're being told
was down because of being up against the first night of the NBA Finals;
the East Coast was down as a result, so the numbers dropped even though
they were about right for the west coast.  And the demographics are
great.  (Everything on TNT's lineup and elsewhere got hit by the
Finals, and of all that, we got hit generally the least of everyone.)

      Interestingly enough, I just got a note from one of the people
at SPACE, the Canadian channel carrying Crusade, and he says that the
ratings on WarZone *doubled* the usual B5 ratings (which were very good
to start with).

1.  I understand how a blue screen is used for optical effects. Many
    times on Entertainment Tonight (or other shows in this genre) they
will
    do a behind-the-scenes story and I notice that a green screen is
being
    used.  Why use a green screen over a blue screen?

      Green is often used for video, blue for film.  And if you have
blue uniforms, you can't shoot bluescreen behind them.

2.  A strange questions concerning commercials, TV shows, and movies. 
When
    a car is shown driving on a road, the road appears to have been
hosed
    down with water.  On one hand, it may have rained before shooting
began.
    But on the other hand, what are the odds that it always rains
before a
    commercial is filmed!!  Do they water down the road to improve
lighting?

      It looks cooler.

      The original air order would have spread out the Galen episodes,
so that he would appear every second or third episode...that changed
with the short order, and they all got bunched together.

"Is it possible to have Babylon 5 moved back into syndication? I'm
sure many networks would give B5 the respect it deserves. I know the
local station here always supported B5 from the beginning. They also
advertised it on the network many times. The reason I ask this is
because I have seen ER in syndication on a local network while its also
shown on TNT."

      No, I think they bought it exclusively,

"Have your plans for making a Babylon 5 Theatrical Movie been moved
because of Crusade? I've read that you are waiting till all the Star
Wars movies are released before considering a B5 movie."

      I'm in no rush.

{original post unavailable}

      Not really, no...I always imagined that Z'ha'dum was originally
the Minbari word for the place, and the Z'ha has echoes in Entil-zha
and Isil-zha. The dum (doom) part is obvious.  Not to say I wasn't
aware of Khazad-dum, but it wasn't on my mind at the time.

"I'm very curious where Joe's going with Galen's character."

      Actually, Galen has quite a secret he's carrying around with
him.  It formed the basis of scripts 114 ("To the Ends of the Earth")
and 116 ("End of the Line," which would've been the cliffhanger).  It's
also a major element of the coming technomage novels.  There's a very
small reference to it in the episode airing this week, when Galen
mentions that he and someone else have been "betrayed by our own kind."

      It also ties into why they were in such a rush to get the hell
out of known space during the shadow war.

      Thanks, this one is a favorite of mine as well.  It was one of
the scripts written while we were still shooting the first 5, before
TNT got into the process.  When that happened, they made it clear that
they *hated* this story, felt that nobody would be interested in all
this backstory...and asked for it all to be taken out, let them run
into this alien and make him an evil character, an emotional vampire
who drives them insane.

      This was one of the first scripts where I dug in my heels
bigtime and refused to do what they asked.  I knew it would be
powerful; they thought it would be utterly uninteresting.  They were
wrong.

      Re: the Matheson scene...that one was cut back by about 40%
because the episode ran long.  (That sometimes happens on dialogue-
intensive episodes.) The original version had it go over a longer
period of time, and showed him coming over gradually.  It is a bit
abrupt as it is now, though I still think it plays.

      A device that small would run out of power if it were on all the
time, and might be detected.  My feeling was that it was switched off
and had to be removed to power it up, then the telepathic signal would
activate the beacon and bring in the troops.  You'd have a two-stage
process to a) avoid detection, and b) ensure that if it *were* found it
couldn't be used by anyone else to stage a trap.

I posted this elswhere, and figured I'd put it here as well, even
though it's not technically B5 per se.

A quick update on the latest RISING STARS news:

I've now seen the inked and colored final pages on issue 1, and I have
to say that I'm very, very pleased by the final result.  It took a bit
of doing to get there, but the result is quite nice.  It has the *feel*
of a very different sort of book than everything else out there,
something a bit special.

That first issue of RISING STARS, "Nova Placenta," will debut at the
Chicago Comic Con in two weeks, where I'll be attending and signing
stuff and talking and the like.  (My main presentation has been moved
from Sunday to Saturday at around 5ish, I think.)

It will hit comic stores/newsstands around the 28th of this month.

Advance orders have already topped 100,000 (before re-orders) and it
looks like that may not be enough.

This is a comic that I feel very strongly about, it's something I've
wanted to do for a long, long time.  I think it's something that will
appeal to most B5 folks, because it has many of the same elements in
the sense that it treats the genre seriously, tries new and different
approaches to characterization, has an overall story arc with a
beginning, middle and end (24 issues from now), and so on.  I think
it'll appeal equally to non-comics fans and those familiar with the
form.  It's also something that I think can be read by a variety of age
ranges, all of whom will get something different out of it.

In any event...I'm very happy with the thing, and wanted to put the
word out there about it.

I'm especially pleased that the first issue will have a forward by
Neil Gaiman, a name that should be familiar to both B5 folks ("Day of
the Dead") and comics readers around the planet.

The book is being published by TOP COW (a division of Image Comics,
publisher of SPAWN), also the publishers of FATHOM and DARKNESS.  It
should be available at any goodly-sized comics store, and there are
several places on-line where one can find comics.

It's gonna be a fun book.

      Because they're totally independent organizations (that's how
Time/Warner is structured), and one division cannot force another to
do anything.  It is, in my view, just a tad dysfunctional.

"Normally I would say this is good, but if the parent company is
loosing money through this, you would imagine that the parten company

      Part of the WB/B5/TNT hassle has always been getting caught in
the switches on who IS the parent.  Time/Warner says we own TNT (which
they do), but then TNT says the biggest shareholder in TW is...Ted
Turner (which is also true).  Part of this massively ugly struggle has
been that fight for power, and we've been kind of the football on many
occasions.

      I haven't heard on the ratings yet, because everybody kinda
split early for the 4th holiday, but I wouldn't be surprised at all if
it came in well under a 1 rating, since it didn't air until midnight on
the East Coast, a number of folks didn't know it had been moved and
tuned in at the usual time, and many of those who did know about the
change gave up on waiting on the draft's conclusion.  GIven all that, I
would be *vastly* surprised if it did even a .7 or so.

1. Rising Star #0 and #1 were out but are no longer available.

      The 0 issue was published in the Wizard Magazine FATHOM special
a couple months ago and can still be found; the Preview issue was
published in a special limited edition around the same time and is
harder to find.

2. They are very late and there is no release date.

      Issue 1 was put back one month so it could debut at the Chicago
comic con next weekend (where I'll be attending).  It will hit comic
stores July 28th.

3. They aren't being published.

      Bull ka-ka.

      It's only ever going to be seen by the general, and bear in mind
that in that shot Chambers was WAY in the background, it was only seen
for a moment on the monitor, with the General more concerned about
what's happening in FG, and in any event he would have to instantly
recognize her by sight, and he didn't know her.

      Have the actor's options expired?  Yes.  Does this close the
door?  No, another channel could say yes even after #13, it would just
mean negotiating new contracts, which is quite do-able.  If it happens
I can deal with it; if not, I have plenty of other options.  I've never

"I think part of what I was trying to ask is, what do *you* want about
Crusade?  Do you really want to continue it, or would you be just as
happy to move on?  You've actually had several months in "moving on"
mode, it seems.  I don't think I'm getting my questions out of
sequence.  You've been answering "who are you?" in this forum since
before I joined.  So I'll still ask, "what do you want?"  In a very
limited context."

      You have to understand that the only thing I want, the only
thing I've *ever* wanted, is to tell good stories about interesting
characters.  I'm fairly simple that way.  I would love to continue
telling stores in the B5 universe...but then, I'd love to tell stories
in *other* universes.  If one market stays open, I'll stay there...if
it closes, I move on.  It's what I've always done.

      Would I like to keep doing Crusade?  Sure, but not under the
conditions that made these 13 eps so onerous.  I have a real simple
philosophy: if it ain't fun, don't do it.  Because this job is too hard
to do it if you're not enjoying the process.

      It's all about story.  Since Crusade stopped I've been offered a
couple of exec producer gigs on other shows, but passed on them because
they weren't really stories I either wanted to do or that I felt I
could do a good job with.  One gig that I *did* want I just missed out
by an inch because at the last moment some big names came into the
scenario and they got the gig (and they will probably do very well with
it).  Them's the breaks.  You wait for a show to come along you would
like to do, meanwhile you try to get your own show off the ground.

      Which is where I am now.  I'm in the final stages of negotiating
a deal for one series pilot (98% mainstream 2% speculative fiction)
that would be as innovative as what I did with B5...it's a story
nobody's ever done before, and it's been fast-tracked.  I literally
thought it up two weeks ago, had one meeting about it with a major
entity (known to everyone), did a rough treatment, and 3 days later
they called to start negotiations on the deal. If that goes, I'll be
excited, because it's something utterly on the bleeding edge not just
storywise but in terms of production and EFX and it's on a huge scale.

      In any event, as I said, in the end, it's simply about telling
stories, in conditions that allow me to do my best work.  "The exercise
of vital powers along lines of excellence in a life affording them
scope," to quote the Greek definition of happiness.

                                                                  jms

"I paid a price for my eagerness in reading this story before any of
the others in this issue. You can say so much in so few words, that
afterwards I found myself a bit impatient with the wordiness of a
couple of the other stories, which lessened my enjoyment of them. I've
learned to make every word count from the rigorous demands of article
word limits.  Am I correct in guessing that you learned it mainly from
writing screenplays?"

      That's about half it, the other half being a background in
journalism, where you learn to get to the point quickly and
efficiently.  I'm actually quite pleased with the story.

"I've also just read the page proofs of Final Reckoning to review it
for B5 magazine. I would have read it  in one sitting, except that
around page 175 I had to take a break. I was afraid I would start
hyperventilating. 'Nuff said, until we can all talk about it here."

"Can (will) you tell us about Fiona Avery's connection to B5 and
Crusade? I just picked up the first PsiCorp novel and she was in the
dedication. Got me to wondering..."

      We brought Fiona aboard during the last part of S5 as a
reference editor to keep the continuity straight, and for Crusade
(about which more in a bit). There was a growing problem keeping the
licensees and licensed material accurate; stuff slipped through the RPG
books and elsewhere (this was before she got here).  She was brought on
to stop the problem, and to annoy the licensees in the sense that it's
often easier not to get things right, and she has to stay on top of
them and make them crazy in order to ensure that the accuracy the fans
(and I) expect is maintained.

      She was also brought on with an eye toward Crusade because she
has a degree in Archaeology and Crusade's an archaeological SF series. 
Along the way, she began writing spec scripts for Crusade which ended
up being good enough to buy, and we bought 4 of which 2 were produced,
Well and Patterns. The last one she did, Value Judgments, was probably
the best of the bunch; it's a Bester script that Walter considered one
of his best roles, and would tie in directly with the Psi Corps books.

"In the last episode were all the references to color schemes and the
new uniforms a deliberate poke at Star Trek?  The colors of the new
uniform are a cross between the jackets that Captain Picard wore and
the colors of the cadet's uniforms.  And the reference to being able to
breath in the high collars which were part of the NG uniform from about
season 2 on.  I don't know if it was intentional but you got a snicker
out of me."

      No, it had nothing to do with ST, it was a shot at TNT.

Star Trek New Frontier book series which started in 1997 is call the
U.S.S. Excalibur?"

given the lead time of a magazine like that).  All during production
they kept talking about the first six episodes being their main
interest, which signaled then what's happened since, that they wouldn't
support it past the first 6, which is the bare minimum required.

      I have no information yet on whether it'll finally end up
somewhere else; could be, might not, no way to know.  Either way, I'm
sanguine.  All I can do is make the show that I feel I have to make for
reasons of conscience, to the best of my ability to make it.  I did
that.  There are other projects in the works, so if it doesn't go, or
if it does, either way I'm covered.

"As Gideon was preparing Greenberg's body for Airlock'nLoad,the

      Yep.  But since the body couldn't talk aloud, it couldn't
communicate this effectively.

into a long dissertation of what would've been...because what would be

"I disliked the actions of the EA strip mining the planet at the
expense of the people living there, and liked Gideons solution to it. 
But it begs the question, "How long do you keep being polite when there
are billions of lives at stake?"
"That's the potential of the arc that has been set up here.  As time
passes, the EA is going to be under more and more pressure to find a
cure by any means possible.  That may mean by violent means at times. 
This will mean conflicts between the members of the IA and even
conflicts within the EA itself."

      Exactly.

      As Eilerson said, "Wouldn't you sacrifice a hundred Narns to
save Earth?"  It was a question Gideon didn't answer.

      Because there IS no one Warner Bros.  It was constructed as a
series of competing and structurally independent fiefdoms...WB Domestic
TV competes with the WB Network and so on.  Each division actively
competes and to a large degree won't *cooperate* with other divisions. 
A network also wants its own stamp on the development process, so they
simply wouldn't take another show they didn't develop, from a competing
division.

"JMS has hinted elsewhere that the cure might be found before the end

turn out not to be the show we're actually watching.  Put these two
together, and I wonder greatly if, had the next few years played out,

      Unfortunately, the syndicated market has become much more
crowded and much tighter since B5 went on the air, with Tribune and Fox
and UPN and others now claiming vast tracts of exclusive airtime. 
Which is a long way of saying there's no room in syndication.

      No, if that were to happen, it won't make a major difference,
since at most a few hundred people will ever see the script, and that
ain't hardly a blip on the ratings.  More folks than that see a script
when it's sent out for actors to use for auditions.

"I have seen that concept before, but with the last five supposedly
being the first five intending to be shown, how do they rationalize the
uniform change? The order shown has them going from the nice looking
dark uniforms to the ugly things of late.  Were they going to change
back or were they really shown in order, just not the production order
(or the 'preferred' order)?"

      It's not a "concept," it's what happened.  "Appearances" was
written to set up the change to the grey original uniforms, and we
would've gone to black again in "To the Ends of the Earth."

      I appreciate all of that...at the same time, however, what you
suggest would mean, in a sense, taking advantage of the fans to some
extent, charging for not getting much, and a) I can't do that, and b) I
think the majority, however attached to the show, would not want that
situation.

      In time, if we can get the thing into the black, we will
certainly revisit the structure of the thing and see what can be done
at that time.

"I read in SFX August 99 the only response I've heard from TNT. They
claimed they were promised, and though they were buying, a high paced
action series, and got something a lot slower. So that's why they
cancelled it."

      You've seen the final five (the first five produced, and the
show the way we wanted to make it)...do YOU think it was a slow
program? That it wasn't high-paced action?  If not, then one begins to
wonder at the honesty of the statement.

      Though anything in SFX regarding B5 or TNT is going to be
specious at best.  When they exceeded the snark-limit, early when
Crusade was still in production, with endless cheap personal shots and
the like, we phantom zoned them, meaning they were cut off from press
kits, photos, and interviews... after which they would take any
possible opportunity to go after me or my shows.

      The only thing wrong with your argument is that it doesn't have
anything to do with why and what TNT did, which stems from incompetence
and testosterone, not logic or business.

      Re: the B5 reruns...yes, the ratings dropped, because they would
run 5 in a row, then rerun the same five right afterward, rather than
giving it a good run, so you're showing eps that just aired a few weeks
earlier, and which everyone's seen.  And on top of that, you have your
on-air ads announce "all new episodes," when they're those very same
reruns, and you can onlyh pull that crap so many times before people
give up...and on top of THAT they began moving it all over the schedule
to the point where even *I* didn't know when it was on at various
points....

      The series had done well enough in the ratings, and had grown,
across four seasons.  When did it run into problems?  When it hit TNT. 
The primary reason that it was initially going to end with S4 was
because PTEN was gone, the WB network didn't want competition in the
marketplace, and the distribution mechanism was effectively gone. 
That's why TNT *bought* a fifth season, because it had been doing well.
And it's done extremely well, up to and including S5, everywhere else
on the planet *except* TNT.  That kind of points to the reality that
the problem was in how TNT handled it.

      As for Crusade...because we wouldn't make it the show TNT wanted
 -- Baywatch meets Wrestling in Space -- they wrote it off and did
everything they could to make damned sure it wouldn't succeed, because
if it DID succeed, it would prove that we were right and they were
wrong, and they absolutely would not allow that to happen.  And since
they never coughed up much in the way of production money -- leaving
nearly all of that to WB to pick up -- they had nothing to lose in
doing so.

                                                                  jms

"What is it with SFX regarding B5/Crusade?  I've noticed that, aside
from rare lapses into good taste, they seem to adopt a hostile, or at
best, cool tone towards you/the show.  Was there any specific event
that triggered this?  It was quite noticeable and rather puzzling."

      As noted in my prior message, it's specifically because we
phantom zoned them because many of their articles were, quite simply,
unfair and sometimes cheap shots masquerading as objectivity.  I don't
mind if somebody does or doesn't like a show or an episode, I got no
beef with that...but some of what was being done by them was wrong, I
felt...and finally, they were cut off from all PR material for Crusade.
At which point they went balls out to attack the show, or myself, at
any given opportunity; it's got nothing to do with journalism and
everything to do with being pissed-off jumped-up fanboys.

      By contrast, Dreamwatch has often had both good and bad things
to say about the show, but always one gets a sense that they're being
fair about it, and that their criticisms are well considered and as a
result are often hard to argue with.  As opposed to SFX, which takes
cheap ad hominum shots at anyone who even writes in to dare and say
they like B5 or Crusade.  You can tell that it's personal with
them...and the moment it becomes personal, you can kiss goodbye even
the pretension to journalistic integrity.

      When the situation came out about some B5 cast members not being
paid for their appearances at VorCon, Dreamwatch went out and
independently verified the situation.  SFX, because it's close with
some of the people involved with VorCon, did not.  This is typical of
their bias.  And that bias and that open negativity is, I think, why
their circulation is reportedly shrinking while the circulation of some
of the other magazines, notably Dreamwatch, is increasing, especially
here in the States.

                                                                  jms

      One of the main questions I get at conventions, when I show up
flying the colors, is "Where can I get that jacket?"  As those've
who've been there will attest, my answer has always been, "You can't. 
They're only for cast and crew."

      So there've been a lot of requests for this particular item over
the years...so for this month only, www.thestation.com will be offering
a limited number (about 200) of B5 jackets.  These are essentially
identical to the other crew jackets, same material, same manufacturer,
same detailed logo embroidered on the back.  It's a *nice* jacket (and
available for a hell of a lot less than the $500-1000 some of them have
been sold for in the past on ebay and convention auctions).

      But they're going to go fast.  Same as with the Gathering
script, which was only available in September, and is now off market. 
(The next one for sale, this month only, is the script for Midnight on
the Firing Line.)

the organization into re-abolishing the award.  It's a very sorry
mess."

      Of course.  It's SFWA.

      Never have I seen a group that writes about technology so
frightened of a form of technological storytelling.  They're the writer-
equivilents of Luddites.  (Meaning the ones pulling this crap.)

Subject: Is there a Best Episode?

{original post had no questions}

"As to "The Matrix", I think you may be betting on the winner there,
but strangely I found the story a trifle weak.  Perhaps because it was
so overshadowed by the extravagant visual effect.  I'd hate to have to
pay the tab for just 10 seconds of that film."

      The story is fairly straightforward and parts of it do not bear
close scrutiny, but the mythology of the thing is very well done, and
obviously the action stuff is the best I've ever seen.  The DVD is
particularly cool; it has the movie, commentaries, the ability to dive
out of the movie to see the sequence done segment by segment, then see
the whole thing, and you can see it from script to storyboard to filmed
end-product.  I've probably watched the whole thing through about 4-5
times.

      As much as I have a personal investment in Crusade and all
things Babylonian, I can't think of much that could compete with the
Matrix in terms of quality.

      (And to the question of what episode I'd consider...absent the
Matrix for a moment, it occurs to me that A Call to Arms and River of
Souls are both also elibigle for this year.)

"By the way, I note that SiL clearly does refer to 'events that had
not yet happened when SiL was filmed '.  For example, there's Lennier's
death. (Remember that Lennier is toasted as one of the 'absent friends,
in memory still bright'.)  Franklin being the head of Xenobiology back
on earth. Garibaldi being head of Edgar's Industries (although this is
implicit in 'Rising Stars')."

      Exactly so.  Franklin's situation even predates any thought at
all about Crusade as a series.

      Garibaldi's death (a much quieter passing than he would have
imagined waiting for him), Franklin's final fate on a distant,
unexplored planet, Delenn's final journey (a quest involving Valen,
though no one else around her believes it), Lennier's sacrifice...it's
all mapped out, on the theory that whether or not it ever gets used,
*I* had to know it.

      (Incidentally...in a coming issue of the B5 magazine, there is a
canonical timeline that covers the history of the B5 universe from the
Big Bang to a million years in the future...and it's really nifty to
see the whole thing laid out like that, to realize that, sonuvagun, it
really does work.  I commend it to everyone in the highest possible
terms.)

      Not that I've heard, in terms of production, though in terms of
story arc, the guys who do E:FC have said in print that they want to do
a B5 style arc, and a few others are doing the same.

Subject: B5 Bible/Treatment!

Also posted to the net:

For the last six years, I've been asked repeatedly -- in email and at
conventions -- "Are you ever going to make the original B5 series
writers' bible available?"  My general reaction was to simply
say...maybe someday.

After considerable reflection, and as a Solstice present to B5
viewers... we're finally going to make it available.

TWO such *its*, to be precise.

First: The original Babylon 5 Series Treatment

This is the 23 page document, written in September 1988, that was used
to sell the series for the five years it took to find a buyer.  It has
different characters than were ever seen in the show, such as Dr.
Chakri Mendak (a role that later became Dr. Stephen Franklin) and more
background on Vice-Commander Laurel Chang... Sinclair's background is
also quite different from what we eventually ended up with... Delenn
was a male...the Vorlons were warlike, squabbling aliens....

This was the first attempt to put B5 down on paper, in a process that
would change and evolve over the next 5 years. Ideas that were never
used, characters who would never be seen again, the first stirrings of
the Minbari War story (including a never used alternate explanation for
why they surrendered), Delenn was a male character... Kosh had a mate
who came with him to B5...on and on and on.

Second: The original Season One Babylon 5 Writer's Bible

This massive tome weighs in at over 60 pages, with comprehensive
backgrounds on all the characters as well as guidelines for writing SF
for TV in ways that would be different than all of our predecessors. It
lays out the first year of the arc and warns potential writers away
from areas we plan to explore in later years, has additional
backgrounds on regular characters never actually used in the series
(such as a strange fellow named Mr. Jones who would have been
alternately a bane and ally to Garibaldi), stories that would
eventually be filmed, other stories that would never be used,
information on the the history and technology of the B5 universe, Psi
Corps, Earthforce, the various governments, and other areas...this is
the Big One, the Grail of the B5 fictional world.  The table of
contents alone covers 2 pages.

This bible was ONLY given to prospective writers, who were in turn
asked to keep the material totally confidential. The treatment was ONLY
given to network/studio. heads and others in a position to buy the
series.

In addition, BOTH of these documents will be peppered with the
original illustrations by Peter Ledger used to sell and visualize the
series in its earliest stage, including the original keyhole logo, many
of them reproduced in full color, others b&w.  Some of these images
have shown up in various places, but others will be seen here by the
world at large for the first time.

I debated long and hard about whether or not I would ever make these
available, but finally decided to give in to the many requests for the
release of this material.

This material will shortly be made available at www.thestation.com and
via phone orders. I don't know how long we'll make them available, but
I suspect it may not be very long.

In reading through the documents, it's like taking a trip back through
time to what was, to the very beginnings of the series, what would be,
what might've been, what never was...what got abandoned on the side of
the road, what was kept. At times the material is coy, informative,
deliberately misleading in a couple of places where I wanted to avoid
leaks, rude and sometimes it actually makes a rough kind of sense.

They're going to cost a bit more than the scripts, because at 60+
pages in the case of the bible, and with the color illustrations,
they're more expensive to produce, and we're only doing a limited
number of these.

Expect the full info to go up on thestation.com in a few days.

      It's nothing to do with Crusade as a *product*.  It's Crusade
and the writing thereof as an *art form* that is at issue here.  If a
composer was stopped from finishing a symphony, and someone said,
"Well, can you talk about what you *would* have done?" it's an
impossible question...a symphony is meant to be *heard* not talked
about.

      Further, it would mean my spending a great deal of time dwelling
on something that I won't be able to *do*.  For me, it's not an
academic exercise, it's a point of great personal frustration...why in
heaven's name should I choose to enhance that any further by dwelling

"In all fairness I will admit to one problem I have in B5 plotdom and
I would like to know if this bothers anybody else? Why doesn't Sheridan
remember that Londo has a freakin Keeper. How can you go forward in
time and remember that Delenn says "do not go to Z'ha'dum" but you
forget that a one-eyed, ugly, creepy looking sucker is sticking out of
someone's neck. I mean I don't think that is something I would forget.
I mean Franklin found a Keeper on Mars and I assume he put it in a
report which I assume Sheridan read - he should be able to put 2 and 2
together. Has anyone ever raised this issue or read an explanation from
JMS on this - Mr. Straczynski, are you out there - what's the deal? Is
this going to be elaborated on in the "Legions of Fire" series? Just 
wonderin'"

      It's real simple.  That vision was almost 20 years in the
future.

      At what point should Sheridan assume the Keeper landed on Londo?
For all he knows, it got there a week before.  Nothing in Londo's
behavior in the present B5 storyline says "keeper."  People start wars
all the time without the necessity of having keepers.  Londo has
certainly had his changes and swings in mood prior to having a Keeper. 
WE know this because we have privileged information which Sheridan does
not.

      If Londo had said "I got this thing in x-year," then that's one
thing, but absent that...there's no way for Sheridan to know that he
didn't get it 10 or 15 years down the line...and, equally, no way to
know what future events he might change -- possibly for the worse -- by
trying to warn Londo. (And, in fact, if he did try to tell Londo about
this, the Drakh would realize that Londo had been compromised, and they
would probably simply kill him and bring someone else into that
role...so Sheridan's right in that respect.)

Subject: Unauthorized books?

{original post unavailable}

      I think that unauthorized books fall into a grey area; on the
one hand, they're exploiting a known commodity (a show) but none of the
creative people involved with the project actually benefit from the
book; that's sort of the bottom-feeder aspect to the thing...on the
other hand, an unauthorized book can sometimes (but may not always) be
more objective in telling the story of a given show.  I've generally
tried to make sure that anything associated with B5 is more than just
fluff; the B5 magazine is probably the best example of this, and
they've shown both the warts and the good stuff, and have in fact 
published any number of very critical articles and reviews of episodes 
(teeth-grindingly so, in some cases, but I let it go through on
principle).

      The Lane books fall into the "may not always be more objective"
category stated above, especially the second one, in which the author,
feeling that the series didn't go the way *he* would've wanted it to
go, totally distorts situations and events to underscore his theme,
even at the expense of honest reporting.  The whole book is, frankly,
skewed and even fans have considered it mainly a personal
attack/fannish venting than a book about the show...it's about the
author's frustrated desires and not about the show at all, in the final
analysis.  There's a lot of incorrect information in the book, which
in an authorized book could have been caught, but here there was no
safeguard against misinformation and personal opinion disguised as
fact.

                                                                  jms

"But, like you, I was rather taken aback by the attitude of the author
in the second book.  He was clearly miffed and allowed that to color
what could otherwise have been a well done second book.  Clearly, the
objectivity was gone."

      Yup.

"Still, he did manage to put in a couple of things worth seeing.  In
particular, he quoted the entire 'Declaration of Principles' from
'Paragon of Animals'."

      Which a) he didn't write, b) I did, and get nothing for the
reuse of my material, c) is widely available online, and d) can be
transcribed by anyone from the episode, so you don't need the book to
do that.

It was okay...I never much like the way I look or talk on TV.  I

Apparently the segment producer was a big B5 fan, so she called one

No, I just sleep whacky hours.  I generally work in the evenings until
