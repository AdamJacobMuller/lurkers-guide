      That's Harlan...that's how he is most of the time.  And yeah, I
got in my stuff earlier.  When Harlan gets a full head of steam going,
best to just get out of the way and watch with wonder.  I think it's a
couple of months old, though I don't know if this is a first or second
run of it.

      She asked for things that were not in our power to give, and
when they were not received, she passed on the offer to return.

      I really don't think you can think in those terms, either way. 
You pick up the tools of the *story*, not the tools of the *analysis of
the story*, and as you begin to line them up, you may have a sense of,
"Okay, this character is something of an archetype, so I need certain
elements to come into this, but only in service of the story."  I find
that what truly makes for myth does not come from conscious effort, but
from *unconscious* effort, this is where Jung's notion of a collective
unconscious comes into play.  We may not know *why* a sword raised by a
bloodied soldier over a battlefield strewn with bodies has power with
us, it's enough to know that it *does*.  When you ride a bicycle,
you're not thinking about pressure vs. force or force = propulsion, or
how many cycles per minute equals X-speed, you're just Riding The
Bike.

      Actually, Carl is correct.  If you're going to be realistic, a
captain in this position would be in her late 30s or early 40s, which
definitely puts Kristen out of the running.  I don't want to do a
Wesley and stick somebody way too young into an unrealistically high
position.

      I wouldn't cast someone who was less than ideal for the role. 
If you don't find the right person, you just keep going until you *do*.
We had a goodly amount of time on this one, and we saw a LOT of very
talented people. But she rose right to the top.  We put her in
secondary auditions with our other top contenders, and she blew *them*
out.  Then we put her in a scene with Jerry Doyle, in one of their
nose-to-nose, toe-to-toe confrontational scenes, and I told her to pull
out all the stops and try to bury her...and Jerry can be a very strong
presence when he wants to be.  She held her ground and gave back as
good as she got, maybe more.  And at the end, even Jerry said, "It's
her."

Subject: DS9 = Babylon 5

{original post unavailable}

       I was irritable about it at first.  Very much so, since it
jeapordized B5 ever being picked up as a series.  We had a huge battle
to fight on the premise that there was room enough for two space SF
series (virtually all the studios had conceded that one), then to say
that there was room for, and the market could sustain, two *space
station* SF series, well, suffice to say it caused us a lot of hassle.

       But in the final analysis, you come down to some basic
fundamentals. First, it comes down to making a good show.  I'd rather
compete in the marketplace of free ideas; if we make a good show, it'll
succeed...if not, not, and it's a moot point.  Second, as much as I may
suspect that the development of DS9 was guided by some of the execs at
Paramount who had access to all our material, I don't *know for sure*
that it was...and if you're going to be fair you *have* to allow for
the possibility of simultaneous, independent creation.  So I'm fairly
sanguine about it, as much as can be, anyway.

                                                                  jms

"But we *don't* have to follow the US Navy command structure, or
faithfully capitulate the command structure of ANY historical service. 
B5 is a fictional universe.  And I maintain that by the internal logic
of that fictional universe, a younger captain would not entirely be out
of line."

      Speaking as the guy who made up that internal logic and that
fictional universe...there is a profound difference between the
examples you were citing from the Revolutionary and Civil Wars and the
situation in B5.  To command a starship you have to have experience in
combat situations, and also in how to be level-headed enough to talk
your way out when you have to.  The average career military person may
enter at 18 years of age, or wait until finishing college or OTS
(Officer Training School) at 20-21.  You may enter respectively as an
ensign, or as a Lieutenant, and be assigned to your first unit at that 
point.  This has nothing to do with any particular country's military
scheme as simply with the math involved.

      Promotion in EVERY military is based in large measure on combat
experience.  (Which is why women officers are fighting so hard to get
access to battlefield postings.)  Working your way up the ranks simply
takes *time*.

      There's a profound difference between an Air Force captain, who
is responsible only for his own plane, and a Captain of a large vessel
who must command a staff and be responsible for the lives of hundreds
of crew members. Before they will entrust you with that responsibility,
you have to have proven yourself over the long-haul.  This is all the
more true with something like B5, where the CO also operates as a
military governor of sorts.  With a quarter-million lives on the line,
a person in his or her 20s simply does not have the years of experience
required for the job...and there is no way to gain that experience
other than with time.  It's not strictly a question of maturity, it's a
question of experience as well, and the bureaucracy that comes with
*any* military structure that says "you must pay your way, and earn 
your stripes."

      Just because something is SF doesn't mean we must throw away
*external* logic in our attempt to make the *internal* logic into
something just because we want it to be so.

                                                                  jms

{original post had no questions}

      No, it isn't specifically or exclusively based on the US Navy,
no, but also bear in mind that if you're going to look outside the US
military system, you will find that promotions generally take even
*longer* than in our own system...so that may not be in the best
interests of your argument.

                                                                  jms

       You're mixing up your terms.  You don't use "better" in the way
that you are using them here.  You look for the actor who most embodies
the character you're looking for.  When we were casting Cartagia, for
instance, there were several actors who you could look at and say,
"Okay, this actor has more technique than *that* actor."  But that
ain't the issue.  Wortham Krimmer is mainly noted for being an actor on
daytime soap operas, and he was competing against people trained at the
Royal Shakespeare Academy in some cases.  The latter may have been more
classically trained...but Wortham WAS Cartagia.

       And we knew it in the first five minutes.  The hard part was
then sitting through all the other auditions knowing that we had
already decided instantly on Wortham.

       The casting director's job is to winnow down the list to those
who are real prospects.  So by the time they get to me, the selection
is already very solid.  When Tracy walked in, we instantly felt, "Okay,
this is the character."  One other person came in and was also the
character, with a somewhat different take.  So we brought both of them
back and had them audition one after the other, so we could compare and
see which worked best for the character.  It was Tracy, hands down.

       The casting process was no different for this character as any
other. We knew within moments.

                                                                  jms

Subject: Lochley=Tracy Scoggins!

{original post unavailable}

       No, you don't seem to understand the point.  Of course the
actors you cast have technique.  Where did you get this from? 
Especially the "some actors are just being themselves" part in this
context.  Wortham wasn't "just being himself" as Cartagia, nobody is. 
Neither is Andreas, and neither is Scoggins.  She didn't just walk into
the room and do herself, she created a character.  Lochley is nothing
like Scoggins.  Scoggins made a number of actor's choices, and when she
entered the room, she *was* Lochley.

       I don't mean to be rude, but it's hard to have this
conversation when it's clear you don't really know what's involved in
casting or acting or creating a character, and are using your
misunderstandings to justify ragging on Scoggins.  Andreas was
neck-and-neck with Morgan Shepard for the role of 
G'Kar...fundamentally, Andreas' approach was more in line with what I 
envisioned.  Tracy was the same way.  We cast the person who was right
for the role.  If the person's not right, we don't cast them.  The only
time it hasn't worked out as well as I'd've liked was when we cast Mary
Kay Adams, who was very strong in the auditions, and then made an
actor's choice to play the character very quiet, to not push against
Andreas...but you fade into the woodwork if you do that.  So it's not a
question of technique there, but of choice.  She was right in the
audition, but her choice later wasn't what we'd initially hoped for.

       And Tracy is *great* as Lochley in all the dailies.

       But basically, this is a stupid conversation.  You're obviously
hoping to get me to be defensive about her, and there's no need.  Every
sesaon the same thing happens, a cast member comes in or goes out, or
there is another change, and some people cry that the sky is
falling...and in the end, the choices have been right.  There is
nothing to defend.  Either the work succeeds, or it does not.  And that
will be borne out in the episode, not the talking.  I had to deal with
this with Bruce, Stephen, even Claudia, I would point out, from the
Takashima fans out there, which a lot of folks have conveniently
forgotten.  Lots of folks online were saying that Tamlyn was a strong
female character and that in casting Claudia we were just putting in a 
"babe," and pilloried me for it, and at the end of the day, when they
actually *saw* what she was doing, they were fine with it.

       So I'm kinda tired of playing that game.

       See what she does first, *then* we'll talk.

                                                                  jms

       No, frankly, I don't think Paramount cares about the Hugo, or
even knows what it represents.  I don't believe (though I could be
wrong) that they even *had* anyone at the Hugos in case they'd won. 
No, Paramount's concern is that the franchise shows are losing ratings,
and they're doing everything they can to bolster them and make them
more exciting.

"Maybe I am naive to say that I don't think that you are 100% in
charge of your destiny on the show, naive to say that there are outside
presures that effect some of the decisions you have to make, and naive
to say that budget and time contraints effect who you cast or when you
cast them."

      Okay, you're naive.

"Maybe I just don't understand."

      A distinct possibility.

"If I am naive, then when it comes down to it,everything that is less
than brilliant on the show is your responsibility:  everything."

      I'll accept that only if by the same token I am responsible for
everything that is *more* than brilliant on the show.  Otherwise it's
lopsided.  And both statements are inaccurate.  If an actor blows a
line on the set, if a director doesn't get his coverage, if a prop
breaks seconds before it was supposed to be used, if a lens doesn't
show up from Panavision in time for a particular shot...no, I'm not
responsible for those things.

      For those things that are done deliberately, by choice, by me,
on the show, I will take full responsibility, whether they work or not,
except insofar as that may result in stealing thunder from any of our
actors or crew, in which case the good stuff was their responsibility.

"But then maybe you do think the show is perfect, that when you say
that there is still room for improvement you don't really mean it..."

      Nope.  That I think your statement is flawed does not mean that
I think my show is not flawed.  Two vastly different issues.  If it
were perfect, I would not be struggling every year to make the show
better than the previous year.  We learn by doing.

      As you just did.

> YOU wrote for The Real Ghostbusters?

      Wrote for it, heck, I story edited the first network season and
the syndicated season *simultaneously*, for a total of 78 episodes, and
wrote 22 episodes (5 of which came after that first season) including
the Halloween ABC special for which I wrote a couple of songs.  It was
a great deal of fun to work on, until they messed up Janine, which is
why I left.  Later, when they realized that had been an error, they
asked me to write some more with her pretty much as she had been, and
then to fix the continuity error in an episode called "Janine, You've
Changed."

      Some of the ones I wrote were Xmas Marks the Spot, Mr. Sandman
Dream Me a Dream, Citizen Ghost, Ragnarok and Roll, The Thing in Mrs.
Faversham's Attic, No One Comes to Lupusville, Chicken He Clucked,
Doctor Doctor, and a bunch of others.

      TRGBs is now playing on syndication again, in the Amazing
Adventures package...uncut, as far as I can tell.  (I think it airs
Sundays at 2:30 here in LA.)  It was a hoot, and it's one of the things
I'm still very proud of.

      The stuff Ivanova would've done this season will be shifted in
part to another, but not Lochley.

      Re: Wolf...no, I won't be doing any further Wolfs due to my
ongoing concerns with the way they are being run, the way that the fans
are being treated, the unreasonable lines, and other genuine concerns I
have with Brian and the organization.  They promised that all illegal
good would be kept out; the dealer's room was *chockablock* with
unlicensed, pirated stuff, forcing me to have to go and police the
thing, which was not what I was there for, and put me in some difficult
situations...they promised that the lines would be dealt with fairly,
and they were not...I had yelled before at Brian for showing 4th season
material, as yet unaired in the UK, at conventions, he said he would
not do so, and yet the music videos were full of this footage (he says
he only promised not to show full episodes, so that isn't the same
thing, which is nonsense...he says that he got the videos from others
so they're not his fault, which is also nonsense)...I have asked him,
repeatedly, to follow through on his offer to let us inspect the
records of the charitable donations made by the convention, because I
have heard that a goodly amount the money never reached its proper
destination, and I would like to know the facts one way or the other,
but thus far he has consistently refused to do so, even after having
said at first that they were available for inspection...I've heard
enough times that he has been muscling other conventions by telling 
people he has a lock on our cast that I'm concerned... and so on.

      I have an obligation to associate myself and this program only
where I feel things are being done properly.  My concern here is that
they are not, and thus I cannot and will not involve myself or
Babylonian Productions with any further Wolf conventions.  My cast are
free agents, and can do what they wish, but there will be no further
cooperation with Babylonian Productions until these areas are addressed
and fixed.

{original post had no questions}

      Del Rey has signed a deal with WB to do the B5 novels
henceforth, and as part of that will be doing a series of three, 3-book
arcs (for a total of 9 in addition to stand-alone B5 novels) which will
feature an overall story that I'll assign to the writers involved.  The
goal is to keep them within canon, but allow the writers some degree of
freedom, and to fill in some of the corners in the B5 universe.  For
instance, one 3-book arc may be the story of the fall of Centauri
Prime; another might be the history of the Psi Corps and what made
Bester what he is; and the third set strongly on the B5 station itself.

      These stories are still being determined, natch, so this ain't
final.

       The funny thing is, you usually know within, oh, 25-30 seconds
of the actor actually starting the audition if this is the wrong person
or not. And in that same amount of time, someone else can either nail
it completely, or end up on the short-list for callbacks.  It's totally

"Can the producers of shows run fan events as well?"

      No, nor was that the intent of my message.  We've talked about
doing just one, a one-off convention, here in LA at some point in the
future, but that's all, we can't and wouldn't want to get beyond that. 
No, my only point was that maybe something can be done to make the
profit conventions hew more closely to the rules by which the fan run
conventions operate, and perhaps we can try to influence that in
future.

is not the issue, the quality of approach is what matters.

"What does concern me is the future of the fan convention which, I

      That's definitely, 100% incorrect.  The professional conventions
are only a very small percentage of the overall conventions that take
place in the US.  Most are local, fan-run conventions, and a large

states.

{original post had no questions}

      Thanks.  My main concern at these things is always with the
fans.  My belief is that these people came a long way, and paid a fair
amount of money, and they deserve to get what they paid for with the
least amount of inconvenience.  I tend to be very hands-on when my name
is attached to ANY convention.  At my first Wolf, for instance, I made
it a point to check out the area where we'd be doing our main
presentations the night before, and found that a number of the chairs
had been set up behind pillers and supports so that their view would
be, essentially, blocked.  When I talked to one of the people doing the
arranging, and was told that no, that was the way it had to be ("that's
why we've got some monitors back there, so they can watch it on 
TeeVee," I was told, which was a completely unacceptable response), I
(and Kathryn) got in there and personally began rearranging the chairs,
spending a fair amount of time doing so until we found a configuration
that would let people see the stage.  (We drew quite a few startled
glances from some fans who happened to wander in at one point.)

      Having been (and still being) a fan for most of my life, I can't
condone anything which, in my view, ends up with the fans getting
shafted. If that means being a pain in the ass on occasion, them's the
breaks.  But I'd rather do that than something that violated my
conscience.

                                                                  jms

      Yeah, Pat and Bill are, I think, our only cast members who had
any real convention experience prior to B5, which is why I've taken
pains to try and help them understand the whole fan scene...which is
where the "nobody gets cut off the autograph line" notion came from,
for instance.  By helping them understand the venue, they're more
comfortable with it, and thus spend time not just hiding in their rooms
as is often the case with other shows, but instead go down to the bar,
the lounge, the room parties, and hang out with the fans.  (The tales
of Richard Biggs dancing on tables at Marcon, Bill Mumy at the parties
in the UK, others...they go on and on.)

"And as for B5 being the number one Sci-Fi show, does it really come
any close to the worldwide popularity of The X Files?"

      Oddly enough, the show tends to do much better overseas than it
does here.  Well, not oddly, actually, since overseas it tends to end
up on actual networks, which give it a regular time period, whereas
here you have to have a hunting dog and a Ouija board to find the
darned thing.  The videotapes are invariably in the top-10
sell-throughs overseas, in fan polls it comes out ahead of X-Files
(having just won the SFX Magazine poll for best SF series of all time),
and the ratings are comparable.  If anything, X-Files has gotten a bit
soft lately, while B5 has been improving.  Most of the B5 licensing to 
date has been overseas, with a huge line of books in the UK, along
with a monthly magazine.

      That's expected to change when the show hits TNT, with a regular
schedule, starting in January.

Subject: When TNT reruns...

{original post unavailable}

      That's an interesting question.  When I sat down to write In the
Beginning, my feeling was that I should look at the long term.  Would
the hole in Sinclair's mind be the same mystery it was in season one,
or would it be kind of known thereafter?  If so, then do you want to
play with the mystery, or set up what actually happened?  I figured,
okay, let's go for the latter...let's let the audience know (which will
mostly know by now anyway), and set up the background, with the
characters not knowing the first season. I took basic greek tragedy as
my model, with ItB functioning more or less as a Greek chorus that sets
things up.

      If you want to play it as a strict mystery, then no, probably
don't go near ItB...but frankly, if I were going to start someone off
on B5, I'd definitely want to start with ItB, which sort of skims in
and out of the overall storyline in a beautiful fashion.

                                                                  jms

Subject: Lyta inconsistency

{original post unavailable}

      Yes, it's an inconsistency; because humans are inconsistent. 
But it's only an inconsistency subject to Lyta's
rationalizations...which are quite reasonable.

      She didn't know the Centauri; she knew Garibaldi...they knew
beyond a shadow of a doubt that Brother Edward's *life* was in
jeapordy, and that this person may hold the key to saving his life and
every instant they waited meant he could be dying, whereas there is no
such crisis in the Garibaldi situation...they were able to hide her
identity from the Centauri whereas they would not be able to do so with
her and Garibaldi....

      The decision to scan or not to scan is essentially a moral or
ethical decision.  When someone's life is on the line, that raises one
ethical concern, as opposed to Zack just having a vague suspicion about
Garibaldi's character and asking her to engage in a fishing expedition.
There is a quantum difference between the two of them.

      Would a physician give someone the tools necessary to end his
life? No. Would he do so if the person were chronically ill and in
constant, terrible pain?  Very possibly.  It's the *context*.  You
can't expect people to act the same in every situation regardless of
context, context is everything.

      People are not robots, they rationalize, they are inconsistent,
but they generally have *reasons* for it that they can justify.  As
somebody once said, rationalizations are more important than sex,
because you can *go* a day without sex....

{original post had no questions}

      You keep saying proof, but what sort of proof do you require? 
The fact is that you say "proof" in such a way that no such proof can
be supplied outside of a courtroom.  What constitutes proof?  If you've
said this is what you want, then you must now define it otherwise it's
unfair.  And it has to be reasonable proof...bearing in mind that there
are no smoking guns, no videotapes, no bloody gloves here.

      What can be suggested, in the case of B5, is to provide certain
facts, which are next door neighbors to truth.  It is a *fact* that
Paramount was given the B5 bible, treatment, sample screenplay, and
artwork.  This is not open to dispute; we have the paperwork from the
Paramount development execs.

      It is a *fact* that Paramount and WB were both trying to launch
networks at the same time, UPN and PTEN, and that there is a *fierce*
competition between them that has been well and widely documented,
enough so that Paramount would have a vested interest in attempting to
co-opt anything that Warner Bros. was doing.  One way to do this (enter
supposition stage left) would be to put out their *own* space station
series, under the ST banner, which would hopefully undercut the other
show and drive it (and PTEN) out of the marketplace.

      It is a *fact* that the development of ANY TV show for a studio
is guided by that studio's development execs.

      It is a *fact* that the two pilots for DS9 and B5 are extremely
similar on major, non-generic points.  It is also a fact that the two
diverge quite a bit therafter, showing that the writers there were
capable of doing their own stuff, putting us back again at the studio
level.

      It is a *fact* that I have never, at any time, implied, stated
or said that either of the individuals who created DS9 had ever seen
the B5 material, or consciously took it.  I think that if asked to do
so, they would have declined.  What I have always questioned, or
strongly suspected, was the degree to which the development or
inception of that show was guided by the Paramount development execs. 
So I have NOT accused either of them of "ripping off" B5, and thus
don't fall prey to your accusation of being unfair, whereas Joel's
comment about Mindwar *was* a statement about a story being ripped
off, hence my reaction.  There is not a contradiction there.

     From day one, Paramount has done everything conceivable to
subvert, sabotage, and drive this show out of the market short of
firing a LAWS rocket into the middle of stage A.  They hate us over
there, because they want to have the exclusive lock on space SF.  So
yeah, I'm quite willing to believe that they could've decided to co-opt
our format...and it almost worked, too, when WB wondered if the market
could sustain two space station series, and we came within an inch of
losing the show before we'd even shot a frame of film...but I've never
accused either of the two folks who created DS9 of deliberately ripping
us off because I don't believe they did so.  I have no reason to
believe they are anything other than honorable, stand-up men.  My area
of concern has always been in the area of corporate influence and
intent.

                                                                  jms

       They targeted visually, it was close enough to do so.

       A hit with full guns of a major destroyer and accompanying
ships will kill damn near any single ship that does not have some kind
of defensive screen going (fighers or counter-lasers or missiles or the
like).

       The fightes wer launched in main while on approach.

       Franklin and Marcus *were* strapped in, which if you look more
closely you can see.

 Ron Chusid <74756.3150@compuserve.com> asks:
> Do you think Paramount's development of DS9, as opposed to airing

      Well, I have a piece of the net of B5, which means that there
will never BE any profits to me from the show itself, except the
standard writers guild residuals and a little merchandising.  (In TV
and often movies, the studios make sure that, on paper at least, no
show EVER shows a profit, so they never need to pay out anything.)

      The two shows being side by side didn't help us, I think, only
hurt us. Yes, there was some press about two such shows at the same
time, but it's kind of like having lots of articles about how you were
partially eaten by a shark...all things considered, you'd rather have
avoided the situation in the first place.  It hurt us because they
rushed their show out onto the air first, so that a lot of people
assumed *we* were copying *them* when in fact we'd been around for five
years preceding, trying to sell the show.  It hurt us because some
stations felt they had to choose between us, and there were a number of
reporters who came to us with stories of stations being told by 
Paramount that they had to choose between B5 and DS9, advertisers
being told that our show was going to be crappy with lousy EFX and that
they shouldn't buy commercials on our show, editors being told that if
they covered B5 that DS9 interviews would be withheld...the first two
years were just nonstop trench warfare by Paramount, which seemed
determined to drive us into the sea so that they'd have a monopoly on
this area.  Finally, by year three, they seemed to grudgingly accept
that we were here, and we weren't going anywhere.

      One producer working on another SF project with Paramount called
John Copeland after a meeting with one of the top execs at the studio,
to relay what happened when -- after having some problems with the EFX
on the project they were working on -- he suggested maybe using the
same EFX company that B5 used.  The exec reportedly went on a five
minute rampage about B5, quite profane, saying "It took us 25 years to
build up this franchise, and those (expletives deleted) are screwing it
up!  Nobody who works on that show will EVER work for Paramount."

      So yeah, it's been tough...at the corporate level, even though I
know a number of people who are associated with both ST shows on a
creative level, and we get along fine.  All the problems have emanated
from the corporate brass, not the creative people.  We were at ground
zero for a long, long time...but we're still here, in spite of it all.

                                                                  jms

       "She claims there was no offer for 18 episodes made to her."

       That's correct, and not correct.  What was relayed to her was
that if she wanted to be in just 18, and wanted to be paid for just
those 18, then that was fine...her people insisted that she be paid for
the rest of the episodes, constituting a per-episode pay increase,
which couldn't be done without violating the contracts of all the other
cast.

      Just to let you know...I haven't been online at all in the last
2 days, and may not be on for a bit over the next day or so, or at most
sporadically. I threw my back out badly last Sunday, and didn't know
how much damage I'd done until it reached the point of nearly
incapacitating me by Wednesday.  So what little time I can put in
behind the keyboard over the next few days, until the medication can do
its job, will mainly be spent on writing episodes. It's just a muscle
thing (fortunately) and I have all the right drugs I need, so it's
simply a matter of time and healing.

      What apparently complicated matters was that it happened about
90 minutes before I was scheduled to do my second presentation at a
convention in Tulsa (I slipped in the shower) and refused to cancel the
presentation or the 90 minute autograph session following, knowing that
some folks had come as far as 5 hours drive-time to be there.  Ah,
well...live and learn.

                                                                  jms

and told her that unless we got a yes or no by the next day, after all

WB would be withdrawn.

"Yeah, I've been waiting for the 'you're just a trekkie with nothing

comments. But as you said, Martin did outline his points quite nicely!"

      So in other words, you object to the sort of person who
uncritically goes after someone for giving a negative opinion.

      Okay, that's fair.

      I would also point out, however, that in all the time I have
seen your posts here, it seems like the only time you come out of the
woodwork is to uncritically support someone who says somethilng
negative about the show. Doesn't matter if they say it's too fast, or
too slow...you're right up there the instant it's posted cheering it
on.  Not the positive reactions, ONLY the negative ones, insofar as I
have ever seen, and on every possible issue.

"Because I believe first in foremost in the right of everyone's

      I disagree.  It is the right of everyone's *informed* opinion. 
If someone were to come in here saying that all (pick an ethnic group)
were slovenly, lazy and genetically inferior to (pick an ethnic group),
I suggest that you would object, because it's bigotry and not an
informed opinion.

      The B5 forum has its share of strafers...people who buzz in,
drop an inflammatory message, and zoom back out again, letting the
bombs crash and the arguments that follow...and have no interest in any
kind of discussion. Often they never even come back, as was the case
with the person who said the show was boring.  I notice that none of
the replies to his messages had the (X) that says it was received by
him.

      So the quote above is untrue on the face of it.  Also, it does
sound as if you're saying it's good to be negative, but to be negative
*about* the negative statement, that needs to be fought back
uncritically, regardless of the validity of the original statement. 
The result is that you sign a blank check on your conscience and
credibility.
