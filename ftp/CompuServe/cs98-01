      Yes, the Gathering will be aired after In the Beginning.  I
think they'll run the Guide again in-between, though.

      I'll deal with the new fans as I have with the old timers...with
as much courtesy as I can, because I owe them no less.  One thing that
*would* help is if people continue what they've been doing, and if a
question comes up where the answer is known, or the questioner can be
pointed to a faq, if they can continue to dive in and point the person
to the relevant info, thus saving me the effort, that would be
wonderful as well.

      I saw some of it, was working most of the time.  They did shoot
a few select shows on videotape, as an experiment, which they later
dropped.

      That's a good question, and one of the things I'd like to do
(but which I can't see any way to do in the series) is the whole story
of who Kosh was, how he got to be who and what he was, why he felt the
way he did toward humans (part of it was knowing Valen)...maybe this
will have to go into one of the novels.

      I don't think I've much noticed or cared what sections there
were, or how many there were.  I just mainly look at what messages come
to me directly, and what new ones there are, using Tapcis...there could
be 50 sections or 5, the number of questions tends to remain the same.

      It made more sense to put it in line with the series, since
there's 22 of the first season, and only 1 of the pilot.

"Far better than many of the "blockbuster" films that appeared  in the

million for one movie?"

      I don't know offhand, but for that kind of money you should
expect at least a 50% cardiac arrest scenario....

      That Kosh, always a mumbler.

"Londo said "...look what _we_ did to _ourselves_...." when he looked
out the window.  So, does this mean the shadow-helpers didn't actually
do the destruction?  Perhaps the Centauri did it trying to drive them
out?"

      You'll get the answer to that one soon enough.

      Yeah, in my notes on Sheridan I had him meeting Sheridan before,
but never did much with it at the time...we never see the first time
Sheridan and Franklin meet in the second season, and when we do they're
hanging out pretty casually, as people who've met each other before
might.  Bear in mind, also, that there's about 11 years between the two
incidents, and at best they were casual acquaintances on one mission.

                                                                  jms

      Thanks....

"I know you probably couldn't have made a movie about the
Earth-Minbari War without giving away the ending, but I was kind of
hoping the details would be left more vague than they were for the
benefit of new viewers."

      I came to that part of my decision-making process, and realized
that in 2, 5 or 10 years, the secret ain't gonna be secret anymore...so
why not play into that, and make the audience aware up front, which
adds a different kind of tension, like seeing the bomb under the table
when the characters eating dinner don't know it's there.

      We got the ratings, and I can't release them yet, that has to
come from TNT, but suffice to say they're dancing in the aisles over at
TNT.  Again, I can't give specifics yet, but they had a very specific
rating in mind that they felt was the best we would probaby get, which
we beat handily, and they felt that the pilot, being a rerun, wouldn't
do that well...and it ended up doing as well as the maximum they'd
hoped the prequel would get.

      They're stunned.

"I nearly cried when the President asked the military to "hold the
line" so that a pitiful few hundred could escape. In that single
moment, you feel that even if the Minbari had done it, those few
refugees would have sired a people who, eventually, would have made it.
Just at that moment, you see the echo to the ball of light flying into
the encounter suit a million years hence."

      It's a very moving scene, even for me.  There's something in
particular about a female president making that request, and giving
those orders, that is especially strong.  I don't know why that should
be, but somehow it is. We as a people tend to forget our own strength,
and as Londo says, our stubborn nobility.  We only seem to remember it
when we stand on the edge of the abyss, when it's almost too late to do
anything about it.

"I always have felt this show is about him."

      Yeah, in many ways, it is.

"Also, the reworking of Sinclair's narration of the Battle of the
Line, with Requiem for the Line and the battle transmissions was just
gripping, it really showcased Michael O'Hare's strengths as an actor."

      Yeah, that was an experiment I wanted to try.  When we did the
audio spotting (me sitting with the sound folks, Chris, others), I
explained what I wanted done with that scene, and they kinda got it but
were a little dubious as to whether or not this could or would work. 
When we came to the day of the audio mix, it was kind of a jumble...so
I worked with the music and the voices to basically fill in the gaps
between Sinclair's words.  Then I backed up and chose the ones that
most related to what he had just said, or was about to just say.  It
took about half an hour to get that 30 second piece down pat.

      One of the least visible things I do is mess with the music and
how the music lays out on the track.  I'm often at the front of the
mixing room, working with the mixers, bringing up one instrument
(percussion, for instance), bringing down the horns for one piece, up
in another.  In "In the Beginning," for instance, there was percussion
all through the Battle of the Line itself...and we had big EFX of guns
and explosions going off, and the two muddied together.  So I went with
the explosions for the first of it, then replaced some of the
gunfire/explosions with percussion, then ducked down the SFX altogether
and just let the music take it.  You kind of have to be a conductor in
these instances.

      (Which is why the astute will notice a slight change in the main
title music starting with 507.  I was down sick when they had to do the
main title mix, and couldn't get into it.  When we had to modify some
voice stuff for 507, I went in and pulled out all the music stems and
rebalanced stuff to bring out the themes more, which kind of got buried
a little in places.  All the same individual pieces are there, but in
different perspectives.

                                                                  jms

      Zha is the usual reference for the future, whose meaning changes
depending on whether it's a suffix or a prefix, and what it's up
against. Isil-zha usually means change, changing the future, coming of
a new age; entil-zha is the one who creates or guides the forces
creating the future; and z'ha'dum (with the broken zha) is the death of
the future, or the dark future.

      And yes, Kosh and Ulkesh were contemporaries, though Ulkesh was
the more military of the two, very isolationist, while Kosh was the
curious one, interested in the younger races, and more willing to
extend himself (with sometimes unfortunate results).  Kosh always
worried what Ulkesh would do without his moderating presence...and
ultimately had to be the one to take him down to allow the younger
races to step forward.

      You're right, as far as it goes...I think Kosh came late to the
table. I don't think he came to B5 with that intent, but it grew in him
over time that this cycle had to end, and he could be instrumental to
that.

"Did you consider putting the scene of the hunter confronting the
Minbari at the battle of the line into the movie?"

      Yeah, for some time, in fact...but the logistics involved in
staging a full-scale assault, dozens of soul hunters, the fight itself,
would've taken up about 10-15 minutes minimum, which would have had to
come out elsewhere, and I can't find 15 minutes in that movie that's
expendable.  One can only do so much in the amout of space, and time,
and money, one has.

"One is a picture of what appears to be a soul hunter craft crashed

      No, there wasn't time to do it in the movie...it would've taken
about 10-15 minutes to set it up and pay it off properly, and I
couldn't find 15 expendable minutes in ItB.  There's a brief window
after the body's death where the soul hunters can still move in, so
there was time...we showed their ships moving in in Atonement, and to
do so again here would get in the way and really confuse new viewers.

      Why call the United States a democracy when it's a republic?

      You must understand that there is always some difference between
what a country calls itself, and what it actually is...further, though
the Centauri Republic may have been more of a republic than it is now,
it almost certainly wouldn't change thousands of years of history books
just to accommodate a slight shift in direction.  No matter what form
its government takes, it will always call itself the Centauri Republic,
because that's their whole identity, their history.  We lie to
ourselves all the time...that's what most governments are built on.

      TNT did some market research prior to the launch of B5, and the
two questions they wanted answered were, what does a new viewer need to
tune in to B5, and what do the current viewers need to bring them in to
watch again?

      The research told them all the things they had to include, and
do, and say, to get the new viewers...and then when they got to what
the current viewers need:

      "They just need to know when it's on."

      I think that's when they began to sense something rather massive

Subject: Be These Truly Reruns?

{original post had no questions}

"Very occasionally one catches a nuance that was  missed on the first
go-round.  But with the B5 reruns it's an entirely new experience,
because one doesn't catch a mere nuance, but entire leitmotifs that may
have been originally delineated, but are only fully visible in
retrospect. The best of TV or movies have a 3-dimensional feel from the
depth of the characters moving in an engrossing plot....B5 more and
more feels like a flamin' tesseract!  It is truly amazing to sense the
layers from later episodes blooming from incidents and statements in
early episodes like a Web-page with all of the hyperlinks "active"
simultaneously."

      And lemme tell you something...this has been INCREDIBLY hard to
pull off.  If I'd known just how hard, I don't know if I would've tried
to tackle it.  The only reason this got done was that I didn't know it
couldn't be done until I'd already done it.

      One of the hard things was putting this stuff in, and having a
number of folks at the beginning say, "Where's the story?  Where's this
so-called arc? It's nothing."  I knew it was there, and knew that
they'd know it was there...but like life, we don't see the patterns
until afterward.  That was a real risk.  But I always wanted to plan
this story for the long-haul, timing it and measuring it out with the
knowledge that -- though it ran on a weird schedule for each of its
original years -- in the long run it would show every day for years. 
So it had to serve two masters, the short term goal and the long-term
one.

      It's what I promised when I talked about holographic
storytelling 4 years ago...the more you see, the more you can see
*through* the layers to the patterns they form, one behind the next. 
It's not a form that's really been done much before, so I kinda had to
find ways to make it work on the fly.  You have to have a mind like a
rabbit warren to keep all the pieces together, running simultaneously,
to write this stuff.

      What's been rewarding is seeing so many people now coming
forward to say much the same thing as you just said.  It means I did it
right.  I gambled on the intelligence of viewers, and that gamble has
paid off.

      All of which is one big reason why I'm going to be glad to be
finished with B5, as much as I'm going to miss it.  It's been a hideous
struggle to get all this down on paper, and to stay ahead of the
Machine, the camera, which chews through stories at the rate of 24
frames per second.  In a way, now I kinda know what John Henry felt
like, going up against the steam engine.  Just a few more steps, and
I'll have beaten the damned thing.

                                                                  jms

"At the end of A Sky Full of Stars which aired tonight, a Minbari
tells Delenn Sinclair must be killed if he remembers the encounter. 
One of my friends considers this the greatest gaffe in the series."

      Here's the reasoning on this.

      First, understand that Minbari believe in reincarnation.

      Second, as noted in ItB, if the Sinclair/Valen/soul issue got
out, it would likely tear Minbari society apart.  The repercussions
would be devastating on every possible level, if it came before they
could be prepared properly.

      In light of that, with or without a Minbari (or Valen's) soul,
better to sacrifice Sinclair (who will be reborn anyway, and maybe next
time in a proper Minbari body) than see Minbar damaged.  Remember, they
don't know about the time loop, they see it as a straight-line
progression.

      Thanks...yeah, this in some ways is my favorite title sequence. 
It took a long time to make it, and it was very difficult to assemble. 
Usually I can design the title sequence on paper, and the working with
the editors part doesn't take that long...here it took a Long Time to
painstakingly choose the images, use counterpoint dialogue, pick the
high moments and make it all flow from one year to the next, sort of a
Cliff's Notes version of the history of the show.  And the music is
terrific...very mature, solid sounding.

      Shouldn't really make any difference...you can close 'em if you

      Revell did a good job and they were very patient...we kept
coming back to them with corrections, and even when they didn't have to
do them, as the deadline came up, they made the changes anyway.  I

{original post had no questions}

      Thanks...in about two dozen comments so far about the S5 title,
only one has been negative, the rest loving it.  It helps to place each
season for the new viewers, recaps things, hits the high points, and
the new music gives it a more mature sound.  I'm pleased.  (Since I
designed it, I guess I'd better be....)

      It's a mix-and-match world this season, showing the disparate
parts of the B5 world after the various worlds as they have kind of
blown apart, as they gradually come back together again.

      Except, of course, that the Clark aspect is mentioned several
times over the course of season 5.

      Basically, it seems to me a tad over the top to expect that the
new season 5 episodes should not contain information that's a spoiler
for 1-4; you may as well not MAKE the show on that basis.  If you're
going to tune in to S5 after not seeing 1-4, you're going to learn
things you didn't know; that can't be helped, and I can't see the
wisdom in hobbling the show for all the rest of the years to come to
protect a few newbies in the current season who, if they're THAT
concerned about being spoiled, shouldn't be watching.

      This seems to me at times a bit like the v-chip discussion...do
we have to protect everybody all the time and let them never assume any
kind of responsibility for their own actions?  Seems that deprives them
of free will and free choice, all in the name of "protecting" them.

      I picked TV because this sort of saga has been *done* for print
before, but nobody's done it for TV in the US before.  It's more of a
challenge to do it here.

                                                                  jms

      No, this season you get 22 episodes, no extras in the series.

      Re: the schedule...it was brought to our attention that the NBA
coverage would lead to episodes being shunted around and pre-empted for
a number of weeks.  Obviously this concerned us, and would concern
viewers, so we discussed it with TNT, and they came back to us with the
notion that we would continue new episodes until hitting #100, break
for the NBA games, then come back (starting with another possible
half-hour special) afterward at the same time to finish the season.

      It was either this, or get shuffled around the schedule due to
the NBA, and the former is infinitely preferable.

                                                                  jms

      Thing is, I think we're taking the term "spoilers" and taking it
to a new level of definition that simply isn't valid.  A spoiler means
getting information on an episode that hasn't aired yet in one's area,
it doesn't refer to things that a) have happened long ago, or b) one
may not have seen the first time it aired.  I just don't think it's a
valid approach on the face of it.

      This came out of discussions with TNT when it came out that we
would have to be pre-empted and shuffled around for the NBA playoffs. 
It made more sense to let them go through unobstructed, then come back
afterward in the same slot rather than forcing fans to go hunting
again.  It's not a big.

      Certainly, it's our intent to keep the production team together
on Crusade, once that gets going...if I sold any other shows, we've
discussed the possibility of splitting the team in half, bringing in
some new guys on the current show (whichever that is), and putting half
our current team on the new show, so that both can learn from one
another....

      But in terms of doing other writers' shows...that's not
something I'm interested in doing.  It's just too damned hard to do all
this for someone else's story.  I don't want to be the exec supervising
somebody else's show; that would turn me into a Suit, and that would be
the end of me.

      NDEI, as a separate entity, is better able to handle some of
this sort of thing, but I'm not directly involved with any of that.  I
know they've got another project of their own that's nearly solid now,
called Rail Runners (steampunk SF), and I'm confident that they will
use the lessons we've learned on B5 in doing that show, or any others
down the road.

      We're having an effect on TV more by osmosis than by making it
ourselves in terms of doing other shows...the term 5-year arc is
showing up more and more, first in Dark Skies then Earth: Final
Conflict, and now others in the works...the CGI we pioneered for TV is
now showing up in a lot of other series...and other shows are studying
our methods.  The Directors Guild magazine has already done one major
article on some new things we're doing, and another one is due out
soon.  We've given tours to other producers to show them how we do what
we do.  And our directors, some of whom were fairly new to dramatic TV
(having done documentaries and afternoon specials and the like) before
coming to B5 have now become in demand on other shows (you'll note
that a lot of B5 directors are now doing ST shows because they've
learned our methods...which is kinda ironic since no ST directors have
done B5 because of studio pressure not to)....

      So the impact is already there, and will continue to grow over
the coming years.

                                                                  jms

      I always find remarks like yours amusing...since the Star Trek
shows are currently using the same systems, CGI, and in many cases, the
same animators who worked on the first 3 years of B5 via the same
company that we helped to set in place, Foundation Imaging.

      The difference is not in the perceived, but in the perceiver.

"In the "2 years" montage in "In The Beginning", we see an Earth

its middle. Does this mean that Sheridan's was not the only ship that
destroyed a Minbari battleship during the war?"

      Sheridan was the only one to score a *victory* against a Minbari
war cruiser.  Meaning he survived.  Ramming one, and dying in the
process, ain't a victory...at best it's a draw.

      I don't think any characterization of the Narns as simply

free of Centauri oppression, turned around and were in the process of
doing to others what had been done to them.  They did a lot of awful
things, no mistake.

      Jerry has been shaving his head, getting shorter each year, and
it worked for where his character is going, so I let it stay...Bruce
would love nothing more than to get rid of the beard (I suspect Melissa
doesn't like it also), but for me it's important to make the character
visually different, and to give him a more mature look, so Bruce
graciously indulges me.

      Re: the novels...in the first few, the writers came up with
outlines and then manuscripts which they ran past me.  I subsequently
decided that this didn't work because too many non-canonical things
were slipping in, and if I was reading the ms. late at night I'd miss
things, and generally they didn't feel like the show.  The last few
from Dell, and the new ones from Del Rey, will proceed from outlines
assigned out from my office, based on my notes about the B5 universe.

      You're correct; we always start out slow each
season...especially in this case, knowing that we're going to get a lot
of new viewers, I structured the show so it would bring folks up to
date asap on who everybody is, and where things stand.  Believe me,
there's plenty of tragedy and pathos lurking right around the corner. 
It picks up at the end of the season, after some very rough things for
the characters, because I can't end it all on a downer, but at the same
time, it has to have meat to it.

"Isn't the Psi Corps still formally a branch of EarthGov? If so, then
wasn't Captain Lochley duty-bound to report Byron's people to the Psi
Cops as soon as she found out that they were rogues?"

      Thanks...it's easy to mistake the actor for the character in
situations like this.

      It's a vastly different character from Ivanova also, not meant
to fit in the same place, do the same things, or be the same person. 
They're both strong characters, but different in their approach. 
Ivanova tended to be a shouter, and on the impatient side...Lochley is
a thinker, and more inclined to the blade than the ball-bat.  But both
are equally lethal.

      Lochley, I think, also has the maturity of character you need to
rise to the rank of captain in the military, and the voice of moral
authority, which both Sinclair and Sheridan had, in comparable
positions.

                                                                  jms

      Oh, she has a sense of humor...but we don't see it here in this
episode any more than when Ivanova first came in, because both are in
new situations and that requires a certain degree of seriousness. 
We'll see some of her humor along the way...it's also different from
Ivanova's, more a sly kind of humor, the sort that slips past you and
ricochets around the corner half an hour later to nail you between the
eyes.

      Just a general FYI...the Fleer S4 card set has just come in, and
should be appearing soon at stores.  They're gorgeous cards, with not
only the pictures on one side, but also on the same side, a line of
dialogue associated with that character that can only be seen if you
tilt the card; plus some nice (but not excessive in number) chase
cards...real nice.

      And the first issue of the DC comic Valen miniseries just got
into my hands; should be hitting stores the coming week or so.

"This was unfair to the B5 brass and said no. CC was in England
promoting the show, the time-limit on the contract signing passed, and
she was fired and replaced."

      Just to clarify...since she had declined to sign the same
extension the rest of the cast signed, she was no longer working for B5
at that time, and hadn't been for over a month.  You can't fire someone
who isn't working for you.  All WB could do was make an offer, which
she could accept or not.

      No, the contact omission was kept because of the story and the

      I think the preview now is actually between acts 3 and 4.

{original post unavailable}

      The real cards have a white area at the bottom for signatures;
none of the other cards have that white area.  If it's anything other,
it's a fake.
