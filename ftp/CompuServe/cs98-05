      The color of the sets varies by location; DownBelow tends to be
more in the red end and brown end of the spectrum (hence the term Brown
Sector that sometimes applies), where most of the command sectors are
blueish.

      No, he wasn't faking it.  Understand that their appearance as a
being of light is only how they want to appear; they are life forms
much the same as many others, and can be poisoned if one knows the
right combination of substances.

> and will you be giving a B5/Crusade presentation?

      At this point, I don't know if I can do SDCC or not this year; I
had to cancel out one convention already around that time, because of
the need to gear up Crusade.  I'd assumed that I wouldn't have anything
going this Summer, so I booked a number of conventions all in the same
two month period of time, kind of a post-B5 blitzkreig.  Then all hell
broke loose.  So I may either not go (first time for that in 12 years)
or just pop down on one day for a quick Dealer's Room run-through and
out.  I can't just go for the one day if I do my full
presentation...I'm too whacked afterward for shopping at the DR, and I 
can do so beforehand because I'm prepping for the presentation.  So
I'm kinda unsure right now what to do, and what I'll have time for.

                                                                  jms

      No, A Call to Arms isn't a Crusade pilot, it's a B5 movie that
somewhat sets the stage for the new show, but is not a part of it.

      Okay, from the beginning of the Claudia Christian departure,
I've been saying that she quit.  At the time, she said she was fired. 
And a lot of people said, "Well, we'll never really know."  This
despite all the basic facts being confirmed by both sides.

      I quote from an interview with Claudia just published in the
Summer issue of Sci Fi Invasion:

      Question: By you quitting, Straczynski lost Ivanova.  He
couldn't have been happy about that.

      Claudia: I think he feels like I put them out or something by
quitting the show, when in essence I don't really think it affected
anything.  (small snip)  I just didn't think there'd be a lot for me to
do, and I didn't want to be relegated to one more year of not having my
any challenges.

      She has finally confirmed it: I told the truth from the
beginning.  She quit.  She wasn't fired.  She quit.

      This debate is now over.

                                                                  jms

      I have commented on them.  Understand that this is an ensemble
show. We have (and have had) anywhere from 11-14 regular/recurring
characters, and it is common for any number of them in a crowd that big
to feel that they are being under-utilized.  I use each of the cast
members as much as the story requires.  That's all I *can* do, because
nothing else makes sense.

                                                                  jms

Subject: WB Home Video Does B5

      Victories come in all sizes; in some ways, this is a small one,
in other ways this is a big one.

      For four years, we bugged Warner Bros. Home Video about
releasing B5 on videocassette in retail outlets.  But WB has never
released a series before on tape, it's not something they *do*, not
sufficiently prestige when compared with their big movies.  Eventually
they were persuaded to let Columbia House try it for mail-order, for
the first season.

      And CH was *swamped* with orders.  Phones rang off the hook, and
tapes were back-ordered to try and fill the demand.

      And Warner Bros...noticed.

      And this month, they made a big announcement about the coming
release of Babylon 5 on video through retail outlets all over the
country.  I've seen the cover designs for the first batch, and they're
extremely good looking montages, each specifically designed for that
tape.  They're putting a lot of thought and effort and time into this,
and a big campaign.  I believe the first batch hits the stands in July
or August, somewhere in there.

      This is a big victory for us.  On a grand scale, it may seem
minor, but it's the most direct statement of "you were right" we've
ever had from WB, and they were sufficiently mensches to say so, and
act on it.

      If these go well, they're also talking laserdisks and DVDs down
the road, and should THAT happen, I'm going to push like hell to have
them release the widescreen versions.

      But that's the next campaign.  For now, this is a big victory
for us, and we're mighty pleased.

                                                                  jms

      No, I don't feel I need to defend it...but a lot of people made
a big deal about who you should believe...and now it's clear what was
going on at the time was what I said it was...and a few folks are
saying, "Well, now it doesn't matter."  Well, it does matter, when it's
my integrity and honesty that's at issue.  If the original question was
worth some folks making a big deal out of it, then getting the facts
straight should merit as much attention.

      TNT has moved up the airdate for "The River of Souls" to
November 8th (from November 22nd) so that a) B5 fans won't have so long
to wait, and b) to make sure both that and Sleeping in Light both get
equal promotion, and one doesn't get lost in the other.

      Also...when the fifth season begins again from "No Compromises"
in the first week of July, it will coincide with the debut of TNT's new
satellite relay which means that the 5th season episodes will air at
the same time on both the East and West coasts (I think 8:00 p.m., I
haven't heard the final on that yet)...AND they're adding a repeat of
each new episode the same night at 11 p.m.

      It's two episodes per tape, and I think it's about $14.95 per

grab these while we can.  (And if they do well, the odds of DVD
increase.)

      No, we can't put the scenes in because it would mean a full
audio remix, which is very expensive.  The director's cut (which is
often extremely changed when John and I go in to do our version, so
you're basically getting the producer's cut from which we then cut
lines and bits) only exists on computer disk, not on film.  We'd have
to go back into the thing and that would take a massive amount of
money.

      It's my understanding that this is one of the things that will
be facilitated by the changeover to HDTV format.  But either way, the
delivery is up to WB, we're just focusing on making it as good as we
can in this respect, so we're ready for whatever comes.

      The funny thing is, the DVDs already cost less than laserdisks,
and will continue to come down, simply because they're smaller and
easier to produce.

      Peace can be a surrender as well as an achievement, especially
when facing an enemy dedicated to something unpleasant.  Chamberlin
returned from a visit to Germany with a so-called agreement in his
hands, and announced that by granting concessions to Hitler, he had
achieved "peace in our time."

      I don't know; I think they had a one-year trial on this thing
for the first season's worth of tapes, and with WB getting into it, I
don't know how this will break out down the road when that trial
expires.

format; same will be the case for Crusade.

      There's really no best regular size.  B5 generally had about 9-
11 regulars and recurring (i.e., in the main credits) actors in any
given season, which was necessary because you had 4 different,
competing forces, each of whom required some representation (Earth/B5,
Minbar, Narn, Centauri Prime). With an ambassador plus aide, that's 8
minimum, plus at least one or two others for station operations.

      In Crusade, we're really dealing with one force encountering
others on a per-episode basis (mostly), so we've got 6 regulars/recurs,
with a subset of reappearing characters (a la Morden, Bester or Corwin
in B5).  That feels about right to me.

                                                                  jms

      What I think they're referring to is the level of detail put
into finishing a set; there are imperfections you'll never see on the
average 27" TV screen that will be huge and obvious on a 35' movie
screen.  So that may be what they mean.  It's common to go for the
former level of detail than the latter on most TV.

      What you are saying is that you want me to help your friend to
find a way around the problem of publishing an unauthorized book that
would not exist were it not for Babylon 5, but for which your friend
does not want to share any of the money or profit for that book with
the studio and entity that created it.  Granted that my portion of any
of this is barely enough to register...nonetheless, he is going to be
basing those trivia questions based on characters, dialogue and
situations that I created...but he does not see any reason why I, as
the person responsible for the material he is going to print, should
benefit from this book.

      If your friend wants to do a B5 trivia book, then I suggest he
take the very simple steps involved in doing so in an authorized, legal
and responsible fashion.

      No, the first episode will be of normal length.  A Call to Arms
is primarily a B5 movie, which sets the incidents in place that lead to
Crusade, which then hits the ground running with its first episode,
regular length, same as the other 21 TNT has signed for.

      Funny thing is...I've written about 200 or so produced episodes

half hours and 120 one-hour shows...that's 160 hours of TV...the

hours a week...so it would fill 8 weeks of prime-time programming on

      It's possible that Bester would appear elsewhere, whether in a
TV movie or elsewhere, maybe even Crusade, we'll have to see.

"Now, was that the animated "Ghostbusters" that aired back in the
eighties? My memories are dim because I was only maybe seven at the
time (showing my youth here) but my brother and I absolutely loved the
animated "Ghostbusters"."

      Yeah, that was my show.  I did the first network season of 13
episodes, and the syndicated season of 65 episodes...of which I wrote
something like 16 or 18 episodes.  Left it when they insisted on
changing Janine into a mommy character and knocked all the edges off
the show.

      Thing was, the show was successful *across the board*...all
ages.  It was ABC's number one rated animated series.  That's when they
came to the "Well, anything can be improved...let's call in some child
psychologists and consultants," which is when the whole thing went to
hell.

      Meaning I know but I ain't telling.

      And I'm 43.

      Funny story there...I had occasion to take a cab recently, and I
get in, and the driver is this Russian guy, medium-accent.  He looks
back, and he says, "I am trying to decide which of us is older, you or
me."  Jokingly, I suggest that it's probably me, and he says, "No, it
is probably me.  I am 52. I am guessing you are...48."

      "Actually, I'm 43," I said.

      "FORTY THREE?!" he says...and damn near drives off the road.

      I shrug.  "I've had a hard life."

      "Must be," he said, shaking his head.

      It would take a hell of a lot more than greying hair and

      And yeah, the show has definitely aged me.  I recently saw a
friend whom I haven't seen face to face since about year 1 of B5, and
the first words out of his mouth were "Jesus Christ what happened to
YOU?"  (Thanks, great to see you, too....)

Subject: Cast Decline Crusade

{original post had no questions}

      To clarify:

      Jerry was never offered a contract on Crusade.  When he
negotiated his deal on "A Call to Arms," WB attempted to get an option
on him for the series, as a matter of due course.  They did so for
everyone appearing in the movie, including Jeff and Tracy, since it is
in many ways a set-up for Crusade.  This is a pro-forma thing done in
such situations by any studio when they're dealing with a new series
being set up.  It doesn't exclude any kind of appearance in Crusade on
a guest basis or more than that.

      Frankly, I think Jerry would do better on a per-episode
negotiation (and would be better featured that way) than to get tied up
with an option. And told him so when he approached me for advice on
whether or not to let himself get saddled with an option.

      The best possible situation would be a central core of new
characters who can move through the B5 universe, and run into our
familiar characters, on an as-needed basis, as determined by the story.
It gives the story maximum flexibility, and lets the actors negotiate
sort of "a la carte," if you will, which means they'll almost certainly
get more than if they get locked down and have to do X-number of
episodes at a pre-negotiated price.

      And that seems to be pretty much what we're heading toward.  In
addition, I think we need to have the B5 cast available for a feature
film that is getting more and more probable by the day.  That, to be
honest, is where they're finally going to make the kind of money
they've all earned by staying with this show for this long.

                                                                  jms

{original post had no questions}

      One last follow-up to underline why I suggested Jerry not go for
the option.  A CONTRACT is a *guarantee* that you will pay X actor Y
dollars to appear in Z episodes.  An OPTION ensure's the studio's
*right* to your services, but does not *guarantee* them.  So you can be
under option, and at the last moment, the studio can decide not to
exercise that option...and you get nothing.

      Why is this important?  Because all of the actors are out now
looking to build on what they've established in their careers over 5
years of B5, with possibilities of leads on other better-paying network
gigs, features, who knows.  But if you go to network A and they want
you, but find out that someone else has an option on you that may
preclude you from working for them, then they're going to find someone
else.

      An option like this ties you down, with the possibility of not
getting any other work, and in the end may not even be exercised. 
Coming hot off the big fifth year promotion, I can see why this might
not be high on someone's list of possibilities.

                                                                  jms
