Subject: UK B5 FAN TO BE SUED!!

{original post had no questions}

      Wearing a beard and glasses is not grounds for any kind of suit,
or I would be in court forever.

      I've been warning people for some time now, particularly those
who abuse the copyright, that WB is cracking down.  Over two dozen
*judgements* have been rendered in cases pursued by WB against pirates
and hackers and others who've imperiled the copyright to B5.  If this
windows "help" file is what I think it is, it's filled with images and
material owned by WB, and is being mass distributed.  Whether for free
or profit isn't the issue, it's the repackaging of material.  The
"bearded/glasses" thing sounds like smoke to me because the person got
caught.

      On the one hand, we've gotten WB to be fairly relaxed about web
sites and fan stuff, as long as the proper copyright info is
appended...but at the same time, they're cracking down on those who are
abusing the situation and unquestionably infringing on WB's copyright. 
(Note to dealers and con organizers: they've been seriously going after
counterfeiters and pirates, and some cons have had to pay the price for
not properly policing their dealer's rooms for counterfeit
merchandise.)  In most cases that I know of, the person is given a
warning first...then hit when and if they choose to get stupid and 
ignore the warning.  I don't know the situation with this one, but I
would guess it's the same.

      WB owns B5, and WB has an obligation to protect it from falling
into public domain, which *will happen* unless it vigorously goes after
parties who infringe on that copyright.  There is no corporation on the
planet that acts otherwise.

                                                                  jms

      Obviously there's a lot of wriggle room here because there's so
much material covered, but at least the sense of it is canonical, and a
lot of what they came up with was sufficiently good that I looked at it

      Actually, Claudia never played Ivanova with a Russian accent.  I
still can't figure out why people keep saying this.  She was very
formal, but there was never, ever any accent unless she was saying a
Russian name, but that's all.

      To anyone one the Psi Phi mailing list or web site: someone has
been logging on to impersonate me over this past weekend.  I have
never, at any time, posted on this site, and any messages are to be
discounted, deleted and ignored.  If anyone knows the sysop of this
system, please notify them and tell them to remove that account.

      There have been, and continue to be, impersonators using my name
on other systems.  If you see something that looks suspicious, or if I
show up on an unfamiliar system, please send email to me asking if it's
actually me or not.  Generally the only places I post *ever* are
Compuserve, GEnie, AOL, the usenet moderated group, and the B5 fan club
site.

      To those considering this prank: understand that whereas other
activities are fuzzy under the law when it comes to the cyberworld,
falsy impersonating someone is *not*, and you will be arrested.  Count
on it.

      Leaving aside the whole broader questions at work here -- and
there are many -- I think that on balance, B5 fans would have a harder
time falling for this sort of thing in general because B5 does not
offer answers, only questions, and encourages viewers to think for
themselves and question authority.  This would not make them good
candidates for cult recruitment drives.

      They would be a *major* disruption in an environment such as B5,
so their presence is discouraged in the sense of having an office
there, though other teeps do pass through on occasion.

      No, I was not told that people had left the line and not been
allowed in.  At one point, a security person pointed to the end of the
line and told me that now that we'd begun that would be the end of it,
but that's all. (And I kept insisting that I'd sign more than one
thing, I'm real fast that way.) I felt that they were a little
ham-handed in this...but at the same time, particulary Sunday, I was on
a *very* tight schedule, and that made things tough for everyone.  But
my policy holds: if someone's in line, they should get an autograph, no
matter how long it takes.

       The song was in the script; Jason then had to learn it.  And
Andreas came in and auditioned like others, and we responded to what we
saw during his audition.  Simple as that.

Subject: jms Note to German Fans

      I spoke to Bruce today, and apparently whatever problems may
have existed have been worked out, and he, Richard Biggs and Jerry
Doyle are now all confirmed for the German convention this summer.

      Now, that stated, an open letter to the German fan groups.

      Many on the B5 staff and I have been inundated with email from
fans in Germany, and organizers of various fan groups, and fan
counter-groups, and counter-counter groups, and insisting -- no,
*demanding* -- that we get personally involved in the fan situation
there, that so-and-so has no business working in X area of fandom, that
this group over here isn't as right or proper as *that* group over
there, insisting again and again that we issue statements condemning or
repudiating one group or another....

      Stop it.

      For starters you're making my people crazy.  And some of the
cast.  You do not endear yourselves with this behavior.

      Second: it is not our place to intervene in fan-vs-fan disputes.
Not only *would* we not do so, it would be wrong for us to try, and it
would be resented by the majority of fans, rightly so.

      Granted that there are always, and will always be, schisms and
politics and back-alley metaphorical knifings between one fan group and
another, that goes with the territory, and it happens in many
countries.  But the ferocity of this competition, and the blizzard of
email to my staffers and others involved with the show from those
involved in the current dispute has gone beyond the pale.

      If I know from personal experience or knowledge that a given
convention is going to be trouble, I'll say so...but I (and we) have no
direct knowledge of the situation in German fandom, and to ask us to
condemn or recognize one faction or another when we are completely in
the dark is simply wrong.

      (I should mention that it's primarily those who are actually
involved in one group or another who are making life difficult for us
here; we have received only wonderful support from German fans in
general, who don't get involved in the politics of local fandom.  We're
very proud of how the show has been received in Germany, and are only
appreciative of the great response and support and letters we've
received.  This is primarily addressed only to the specific groups
involved.)

       Sinclair went back because he would always go back and always
went back; the "alternate" timeline phrase isn't quite correct...it's
more like the moment when the two possible wave forms of
*possibilities* must collapse into one probability or certainty, both
tugging at the same time.  For instance, you've got Shroedinger's cat,
put into a box, with a 50/50 chance of a poison gas capsule opening and
killing the cat.  At the instant before you open the box, Shroedinger
said, the cat is neither dead nor alive, but *both*, until you open the
box and the two possibilities collapse into one. It isn't that the cat
had two alternate timelines, only that there were two possibilities 
fighting it out to become the real one.

       That's my story and I'm sticking to it.

Subject: ICON Postscript

      By the way...since I got the end of the story today in the
paper, I thought I'd pass this along as a follow-up to the Icon
coverage.

      On Sunday late afternoon, I finished my last presentation and
got into the car to head back to the hotel to pack.  Robert Kaiser,
escort and driver assigned by the con, was driving the van and can
verify what follows.  We were about halfway to the hotel, on the
freeway, when I heard this very loud engine right outside, like a big,
loud motorcycle trying to pass.  I looked to the left, nothing.  Looked
to the right and behind.  Nothing.

      Then I looked forward...and saw two airplane wheels coming down
over the edge of the window.

      In any international language you can name, this is the symbol
for You Are Now In Serious Guano.

      A private plane was literally about five feet above the van.

      And coming down.  Fast.

      It got a little ahead of us, because it was still moving fast,
and it was obviously looking to try and put down on the freeway. 
Something was wrong.  It was about three or so car lengths ahead now,
but there wasn't room to put down, too many cars.  It suddenly lurched
down.  "It's going to hit the deck right in front of us," I realized. 
Then it abruptly pitched up again, as a bridge appeared in front of us,
and banked away to the right.

      The last I saw, it was banking and descending behind a line of
trees, apparently looking for somewhere, anywhere to set down before
the plane gave out.

      I didn't want to say anything until I knew the fate of whoever
was flying it; happily, according to newspaper reports, the three
passengers of the plane were injured when it crashed into the side of a
nearby house, but not killed.  They were taken to the nearby Medical
Center at Stony Brook, there in Long Island, and are now recovering.

      Took us a while to calm down.  After all the other adventures of
the convention...they threw a plane at us.  And almost got us...within
five feet, to be precise.  Had it gone down just roughly ninety seconds
before it did, I would almost certainly not be here to write this.

                                                                  jms

      I never ever give thought to ratios, or making a political
statement, or anything other than the story.  If that meant using 100%
female cast in the movie, or 100% male cast, or some variation thereof,
then that's what it'll be.  I think the *instant* you start putting
agendas ahead of the creative process, of saying "What is the story
*about*?" then I think you're dead.

      That's a Kinesis keyboard, which I've found very useful.  It's
cut back the discomfort quite a bit, and I recommend it, though it
takes a bit to get used to it.

      I've also just ordered a Datahand, which is a very radically
different design, though there's apparently an 8 week waiting list. 
I'll let folks know how that one works out.

                                                                  jms

      I still have to use a standard mouse, though I hate a mousepad,
so I usually just run it on the top of my leg.

      The keyboard cable is pretty standard, and should probably be
longer. I just keep it in my lap, on a lap-cat (a keyboard cushion),
and sit back and type my little brains out.

                                                                  jms

      Yes, there we noticed a lapse because the show was getting (and
still tends to be) a little too white-bread for my tastes, though we've
gotten a bit better lately.

      BTW, before I forget, try checking out www.datahand.com for
another kind of keyboard, the one I just ordered.  Can't vouch for it
yet, because I haven't tried it and am trying this on faith, but it's a
completely radical new design that was initially made for the Post
Office, and is now being sold commercially.

of truth by any government or political agenda.  We are made stronger
by a multiplicity of voices, and the more those voices are allowed
access to a level playing field, the more often the truth will come out

      No, I've said that while this one is okay, the characterization
is off, and it tries 'way too hard to be funny, ignoring the notion
that if everything is funny then *nothing* is funny.  Unfortunately, I
didn't get the actual manuscript until it was too late to do anything
short of commissioning a full rewrite, which they wouldn't do.

      Anyway...as I said, it's okay.  But for my money, the Anna
Sheridan and Jeffrey Sinclair books are the two real gems of this
batch.

       ISN is the one network that can handle *interstellar*

few specialized channels for military and some commercial use...but ISN

       David...I agree with you completely.  I find the cavalier

Everyone who saw that episode knows full well that it used massive
amounts of your material: your writing, your lines, your ideas, your
structure...it's all there.  The new stuff is just interwoven into it. 
That you aren't listed as one of the writers, that they never even

      Too bad no one's considered the idea that the Hugo here could be
viewed in another way.  That is...the DS9 episode was really a tribute
to the original "Tribbles" episode.  That was the whole reason they
*did* it, and the plot ties directly into that original episode.  If
you take away the original "Tribbles" script...there's nothing *there*.
They just weave in and out of your story.

      So if the DS9 episode is a tribute to your episode, then why
couldn't the Hugo be given *to the original episode*?  After all, it
was good enough for DS9 to pay tribute to, and in essence, simply
repackage it...why not follow in their footsteps and their intention?

      It ain't a ST series, it's a different show entirely.

      Came out of Majel's vault, and apparently they're going to have
to change the name to avoid any conflicts with Scientology and
Battlefield Earth.

      They'd asked if I'd be interested in running it, but I declined.
I think they've now got Rick Okie, from Renegade, on as
show-runner/writer basing the series on the provided material.

      No, but that (the vorlon question) is a philosophical issue. 
You hardly ever run into problems there...what kills you is doctrine,
based on a belief. If it weren't for doctrine, a lot of the world's
religions would get along a lot better, because the core roots of their
beliefs aren't that dissimilar, it's the interpretation and the rules
that grew up around them that seem to cause all the trouble.

Subject: B5 Fan Club Note (jms)

      One of the most dangerous things in the world is a writer who
has finished writing for a while, has met his deadlines, and can now
address other issues.

      One such issue that has been nibbling at the back of my
brainstem has been the Babylon 5 Fan Club.  I've felt for some time
that it was not living up to its potential, and has been laying fallow
for some while.  The Universe Today newsletter was okay, but it could
have been better.  The club was okay, but could have been better.

      Okay is never sufficient.  We either move forward or we fall
back, there is no such thing as holding position.  Especially with the
fan club, because as a fan myself, I have to feel that people are
getting their money's worth out of the club, and frankly, I'm not sure
they have been.  Now that I have time to turn my attention to the
problem....

      A number of changes have been made to improve the situation for
the current members, and for future members.

      1) We are going to substantially improve Universe Today and get
it out on schedule.  To facilitate this, we are announcing that Mike
Zmuda, publisher of the Centaurian Sentinel, probably the best of the
B5 fanzines out there, has been made editor of the newsletter.

      Sandra Bruckner, publisher of the Zocalo, has been named
co-editor. Both begin work effective May 1st.

      Knowing the great work these two have performed individually, we
have every anticipation that their combined efforts on Universe Today
will make it the sort of publication we've always wanted it to be.

      2) Sandra has also agreed to take over as website administrator
for thestation.com, maintaining it and improving it and updating it as
circumstances warrant.  The B5 Fan Club Web Site has also been
wandering a bit, and this will correct that problem.

      3) Jim Lockett, founding head of the B5 Fan Club, has moved on
to other projects, and we wish him all the best in his future
endeavors.

      4) A more assertive position will be taken in promoting the club
at conventions, in advertisements, and in developing merchandise
specific to the fan club.

      5) Finally, because of my sense that the members of the Fan Club
have not gotten all that they could have out of the club during its
debut, we are going to ROLL OVER ALL YEAR ONE MEMBERSHIPS to a second
year.  If you joined prior to April 1, 1997, you are automatically
comp'd in as a member for a second year without charge.  Doug and I
will personally swallow the expense of that.

      It is our desire that the Official Babylon 5 Fan Club should be
the best entity of its kind ever created.  Now that we have made some
mid-course corrections, we are back on track to becoming that.  And we
think you will approve of our plans for improving and expanding the
operation as we move ahead over the rest of 1997.

       Thanks.  It was noted to me at the time that a
Roddenberry/Straczynski collaboration would be very commerical, but on
looking at the material, I just felt it wasn't strong enough; at least,
I couldn't see where it could go, and thus felt it better to leave it
to others who potentially would not be limited by that, and could find
ways to make it work.
