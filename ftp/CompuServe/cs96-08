       My interest in poetry is fairly eclectic, and eccentric.  I go
from the classics to the obscure, but I'm not *really* as informed
about poetry as I should be.  My favorite stuff comes from the
Shelley/Byron period of English literature.  Tennyson is also obviously
a favorite.  Coleridge.  But then I jump right over into e.e. cummings
and Lawrence Ferlinghetti (no, I never really recovered from beat
poetry, some of it still works for me).  I tend to go for the more
structured poetry; free verse is okay to a point, but often gets
misused or used as an excuse for sloppy writing.

       No, you're correct...but he could only recognize him once he
actually saw him, and that didn't happen until he arrived at B5, after
which he wasn't in any condition to talk to anyone until after things
were over.

       It was also a very devastating war, and one of their mistakes
was that their were those who were entrusted to keep the past, sort of
a more advanced version of storytellers, who put all their data in one
basket, as it were...very possessive and jurisdictional.  When they and
that center of data were taken out, a lot was lost.  One drawback of a
very rigid and structued society.

      I don't think there's really a difference.  (Also,
philosophically, I think one can be experienced and still retain a
certain measure of innocence, but that's another discussion for another
time.)  I think we all have that part of ourselves which wishes to
believe, needs to believe in a cause or in other people , however many
times experience slaps us in the face with the contrary position...and
there is always the part which is tired and weary and burned out and
refuses to trust again.  We are all these things at different moments. 
The difference with writers is that we must be those different things
on command, and articulate those feelings through the voices of our 
characters as they experience them in new contexts.

      Some of the first ones just got bored after millions of years,
and went off in general.  The rest, for the most part, went beyond the
Rim for the same reason you cut down old trees to make room for new
ones.

      Listen to how the final track fades out; one has the strings in

{original post unavailable}

      That was really excellent.  Let me explain to you how excellent
it was: I was taking a break on CIS because I was trying to work
through the heart of a scene between Delenn and Sheridan in script 403.
It was a little fuzzy there in places, and I usually log off and putter
around rather than trying to write it when it isn't all there yet in my
head.  Your analysis helped me clarify something in my own mind which
was there in the first place but hadn't yet racked into focus yet.  It
would've done so eventually, it always does, but you may have saved me
an hour or two of going back over their relationship in my head and
pulling out the emotional and thematic undercurrents of what's been
established over the last couple of seasons.

      Good stuff.

      Jump gates go where gates have been constructed by long-range
explorer vessels.  Nobody near our tech has ever built anything outside
the known galaxy, or frankly through about 80% of what IS known.  Going
beyond is a one-way ticket.

      For one thing, it's a long, LONG trip outside the known
galaxy...it takes 3 days to go to Earth from B5, it's not
instantaneous...so you can well imagine how much time is involved in
getting outside the galaxy.  Second, a ship like the Aggy isn't
configured or capable of constructing a jump gate, that's up to the big
Explorer-class vessels.  Finally, the further you range afield from the
established series of hyperspace beacons, the greater the odds of
getting permanently lost out there, since points of reference outside 
aren't on a one-to-one basis with hyperspace.  (And outside the galaxy
you'd have little in the way of more conventional references as well.) 
So any trip would be a one way trip, at least at this point in our
technology.

      Mentioning or referencing books is tougher, because any segments
are less concise in general, less instantly recognizeable and
self-contained. And half the fun of the poetry references is the
lyrical aspect of it.

      Actually, that would've been Delenn who finally got the repaired

did a basic outline of what the follow-up (WWE) would be, so it'd all

      I'm definitely looking forward to the reaction.  Today, for
instance, we did the final audio mix of "Z'ha'dum," our third season
ending episode. All of the EFX were in place, the sound, the
music...and after we did the piecemeal mix, layering in things in a
stop-and-go fashion, we did our playback, watching it straight through.
I don't think anyone was breathing for the fourth act.  Everyone was
just wog-boggled.  The emotional impact of it all is quite strong.

      When the lights came up, and I looked around to the stunned
faces in the room, the only thing I could say was, "Welcome to history,
gentlemen."

      Looking forward to reactions?  Oh, yeah, I suppose you could say

      No, the only people in the room are those involved in the mix,
this isn't a screening, it's part of post-production.  It's me, John
Copeland, co-producer George Johnsen, the sound editors, mixers, sound
supervisor, a few others on the periphery.

      At one point, one of the mixers was working on putting in the
sounds as he went, hadn't yet gone through it all...and kept telling
the sound supervisor (who was asking questions about how we wanted to
handle some later scenes) "don't let me hear this, I don't want to
know, I just want to see what happens next, this is great."  Which in
this town, from folks who work on a lot of shows, is a good reaction.

       It's definitely intentional.  The purpose of any kind of art
should be to make you feel something.  If it's created with passion,
then the work mirrors the intensity of emotion felt by the creator,
passing it along to the viewer, who may not even recognize what's
happening, or be able to pin it down...but it's there.  I write very
passionately, and the show needs to feel passionate to be what I need
it to be.  Otherwise what's the point?

      The Minbari built the White Star, borrowing some Vorlon tech, so
it's primarily Minbari, and built with their sensibilities, all the
controls are in Minbari, and so on.  They allow Sheridan to command it
because Delenn said to do so, and in battle an unpredictable human
might have options that a more regimented Minbari might not.

her on board.

      Passion, as I've noted elsewhere, has become passe.  It's old
fashioned; the proper attitude now seems to be detatchment and
cynicism.  It doesn't help that so much of TV is done by rote,
recycling the same stories from place to place.  Interestingly, I think
we're seeing *less* of that in the last few years than in the entire
decade preceding, so maybe this is a good turn.

      Red Five is not from Star Wars...it's standard Air Force
designation on various teams, Red One, Blue Three, others in some
cases, Alpha One, Bravo Two in others.  People in and out of the
military have been color coding fighters and the like long, long before
there was a Star Wars.  There's a danger in assuming that the first
place you heard it was the place that invented it. There are some ST
fans who *insist* that ST invented the term tachyon, since that's where
they heard it first, and even have given me and other shows a hard time
when we use this actual scientific notion.

      It's likely a matter of both, choosing an element which is

their respective fathers, who would also be authority figures to
them...so it's both manipulation and emotion.

      Bringing actors in and out, and changing their characters, is
more or less always a story issue, so it's never a problem.  Londo,
which you mention, was always intended to go on his arc from comic
relief to something darker and more tragic.  That's his story; it was
his story long before any actors were ever hired.

      Thanks, the Sinclair material was very moving, I thought.

      As for the kiss...I knew everyone would be waiting for that
first kiss, so I made sure it was different, that it was a first kiss
for one of them, but not the other, that it was natural and totally
unforced and surprising. So for Sheridan, his first kiss of Delenn was
actually his second (by a long ways), and his second, when it comes,
will be her first.

      Just can't do anything the conventional way on this show....

where the story has to go, what benchmarks I need to hit en route to
the end, what my repertory group of characters consists of, and then I
start writing.

      As someone said of a battle, an outline never survives contact
with the enemy, which in this case is the actual writing.  The outline,
for me, is a safety net whose purpose is to keep me nominally on track
while allowing me the freedom to bounce around the landscape, adding
new threads, broadening out the storylines, fleshing out the
characters, and reorganizing how the characters move in and out of the
story.  That makes the work organic.  I still end up exactly where I
wanted to end up, but the road there is much more interesting than if
I'd just hewed to a very rigid structure.

      It's like driving from LA to San Diego...you can just jump on
the freeway, or knowing the freeway is there, jump off from time to
time to grab lunch at Pea Soup Anderson's or a quick ride or two at
Disneyland.

      And yeah, sometimes I have to work to keep the characters in
line. Londo's the worst.  He's always going off and pulling me in one
direction or the other, he's very peripatetic...and getting him talking
for dialogue is never hard...getting him to shut the hell UP for two
minutes so somebody else can get a word in, tha's hard.

      Writing is a very schizophrenic business.

                                                                  jms

      Two quick notes...what I said was that we wouldn't have cute
kids (or for that matter ANY kids) in as regular characters a la a
Wesley or the kid from SeaQuest.  We have, on rare occasions, had cute
kids in one-shot episodes...of course, they've generally ended up
shipped off or conveniently deceased....

       Thanks; all the characters are great in that one, and the line
was "never use this."

       Re: "face-acting"...this is something I've been working on a
bit lately in my scripts, letting the actor have a moment visually
without words to carry it.  When you're starting out in a show, and
everyone's new, you have a tendency to make sure that the emotions are
expressed in dialogue, in case the acting doesn't carry it off.  Then,
over time, you learn to relax and start playing the silences, using
only a word or two here and there.  A few scenes in some year 4 scripts
play almost like haiku.  You learn to trust your cast, and they respect
that trust and return it.

       I can't think of any of the cast who doesn't strongly believe
in the show, and the story...they know, on whatever level, that we're
doing something of value here, something that's going to be remembered
and talked about for a long time after we're gone.  Lord knows it ain't
the money, none of us are getting rich here.  They believe in the
story, and that's truly extraordinary.

                                                                  jms

      In general terms, a comic allows you to do things that you could
never afford to do in a TV series or movie.  There's the constraint of
the artist you choose...a great artist can elevate a book, a bad one
can sink it no matter how good the storytelling...and having grown up
on comics all my life, and enjoyed the work of Miller and Moore and
Gaiman and David and others, I think they're a terrific form of
expression and storytelling.

      In regards the Legion...setting aside the reality that after the
situation with the B5 comic, which I felt wasn't being done correctly,
and said so vociferously...if there's any book I'd love to do (after
any of the Superman titles), it'd be the Legion of Superheroes.  It's
gone through some tough times, mainly in the Giffin days which were as
much a screwup of the concept as Byrne's Superman, but I have a lot of
loyalty to the characters, having come into the title back at its
formation out of the pages of Adventure Comics.  I'd do it in a hot
second, but I'd want to take it a bit back to its roots, and I'm not
sure they'd go for that.

                                                                  jms

      I try to follow as much of the general conversation as I can,
but it's a lot to track.

      Re: the CIS/GEnie thing...I was one of the first people around
town to go on-line in the entertainment business.  I was logging onto
Compuserve back in 1984, when you could only get 300 baud access, off
the back of a Kaypro II computer with 128k floppy disks.  This was my
first online network, and I've known a lot of the people here for 12
years.  So there's a certain kinship here.

      With GEnie, that was the first online network to give B5 a real
chance of being anything; a topic, then two, then a whole category,
then two whole categories were set aside for it, and they've believed
in the show for a long time.  It took a lot longer for CIS to come
around and even note the show, or do some of the things that GEnie was
already doing.

      Those are pretty much the main distinctions in how I see the
two.

                                                                  jms

      When I can announce the overall year 4 title, I will.  Filming

sets today for the first time since we wrapped in May; it's just too
depressing to walk on a dead set.  Lots of work going on now, new sets

       Yeah, I've read the books during the rebuilding period, though
I haven't had time to indulge my comics habit for about six months or
so.  For some reason, though, it still feels wonky to me.  I confess
that as far as names go I still prefer Sun Boy to Inferno, and some of
the other renamings have been kinda dopey.  If you're going to change
it (and objectively I know Sun Boy is a bit goofy), you should go for
something a little better than, for instance, Lightning Lad to
Livewire.  Livewire is just an awful name.

      Thanks...and yeah, it happened again.  I'm writing 405, "The
Long Night," and there's something that one character was supposed to
do in the script, that had been the plan all along, that was my intent
even as near as 1 page from where it was going to happen...then just as
I got to that scene, another character stepped up and said, "no, let me
do it."  I was kinda flummoxed.  "You?!  You're the LAST person anyone
would think to do this." The character nodded.  "Exactly."  And the
symmetry was perfect, the impact would be greater...so that's who did
it.

      On one level, it's always wonderful when this happens; on
another, it scares the hell out of me....

      It's at the bottom of act two, you'll figure it out when you get
there.

      Thanks.  A lot of people are looking back at season 1 and
finding it better than they remembered, now that they know the
characters.  They also now see the little touches here and there
pointing forward in the storyline.

      The plot-recap stuff is difficult to pull off without being
obvious; you have to slip in the backstory a line at a time, here and
there, so new viewers can follow it but without annoying the constant
viewer.

      Actually, the new Vorlon's encounter suit is more purple/red
than green. The design is a matter of form following function.

      And yeah, I figured it might be cool to continue the song over
the credits.  That happens one more time this season.

      They weren't following Lyta.  We were in Kosh's old quarters,
and those images were burned into the wall when Kosh died.  Bear in
mind that she doesn't actually meet the new ambassador until the next
scene.

       My concern about detailed synopses comes from a number of
elements. One of the foremost...a not as detailed synopsis leaves some
room for surprises. Even if you want to know what happens, to have
every breath, every line given to you ahead of time diminishes the
*impact* of what you're seeing.  If someone says, "In this episode,
Kosh dies," then okay, you know it's coming...but you don't know *how*
it's coming, and that's half the fun.

       Second, when someone attempts to recreate a scene, inclusive of
dialogue and action descriptions, the episode itself becomes a hostage
to how well that's presented.  I can't tell you how many times I've
gotten email from people who said, "I read a detailed synopsis of this
episode before I saw it, and from the way it was described, it felt
really stupid...but then I saw it, and I liked it a lot better than the
way it was presented in the synopsis." It can mitigate against the
impact, and the quality, of an episode if it's not well presented.  A
simple by-the-numbers, blow-by-blow synopsis can flatten out any of the
drama.

       Will they watch it?  Likely yes.  Will the impact be
diminished? Yes. Can people approach the episode from a prejudiced
perspective thanks to a too-detailed synopsis?  Yes.  There are other
concerns even beyond this, but those will do for now.

       (And my problem with the other fellow wasn't so much the
synopsizing, as that was all he ever did, moments after the show, just
to be first, and never took part in anything else.)

                                                                  jms

       Again, you don't have to apologize, and I'm not looking for

one that leaves some room for surprises here and there.

       It's the Rim of the galaxy, and once you come out of hyperspace
past the galactic rim, all your points of reference are gone, and
getting back is tough, if not impossible...and you can't just "keep
going" in a straight line in hyperspace, as it's not a one-to-one

       It's all a matter of running new eps during sweeps.

       What's interesting -- when some fans of ST shows look for
something to badrap B5 about, using the ST ratings as a bludgeon -- the
ST ratings have been consistently sliding.  For the last several
quarters, the quarterly rating on DS9 has gone from 7.1 to 6.7, 5.9 and
as of July 4.6.

       B5's ratings per quarter have gone from 2.7 to 2.9, 3.0 and
3.1.  Why do I bring this up?  Because lately, in reruns, DS9 hit a 3.9
rating for the first time in reruns that I can think of (usually
they're in the 4s or low 5s) at about the same time we hit a 3.1 in
reruns, where usually it's a bit lower. So now there's only .8 between
us and DS9 in reruns, where the gap used to be huge.  So it should be
*very* interesting to see what happens when new episodes hit the air. 
I imagine they'll still be ahead, but the gap will, I suspect, be much
smaller.

{original post unavailable}

      Okay, John, lemme ask you a question, since you keep harping on
this issue of propaganda.

      You're the leader of an isolated space station with a quarter
million inhabitants, who need air, food, supplies, space, support.  You
no longer have ties to Earth, no support from there, no money, so you
have to rely on whatever docking fees you can get from other worlds. 
You're in the midst of a war in which you have few resources, little
money, allies that have a tendency to turn on one another, nobody's
giving you a break, your position is tenuous as hell, you're constantly
undermanned, shorthanded....

      Now you tell me where the heck you're going to get the time,
resources, money and manpower to launch a propaganda operation, which
if you're going to broadcast (and what's the point otherwise?) on an
interstellar basis is going to require extensive and expensive
facilities, broadcast repeaters, tacyhon carrier wave generators to get

      One doesn't have to believe in the existence of something to
write about it effectively...there aren't really Minbari or Vorlons,
y'know...you just decide to write about it as though it were a True
Thing.  And that's about how I approach religious characters.  As a
writer, you can choose to be honest in your characterization, or you
can use the medium for propaganda and the advancement of personal
agendas.  The latter holds no appeal for me.

      Never took it *as* criticism....

      To the question of why more folks don't do it, or as much or "as
well" (the last in that list being subjective and self-serving for me
to repeat), I think a large part of the problem may be that very often,
if you deal with religion in TV, ten gazillion pressure groups from
either side of the political spectrum jump up and down on your head
until it's reduced to guava jelly.  So folks get very tentative about
the area.

      Me, I've been on computer nets for 12 years, I'm used to people
jumping up on down on my head until it turns into guava jelly...no big.

      I commend C.S. Lewis to you as a writer first, and a theologian
second. As a writer, he does some nifty stuff...the Screwtape Letters
alone is worth his having walked among us.  The Perelandra (sp?)
books...are okay, but a bit dry sometimes.  His strength was in more
fantasy than SF.  As a theological writer, he had a tendency to set up
straw man arguments a bit too often and too easily for my tastes, but
he's certainly worth the read.

      So where is the problem with, let's say, a person putting up a
spoiler that says what basically happens in the episode, adding, "If
you want a more detailed analysis, email me and I'll send it along."

      But bear in mind, again, folks can post here whatever they want;
I'm not in a position to stop anyone.  If I have any moral authority on
an issue -- dubious since I'm not sure where I left my morals anyway --
that's fine, but I'm not going to pressure anybody to do
anything...that ain't how I work.  How people perceive me is beyond my
control, and when the poster here apologized for the long synopsis, I
told him he didn't have to do so.

      This really ain't a big issue, folks...I saw something, had a
gut reaction to it, and said what was on my mind.  I can't start
censoring what I think because someone might take it too much to
heart...yes, the person has a right to post what they want, and I have
an equal right to respond as I feel is appropriate.  I'm being as
honest in my reactions as anyone else.  Who in this room has a problem
with that?

      Unless you're saying I should just shut up when I see something
I feel strongly about...which seems to me just as bad as anything else
being discussed here.

      John...you're getting too wrapped up in this.  For starters,
having just had a MAJOR WAR with the Minbari, which nearly wiped out
Earth, and many folks back home *hating* the Minbari...do you think for
one second that they're going to believe a word of what the Minbari say
to them?  Do you think the government would allow this to go through
unjammed?  Hell, EarthGov would have a field day with this..."See? 
It's all alien propaganda, just like we told you, they're trying to
destabalize Earth."

      Second, I don't think the Minbari have the propagandists,
writers, directors, and others needed to put together a propaganda
network, and would find the whole idea immoral to begin with...and a
couple of paragraphs of text are meaningless...Earthgov says "it's not
true," and it's your word against theirs.  That's why you must have
absolute, unvarnished PROOF, otherwise it blows up in your face, which
any journalist worth his or her salt knows.

      Again your suggestions don't touch reality at any two contiguous
points.

seeing the afterflash. Only certain types can see it.

       Good point.

       It can sometimes be annoying...I know there was a fan meeting
of a certain group in the UK at one convention last year where they
insisted, in NO uncertain terms, that my statement about being an
atheist was just a cover, and that I was in fact a religious person
using that as a blind so I could get my views across.

       Language is a precise thing; if you do not say what you mean,
you can never mean what you say.  What I stated in this regard is the
simple truth. Anybody who can't handle that...should just have a little
faith.

       Three days is the time to the jumpgate off Io.  Once you're
within our solar system, it takes another several days or more to reach
Earth itself. It's fairly common to keep your jump gate a bit removed
from your "core" planet so you have warning if any agressors come out
of it.

       Yes, they do...but bear in mind that the Minbari are currently
having their own problems.  The Grey Council has fallen apart, the
Military Caste (as we'll see in one of the next episodes) is having
some serious doubts about how the Religious Caste is handling things,
and that much of the support given Earth (by way of B5) has been
covert; the White Star program was launched in secret, and the greater
amount of the Minbari population aren't aware they're so much "in bed"
with the humans (as it were).  As far as they're concerned, we're
apparently necessary to the plan, but not much more than that.  So I 
think they wouldn't be warm to the notion of extending their services
overmuch to Earth.

       You keep trying to make everything cut and dried, but in the B5
universe, there ain't no such critter.

      We suggested it to WB, and were turned down, on the grounds that
as a network, Fox can just go ahead and program what the want in those
hours, if it's a secrets-of special or something else; but PTEN isn't
really a network, it's a syndication division, and in syndication you
have to sell each item separately, so they'd have to go out and sell
that one hour special the same way they'd sell a series, and they were
loathe to do that.

       Many of the names we were considering don't audition; you know
their work or you don't.  Some did.  (It's bad form to indicate which
did what.)

       While I had a certain idea of the look for Sheridan in my head,
the one thing you learn as a producer is to keep an open mind when it
comes to casting, because sometimes something will happen that you
hadn't anticipated and you go with it.

       While I had the name Sheridan, I hadn't locked down his ethnic
background yet, and instructed our casting director accordingly.  I
wanted to see a range of people.  So we saw not just Caucasian actors,
but hispanics, african american, asian...I felt strongly after the
first season that we didn't have enough ethnic diversity, which is one
of the reasons we changed casting directors to one that had a wider
background in this area. As it turned out Bruce was the best person for
the role, but we went into the process open to whoever walked in the
door.

       I don't know specifically what's going on for Sunday...but I do

keep the second airing, and they are working to move the show into
better time slots. So going from 2 p.m. to 8 p.m. gives us a prime time
slot, which is *much* better for us.  I don't know if they'll keep the
Sunday rerun where it is, but there will be a rerun somewhere.

       All of them wanted to work more after ST; very few did, many of

if they said, "oh, well, I'm old now, I can retire."  At the time, most
were in their 40s, with Kelley being the oldest one there.  One doesn't
retire at 40 as an actor; you go on.  They've all talked about it.

      That's the question that's hard to answer, because stuff is
going out the door as fast as possible.  One batch of 1500 went out on
Thursday.  Was yours in there?  I don't know.  Part of the consistent
problem we're having is the Post Office.  They told us what the postage
should be for each packet and newsletter, first class (we sent the
first batches off bulk, and they got dumped, lost, delayed...never
again, we'll just take the loss and deal with it).  So we use that, and
turn it in at the post office.  Depending on which postal worker takes
the parcels, it goes through, or they send them back for more.  So now
we're increasing the postage to make sure they don't do this to us
again.  It's making Jim crazy.

      It was a number of things.  He looked like what I thought
Sheridan would look like, and had the right attitude.  He had a
reputation for being an actor associated with lightweight dramas
(though he was capable of much more), and I knew this would play in my
favor in that people would be set up for one thing, and then I'd yank
it in the other direction; even made sure that I gave him lightweight
dialogue, had a jolly attitude, for most of his first few episodes on
the show (exempting "Revelations").

      So when the first eps aired, and people were going on about
"smiling jack," I knew I had them set up for the whack-upside-the-head
that was coming down the road at them, and the character.

      (It's sometimes like an elaborate game of chess...I try to
anticipate the viewer reaction so I can, well, turn this on them and
use it to my own advantage.  Look at folks' initial reactions to Londo
and Vir as another example of this.  I've said before that I'm not
averse to taking aspects of the actor -- Mira's background in
Yugoslavia -- and using them for the benefit of the story, so you can
bet I'd be willing to do that with the audience as well.  I say if
people are going to apply their preconceptions to a character or an
actor, then it's perfectly fair game for me to turn this around on
them. So those who saw depth in Londo or Vir -- and were ploinked for
it -- got to see their suspicions confirmed (good result) and those who
thought they were just buffoons got to have their brains splattered
when they saw the depths that emerged (also a good result).  So why not
do this with Bruce?)

      Other reasons...Doug and John had worked with Bruce before, and
knew him to be a stand-up guy, loyal and honest and hardworking, a team
player, and a genuinely nice man who was far more talented than the
roles given to him before had let him show, more range and more colors
than he had previously had a chance to display.  He's also a stone SF
fan, both in media and literary SF, so I knew he'd have a great respect
for the story.

      I've been remembering some of the other choices we were
considering for Sheridan...James Earl Jones, John Rhys Davies, Barry
Bostwick, Michael York, Michael Moriarity, A. Martinez...but for me,
Bruce *was* Sheridan, and when it came time to make a decision, it was
him, hands-down.

                                                                  jms

      Sheridan commands the Army of Light, Delenn as second.  If the
AOL speaks with one voice on something of importance, they have to be
listened to. When Sheridan put himself on the front lines, he was then
taking on the role of soldier, not commander.  They also felt it risked
leaving them without said commander if it went wrong.

      Bear in mind that their orders in *no* way compromised his
actual mission, or over-rode his decision.  They were sending along a
secondary mission to keep an eye on the primary mission.  I don't see a
conflict here.

                                                                  jms

      We'll do more with the affiliations later on once more parts of
the station go on line.  For instance, we'll have various chat areas
set aside. If you're Earthforce, you can get into Earharts...if you're
a Centauri, you can't, but you'll have another area you can get into. 
When you get your quarters set up on B5 (you'll be able to actually
rent a residence on the station), if you're a Narn it'll be in the
alien sector, if you're Psi Corps it'll probably be Red
Sector...basically, we'll try, as much as possible, to replicate what
it would be like to actually live there.  Eventually we hope to 
introduce avatars in the chat area so you can appear visually in the
room as the species of your choice...with the thought that, in time,
people will be able to upload images of themselves and use those in the
chat area with the avatars...it's going to grow into something very
elaborate.

      Let me clarify, so I won't be misunderstood...Bruce was our
first choice after the change-over from Sinclair.  Bruce would not have
been right for the choice of Sinclair, but was right for Sheridan. 
Michael was right for Sinclair, would not have been right for Sheridan.

{original post had no questions}

      Just some comparisons to illustrate...during WW II, the head of
naval operations for the Japanese fleet insisted on being on board
during several of their more pivotal missions.  His subordinates
insisted that additional ships be sent as escorts given his importance
to war strategy.  That's a very rigid military structure, but when
*all* the subordinates get together on something, to go against it
causes more problems than it's worth.

      Even within the context of a conventional military situation,
there's flexibility.  If a commanding officer gives an order which is
immoral, illegal, or against the rules of engagement, a subordinate can
refuse to implement that order, even give a countermanding order which,
depending on the situation (such as a nuclear missile firing) would
take precedence over the CO's order (though you'd first have to relieve
the CO of command, and if you do that, you'd darned well better be
prepared to back it up with every legal and moral means at your
disposal, or it's mutiny).  Heck, it was just this kind of dilemma that
was at the core of the movie "Crimson Tide," and was brought up in the
recent war crime trials going on investigating what happened in Bosnia,
with a soldier being asked why he didn't refuse to carry out an order
to kill civilians.

      Ain't a lot of black-and-whites in the world, but a whole lotta
greys.

       That's good to hear, and I'm sure a number of other folks
started with the show when Bruce came on.  Whatever the cause, I'm
pleased with the effect.

       And don't feel bad about your initial attitude (assuming you
did); lots of folks had the same initial resistance, often out of a
sense of perceived loyalty to ST.  We learn by doing.

      Thanks.  To your questions...I haven't yet been invited back to
Marcon (I don't know if they've finalized their list yet), but if that
should happen, work schedule allowing, I would likely be there; and
yes, B5 has been sold to TNT for runs after the show has gone its
course, which will be the first time we'll have had a national timeslot
and a big network.

       S'okay...that generally happens on the show.  When we brought
in Vir, lots of folks moaned about what a mistake it was, "flounder in
space," they said...same with Walter Koenig...there were any number of
messages suggesting we lose Londo, and others...and after a while, when
they see what we're doing, they turn around.  Vir is now many folks'
favorite character, and Bruce has hit it as Sheridan for most everybody
now.

       Doesn't bother us anymore.
