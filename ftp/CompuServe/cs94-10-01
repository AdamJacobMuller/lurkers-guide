BABYLON 5: CHRYSALIS SPOILER #843485

     That explanation is in the very next episode.  Complete and

this will be resolved in the first episode of year two.

     Except, of course, that where everyone goes is important to
the rest of the story, and that the purpose of the episode is to
introduce massive change into the story overall; when Sinclair says
"Nothing's the same anymore," he's deadly serious, and so are we.
The changes won't just be transitory or for a season-end hook; these
are permanent and substantial changes in the arc.

     Thanks.  I've watched that episode, between rough cuts and
producers cuts and mixing and all the rest, something like a
dozen times...and it still gets to me.  Glad you feel the same.

BABYLON 5: CHRYSALIS OF COURSE #844818
DATE: TUES OCT 4, 1994 11:53:14 PM

     Correct; Garibaldi's aide has *always* been a plant.  I seeded him
in from the beginning, specifically for that purpose.  It was the aide
who got Sinclair out of his quarters in "Sky," was the liaison who got
Benson on line (also in security, you'll remember), and helped dispose
of the body. If you watch his reaction in "Sky," he's the one who brings
info to Garibaldi looking to clear Benson; and when Garibaldi sees through
it, you can see his aide move off looking very worried.

     Originally, it was Laurel Takashima who would have betrayed those
around her, as this character did.  When Laurel was transferred, I had
a choice: keep that arc for her replacement (Ivanova), or give this part
of it to someone else.  Now, knowing how the folks here on the nets and
elsewhere think, and knowing that they knew about the Laurel-possible-traitor
thread, I figured that everyone would assume that Ivanova would get that
part. (And, sure enough, a lot of people did.)  This became a wonderrfully
convenient blind behind which to build the *real* plant.

     And thus far, *nobody's* seen it coming.  He was right there in clear
view, we used him many times (also in "By Any Means Necessary," for
instance), and nobody ever paid him the slightest attention.

     It is, in a way, the classic magician's trick of misdirection: you
try to get everyone to look at your hand so they won't look at the huge
elephant being wheeled up onto the stage in plain sight.

                                                                    jms

her own body, not his.  Hence the hand.

JFK was killed.  The atmosphere on set was *very* strange that day....

BABYLON 5: B5 QUESTIONS FOR JMS #847021
RESPONSE-TO: SIMON GRIERSON
DATE: THURS OCT 6, 1994 9:50:02 PM

     The underground high-tech will be seen again, and will have a role
to play.

     Delenn is acting slightly outside the majority opinion of the Grey
Council in her actions.

     What's going on with Delenn is not supernatural.

     There's something going on between the Minbari and the Vorlons, but
that won't be clear for a bit longer yet.

     Jason Ironheart won't be returning anytime soon.  Not at all, really,
in any sense we understand.  I don't like omnipotent beings running around
in the storyline; makes some things too easy, and other things too hard.

     No, Delenn does not become Zathras.

     And no, I'm *definitely* not taking any kinds of ideas for stories,
for movies or for episodes, at this time.  The point of B5 is that it's
a self contained novel, which is already written out.  I've got more
stories in the B5 universe running around in my head than I could *ever*
use in all the episodes, books, comics and so on.  In putting together
all of the background information, the future story arc, the character
histories, I find myself in kind of a Tolkien-ish situation, where I have
far more material than I could ever use.  Also, receiving any kind of
story ideas here on the nets endangers my presence here for legal reasons.

     Finally...as a note, your message contains spoilers, and should be

BABYLON 5: ATTENTION UK B5 FANS! #839011
DATE: THURS SEP 29, 1994 5:19:17

     I'm piggy-backing this message onto Brett's for the UK viewers
out there.

     "Chrysalis" airs in just a few days in the UK...Monday evening.
I would have much preferred that it air more closely to the US
broadcast, or simultaneously, but PTEN chose otherwise.

     Of all the episodes I wrote for season one, this is probably the
best of them.  This one works on every single level, including the
acting, the directing, the lighting...all of it.  It's as close to a
perfect episode that we've done.

     As you'll discover in a few days, at least half of the show's
success is in the surprises, and the planned shocks along the way.
You'll know what I'm talking about instantly, when you see it.  As
stated before, we tip over every table we've got.

     Specific reactions and spoilers posted here will hit people
literally WEEKS before it airs.  The effect, I think, would be to
dilute the impact of the story profoundly.  So I would like to take
this opportunity to ask our UK friends for a personal favor.

     Obviously, discussing the episode on local UK systems is terrific,
no problem.  If it's possible, it'd be wonderful if you could be more
general or vague in comments here.  If you have specific questions
related to the story, I'll be happy to respond to anything posted
privately here.  I know and appreciate that this would be an
inconvenience, and there's nothing that obliges anyone to go along
with this.  I ask it only as a personal favor.

     It's not so much with the hole in Sinclair's mind (though that's

PROS AND PUBLISHING: WANTED - WRITERS #839612
DATE: FRI SEP 30, 1994 12:32:25 AM

     Of course, depending on how you choose to define "net revenue,"
and it can be defined so as to make it look as though there ARE no
net revenues, regardless of what may actually come in...it's possible
that the writers and artists could receive *zero* money.  (I work in
Hollywood, and I've seen how bookkeeping can make a huge profit into
a net loss.)

     There's no real way of knowing what "net profits" are until and
unless one audits your books.

     It is standard, professional behavior to offer a set fee, X-cents
per word, or a flat fee.  If you are not doing this, then I can only
conclude that something's profoundly wrong about this whole deal.

                                                                   jms
BABYLON 5: NO STORY IDEAS PLEASE #843490
DATE: MON OCT 3, 1994 7:21:01 PM

     Fox doesn't produce B5; it's Warners/PTEN, so Fox can't "can" the show.

     As for fan fiction...I try to discourage it where possible, primarily
if it's in a place where I can see it, to defuse any legal problems such as
the one that killed one of Marion Zimmer Bradley's books.  There are going
to be some B5 novels from Dell, but we're working with the writers of those
books to make sure they're *not* just unrelated throwaways, but are part of
B5 continuity, and thus nominally canon.

                                                                       jms

     Incorrect; now that she has been legally burned by it, MZB *is*
openly discouraging fans from "playing in her fiction," as you put it.

     A fan wrote an extended piece of fan fiction set in Zimmer's
universe, which ended up being very close to what Marion was working
on.  The publisher, aware of both, spiked Marion's novel for fear of
being sued.  A year or two of work down the drain.

                                                                 jms

     I don't think you're seeing my point; my question was why MZB would
have to sign a waiver, not the other person.  Getting a waiver or
disclaimer from the fan is, of course, fine.  But for MZB to sign a waiver
means that she is giving up rights to her own creation...why should she
have to do that?

     Thanks.  One thing that I think commends B5 to people is the sense --
which as Henry Kissinger said, "has the added benefit of being true" --
that the show is made by folks who *genuinely like SF*.  The majority of
people who work on B5 are fans...you walk down the halls and you see
evidence of this all over the place (particularly in the art department).

     So it's really a case of people making a show they'd like to watch
themselves.  It means respecting the audience because they/we *are* the
audience.

     "I like B5, but it's NO Star Trek."

     Thank you.  Weren't meant to be.

     That's not a dig, simply a statement of fact and intent.

     From some of the research done on the show, a *lot* of ST fans
tuned in to B5 expecting something kinda like ST...and when they saw
it wasn't it, figured it was a bad version of ST, rather than seeing
it simply as something utterly different.

     One could say, of NYPD Blue, "It's NO Cagney and Lacey."  Well,
no, it's not.  That's rather beside the point.

                                                                 jms
BABYLON 5: B5 AND COMMERCIALS #848387
DATE: SAT OCT 8, 1994 1:38:30 AM

      All b5 episodes consist of a teaser, four acts, and a tag.
I believe that ST is 5 acts and a teaser.  Our acts tend to be of
uneven length; we just write whatever feels appropriate.  Sometimes
an act can be 7 minutes, or 13 minutes, whatever is best for the story.
Overall we have the same number of commercials as ST or any other
syndicated series.
