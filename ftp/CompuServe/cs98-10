Subject: Lyta Question

 (blocked) asks:
> Why did Lyta train as a Psi Cop if she was only a P5?

"I was under the impression teeps needed to be at least P10 before
becoming Psi Cops. Why did Lyta train as a Psi Cop if she was only a
P5?"

      You are misremembering.  She said she interned with the Psi
Cops, not that she was training to be one.  Psi Cops need people
beneath them at various levels as assistants, collectors of evidence,
and all the more ordinary stuff they don't have time to do as the
elite.

                                                                  jms

"Whether it be in CIS fora or on the wider Net, it seems that more
people are spreading more rumors more widely with more reaction.  I
wonder if this will ever reach some sort of critical mass, and, if so,
what the result will be?"

      A slight but measurable increase in the greenhouse effect....

      Just a note to remind folks that my email address is to be used
only for stuff that can't or shouldn't be discussed publicly, for
personal stuff. It's starting to fill up with general questions about
the themes of the show, plot stuff and the like, questions which would
serve better in the open forums where the answers would profit other
people, and save me from having to answer the same question X-times
privately.

Subject: Who's going to V.O.R.

{original post unavailable}

      Be advised that Tracy Scoggins will not be there, and that
others may not be there, and that this is not an official, sanctioned
convention (many have emailed me to say that they thought it was
sanctioned).  The companies listed as "sponsors" -- Precedence
Publishing and Sierra FX -- are making it clear, and making VorCon make
sure it's clear, that they may be sponsoring events at the convention
but they do not endorse the convention itself; also, Optic Nerve will
not be bringing down an exhibit of any sort.  In addition, by now they
either have received or are about to receive official warning from 
Warner Bros. regarding the showing of *any* video material from the
show.

      WB does have that control over publishing as well...the thing
was published by accident, there was a drop in communication and it
happened when everyone was looking elsewhere.

Subject: Exec Producer powers?

{original post had no questions}

      It variers; in some cases, an exec producer is just the money
person; in other cases, it can even be a studio person assigned to a
project; there can be numerous exec producers with various
responsibilities.  Some sell the show, move on, and just collect fees.

      That's why the term exec producer has become almost meaningless
in terms of knowing what the person actually *does*, and why it's been
replaced in many ways with the term "show runner."  That's the person
who actually runs the show, determines the creative direction for the
series, writes and oversees scripts, that sort of thing.

                                                                  jms

Subject: new jms comic

      Posted this over on another system, figured I'd put it here as
well.

     Just thought I'd get this thread moving, though it's still a bit
  early, since news has started to break in other places.  Basically:
I've
  always loved comics (no secret there), and have always wanted to do
a
  title of my own, try to make it something special, as B5 was/is
special.

      I created the premise, went to Top Cow (my first and only choice
on
  this one), we met, we agreed...and now RISING STARS is set to debut
next
  April.  I've already turned in the first script (for the preview
issue),
  and will be getting down to writing issues 0 and 1 shortly.

      The story follows the events after the small town of Pederson,
  Illinois, is struck by a mass of energy from an unknown, but non-
  terrestrial source.  Everyone who was in utero at the time of the
flash
  is affected, resulting in 113 individuals who develop abilities of a
most
  unusual and highly individual form.  (The power is to some degree
shaped
  by who they are, just as they are shaped to some degree by the
power.)

       It is set in a realistic universe, timed to real-world events
(it
  covers a span of about 60 years, starting in about 1969), where
there
  have never been super-powered individuals before.  It looks at how
the
  world reacts to them, and how they react to the world.  We follow
these
  characters through their early years, into adulthood and to the ends
of
  their lives, mapping all the changes they go through, and how they
change
  the world.

       It's an extremely ambitious 24 issue miniseries (with the
potential
  to go back and further develop any of the stories presented earlier
along
  the way).

      Well, they'll have the scripts in plenty of time, so I can't see
any reason why there would be any problem in schedule.  I've learned in
B5 how to maintain a schedule.

      Thanks...what's great is that I've already heard from a number
of folks who don't generally buy comics, but will do so for this
particular title, so given B5's coverage, it may mean a good influx of
new people to discover the comics world.
