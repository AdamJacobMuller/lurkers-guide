       Yes, primarily because what Kosh was doing with Lyta (that
sounds vaguely suggestive) wasn't a one-time event.  There was a
transference going on, and that aspect will be heard from again.

                                                                  jms

       The storyline began millions of years ago.

       We're coming in in the middle of the story.

       But then, that can be said of all of us.

{original post unavailable}

      This is probably the most commonly asked question, and the
answer remains...I dunno.  Right now, the sheer task of getting this
show made now, for TV, is sufficiently daunting, that the idea of
telling it again in print is enough to make me tip over.  Also, this
show was *designed* for TV; if I'd wanted to write a nove, I'd've
written a novel.

      So for now, the answer remains "I dunno."

                                                                  jms

      Actually, I've no idea...I don't socialize at all -- except for
B5 related gatherings, I haven't been to a party in...oh, about 2
years, maybe a bit more.  So I don't tend to hear from anyone *not*
really involved with the show in terms of other TV writers or

      I don't think they quite knew *how* this show was to be sold to
the audience; the arc wasn't heavily played initially, no.  Later,
moreso.

      I hear all the time though from new viewers who just started
watching, and are right up to speed.

      Re: changing the episodic structure...no, can't really do that,
because you have to think in larger terms, both down the road and how
the show airs overseas, minus those breaks.

      The character-oriented wav and avi files weren't done because
there are still pending matters to be worked out with the various
unions -- SAG, WGA and DGA -- about how those are to be used.  It's
still a new medium, and how you reuse footage shot contractually for
purpose A, turned to use B, and what residual structure you follow, is
still being worked out.

      Thanks.  Also, our hard ratings shot up almost a full half a
point this quarter over our last batch of new episodes, from a 3.0, our
usual, to a 3.4, at a time when most syndicated shows were in a
downturn, including DS9, which went down over a full point during the
same period.  Warners is most pleased.

      Chris, the only thing wrong with your message, and your
assumptions, is that they're wrong on just about every conceivable
level.  Let me try to walk you through this to help you understand a
little better.

      First off...a general observation.  Story ideas are worthless. 
It's very doubtful that you or anybody else has had an idea that nobody
in the history of mankind has ever had before.  You can take a basic
idea and give it to 10 different writer and you'll get 10 TOTALLY
different stories.  What matters is execution, how the idea is
rendered.  An idea isn't a story, and what matters is *story*, a series
of consequences and reactions based on actions.

      Most amateur writers don't know or understand that, and think
that their story idea is something saleable, something somebody wants
to buy, or something they need to jealously protect.  There are even
people who will exploit that.  There was a publication a few years ago
which would publish your story idea in a big book, on per page (which
you paid for, natch), and sent it to the major studios and networks.

      Not one of them ever sold.  None of them were worth buying. 
None of them were really stories.  And it was thrown into the trash of
every studio or network at which it arrived because of fear of lawsuit.

      Now, to your points individually:

      "For one, I would talk with the individual and arrange something
legal so that his story idea could be used and he/she would receive
full credit plus pay."

      This is illegal.  There is no fee inside the Writer's Guild for
"story idea."  (ST tried to get around this for a few years, but was
finally trounced by the WGA.)  If it's a credible, WGA signatory, which
all the major studios and networks are, they can't operate outside
formal parameters in their agreements.  There's no category for "story
idea," so they can't buy that, and there's a reason for it.  A "story
idea" is sufficiently general that it can't be readily surrounded...is
it a sentence?  A paragraph?  A page?  Two pages? You could start
taking whole stories, swiping them, and getting the royalties
 -- thousands and thousands of dollars -- while the originator of the
story got a couple hundred bucks, if that much.  This provision exists
to *protect* writers.

      See, part of the problem is, you're looking at the TV writing
business not as a writer, but as a fan, a viewer.  We who work in this
business have had to painstakingly, and at great suffering, fight for
protections for those who work in this business as their livelihood. 
Creating a scenario such as the one you describe would hurt the
profession beyond description.  Yes, you may like the show, but should
we set into place practices and policies that will undo years of
hard-won strikes, and create what is, in essence, the camel's nose in
the tent...the camel -- studios who would exploit this to take stories
and outlines for zero money -- would surely follow, on the logic that 
if you permit this for one show, you have to permit it for all.

      (Also, for the "full credit plus pay" part...again, what credit,
and what pay?  There's no provisions set up for either.  You'd have to
create whole new areas in the WGA for this, which don't currently
exist; you can't just do this willy-nilly.  Pay...a flat fee?  Fee plus
residuals?  How do you determine how much a 1 paragraph story should
get vs. a two or three page story?  Which gets a flat fee and which
residuals?  It's a slippery slope.)

"Secondly, if I created a forum and opened it to fans who wanted to
give their ideas for stories, etc., then I would post a message at the
beginning of the forum stating that anything spoken and written in that
forum cannot be protected by law."

      Now you're in violation of US Copyright Law.  Anything you write
is instantly yours under what's known as Commonlaw Copyright.  In
addition, a forum like Compuserve copyrights all content as a communal
copyright, owned by both parties, the poster and CIS.  (All services
work this way.)  Also under the law, you cannot make a statement or a
policy which removes people's rights from them...in other words, you
can SAY that anyone posting messages gies up their rights...but that
doesn't have *any* legal basis whatsoever, and cannot be enforced.  The
only way would be to have each person type up a waiver, hard-copy, sign
it, get it notarized, and mail it *for each and every suggestion*
giving up all rights to that specific story.  It can't be done en masse
for anything written.

"Lastly, how would one prove in court that someone has stolen someone
elses idea.  If I write a show that was truly my idea, how do you
defend yourself from some crazed lunatic coming into court saying that
I stole it from him/her?"

      That's the hard part.  You can't.  Sure, you can win the case in
court, but a case like this can take two or three YEARS of your life. 
And most will hang on because most cases like this are settled,
regardless of merit, because it's cheaper than a trial.  Do you want to
spend two or three days a week, every week, for three years giving
depositions, talking to lawyers, dredging out every bit of paperwork,
turning over your computer files to lawyers, having your friends and
co-workers deposed, your character challenged, all because somebody
posted a story idea that was vaguely similar to what you did? I don't.

"How can that person prove it was theirs to begin with?"

      By showing a printup of the story as posted in the forum you
have suggested here.  (Or another.)  Their word not good enough?  You
subpoena the sysops here, access the CIS database, on and on.

"An idea is an idea.  Buck Rogers had the idea of stargates in it's
series. Babylon 5 uses the jumpgates. It's the same idea, but how could
one sue the other for stealing it? What about space battles in
general?"

      See, again, here's the problem...a stargate or a jumpgate isn't
an idea, it's a bit of technology.  You can't build a story around
that, so it's not a story idea, again you're not clear on your terms. 
"How about a jump gate?" isn't a story idea.  "How about a jumpgate to
go kill the giant frog monster in sector 97" *is* a story idea.  Once
again, you don't have a clear notion what it is you're discussing.

"Cloaked ships? The shadows cloak themselves, but how would the Trek
guys sue JMS for stealing their idea about cloaking technology?"

      Shadow vessels don't cloak; they have alternate technology for
phasing in from hyperspace.

"It's plain silly and it's a waste of everyone's time."

      It is...until you end up in court for it.  The ONLY reasonable
protection is the no-story provision.  Especially in a case like B5,
where the whole story is *already worked out*.

      It's the difference in perception between an amateur writer and
a writer who does this as a living.  (By "amateur" I don't mean bad, I
just mean one who is either unpublished, inexperienced, or a
hobbyist...I'm an amateur bowler, as an example.)  You don't understand
the consequences of this sort of thing, it's not a profession to you,
it's something you'd like to toss out there.  But it can hurt.  Marion
Zimmer Bradley recently found herself in a *terrible* position...she'd
worked for about 2 years writing a new novel, turned it in...and had
the book cancled by her publisher because a fanzine to which she had
possible access had published a very similar story and they might sue. 
Two years of work, down the drain.

      This isn't a game, or a hobby, or something where you can make
up the rules as you go.  Writing is a *business*, a creative one, yes,
but if you're going to make a living at it, you have to treat it as a
business, just as if you're a carpenter or a plumber or a surgeon. 
Those rules are there to protect writers from being expoited,
harrassed, ripped off or sued.

                                                                  jms

"How do the studios get around buying a book to make into a movie or
tv show? I mean in many cases if you compare the book to the movie,
there isn't a whole lot left except the basic storyline."

      They don't get around buying the book; they *do* buy the book. 
No, when all is said and done, the result may not look much like the
book, but that's a matter of creative realization of the project --
artistic success or failure
 -- not legalities.

"And didn't you sell B5 as an idea?  Not a complete story?"

      Again, define "idea."  The way Chris defined it, an "idea" is,
"Let's do a show on a space station."

      You also have to remember that like many other writer/producers,
I'm in a position where I've shown that I'm capable of taking something
and making it into a TV show.  But even so, like every other person
there trying to sell a series to PTEN, I didn't just walk in the door
with an idea.

      If you're going to sell a series, you need to know the
characters, the situations, the possible additional storylines, the
support network and supporting characters...all of that.  What usually
happens is that you go to a network, with a long list of credits, and
spin out a few details of what you have in mind: the central character,
the situation, some additional characters, how you'd get in and out of
stories, and the like.  There's been a LOT of prior thought given to
it, it's a LOT more than just an idea.  Then the network gives you seed
money (called "development money") to take that proposal and flesh it
out, writing a treatment and series bible, then a pilot script.  Based
on ALL THAT, you then get or don't get your series.

      When a writer comes in to pitch for a series already on the air,
he or she has the beginning, middle and end of the story worked out,
and some of the high points along the way.  Every so often, somebody'll
come in and try to sell an idea, just a notion...and you want to hurt
them.  I was working on MURDER, SHE WROTE and a guy came in to pitch
his story.  "Okay," I said, "what did you have in mind?"

      "Amnesia" he said, then sat back, pleased with himself.

      I waited.  Glaciers slowly moved across the northern polar
frontier. "What about it?" I asked finally.

      "*Amnesia*," he said again, as though repeating it would
suddenly make me understand.

      "WHOSE amnesia?" I asked.  "Who forgets what, what's been
forgotten, and where do we go with it?"

      "Well, we'd work that out after I get the assignment."

      He was never invited back.

                                                                  jms

Subject: Sidebars 2: Cabaret

      I wouldn't say Cabaret was my favorite movie of all time, but
it's certainly one of my tops, and that one scene, "Tomorrow Belongs to
Me" still scares the hell out of me.

      If I had to delineate my favorite films overall, they'd be
Seconds, They Might Be Giants, Forbidden Planet, The Stuntman, A
Christmas Story, The Empire Strikes Back, Cabaret, Failsafe, Seven Days
in May, Aliens, All That Jazz, The Day the Earth Stood Still, Glory,
The Haunting of Hill House, Road Warrior, Terminator 1 and 2, The
Natural, Network, Something Wicked This Way Comes, The Rocky Horror
Picture Show, Phantom of the Paradise, When Worlds Collide, The Seven
Faces of Dr. Lao, The Shootist, War of the Worlds, Stalag 17, and The 
Time Machine.

      Those are films I can watch again and again and never get bored
with them.  Lao is a particular favorite, it's just a beautiful film. 
I tend to love films that break your heart or make it soar, or both at
the same time, like Glory, or Giants.

                                                                  jms

      Thanks.  Yes, I sometimes do get notions for stories with our
characters outside the B5 arc.  Earlier stuff, later stuff...you just
sorta file it away. I'll probably never get to telling any of it, but
it helps add truth to the writing because I know what they're doing
elsewhere and elsewhen.  Those tales will probably never be told.

      It's been general policy for WB to look the other way on that as
long as proper copyright notices are appended.

Avalon and Vir. Other than that, you're on your own.

      WB has generally handled B5's publicity, though we've lately
hired our own publicists to help gain additional exposure.

      Parodies don't bother me.

      Newsletters have begun going out; posters and fan club packets
have had to wait until we got everything worked out.  Remember, please,
everybody, that the FC is a new creation, was not a going concern;
those who got in at the very beginning will have a short wait that
those joining thereafter won't have.  As with everything else we do, we
try and do it *right*.  If that takes a bit longer, so be it.  (I sent
back the new poster design twice for small changes and improvements,
which alone put things back.)

      I liked "Unforgiven" quite a bit, but it isn't a film that I
could watch endlessly, or often.  The others are films that catch me up
and take me someplace I enjoy returning to, and if I'm channel surfing
and happen to land on one of them, I generally tend to stay.

      Certainly, one theme of the show is how we each deal with the
traumas that beset us, and the choices we make.  The difference is in
how we handle them.  In "Shadow" and "Interludes" both Londo and
Sheridan have to confront somewhat similar losses: the death of a loved
one.  But Sheridan, at the last, was willing to suck in the pain and do
what was right, however much it grieved him, and forego
revenge...Londo, on the other hand, has embraced revenge.

                                                                  jms

{original post unavailable}

      I actually went to a mix of schools; four different high
schools, a dozen or so grade and junior high schools...some were
public, some were parochial (catholic) schools.  The last time I
stepped into a catholic school was in my first year of high school at
St. Benedict's High School in Matawan, New Jersey.  After, oh, about
six months they asked me to leave, on the theory that I was
troublesome, asked impertinent questions, and had a tendency to poke
holes in whichever theological discussion was underway at the moment. 
So I got blipped over to Matawan Regional High School, and stayed
public thereafter...though still getting into trouble from time to time
for asking too many questions and refusing to take "because I said so"
as ANY kind of legitimate response.

      So yes, while I do have some experience with catholicism, I
wasn't in any way raised, trained or educated by those intellectual pit
bulls of religion, the Jesuits.  The last time I had anything to do
with it at all was about the same time as the above incident, wherein I
was told, at the first session of this religious doctrination session,
that Confirmation was "the sacrament of free choice."  I wanted this
clarified -- religious rules were always tricky, and you didn't want to
get on the wrong side of anything as positive as hell (to paraphrase
Christopher Fry) -- and asked, "So this one we can choose or not, we
don't have to be here, right?"  The nun said yes, that's corr---

      She never finished the word, as there was no longer a "me"
standing in the room, only a jms-shaped silhouette made of the dust
kicked up by my sudden and rocket-like departure, rather like a Warner
Bros. cartoon, which disappeared before her eyes.

      Bottom line...I have *always* been a pain in the ass.

                                                                  jms

      That's good to hear from the ABA booths.  Thanks.

      Re: the fan/pro relationship (which can be difficult at
times)...yes, I do tend to think that because many SF pros come from
the ranks of fans, it makes them more receptive to and sympathetic to
that side of things.  It makes me *very* annoyed to see people who've
stood in line for 1, 2 or 3 hours for an autograph being turned aside. 
If I have any control over this, I won't have it.  (The only time I
haven't been in control of this was at Wolf, where a number of folks
were turned aside, and that's something the organizers and I have to
discuss for next time.  I also found out, after the fact, that some 
folks were turned away from the Forbidden Planet signing because they
brought stuff instead of buying, and that was NEVER a condition that
I'd agreed to or even knew about, and I'm quite unhappy about that.)

      Generally speaking, I don't care how long I have to sit there
and sign, ain't *nobody* walking away empty handed if I can help it. 
Because I've been in that position myself.

      Thanks.  It's primarily an effort to integrate the real world
into the series.  So much of SF on television tends to take place in a
vacuum.  The leader of the Federation is always the leader of the
Federation, we rarely hear about squabbling, elections, economic
problems, dissident groups breaking away...and when we do it's usually
a misunderstanding or basically good people with a different agenda
that can be quickly resolved.

      I think that integrating all of those elements lends an
atmosphere of verisimilitude to the story, making it all the more
*real*.

      "Neverwhere" will probably show up either on PBS or Bravo, since
it comes off the BBC.

      I've seen the "Dark Skies" pilot...it's kind of a hodge podge of
stuff. Parts are very effective, some aspects stretch credulity...but a
pilot can be a poor indicator of the series, so I'll definitely give it
a shot when the regular show begins.

       Y'know, every time a character gets introduced on this show,
there's always somebody who yells about killing him off.  I've been
told by folks on the nets, variously, to kill Londo ("Who's the jerk in
the Bozo hair?  He's a joke, he's ruining the show, space him!"), Vir
("Flounder in space?  Give me a break, he's nothing, throw him out an
airlock!"), Lennier and others, including Sheridan ("He smiles too
much, what's the deal, Smilin' Jack," which was a setup for his fall). 
Many people screamed to kill Sinclair during the first season...and
then were the first ones wanting him back a year later.

       And in each case, they went on to become some of our most
popular characters.

       Patience is a virtue.  We get to know people over time.  See
their strengths and weaknesses over time.  There's a lot more to Marcus
than meets the eye...and many people *do* like Marcus' character quite
a lot.

       The sad thing to me is to see folks who, if they don't
instantly spark to someone, say "Kill him!!!"  Which seems to me rather
cruel and intolerant for just not sparking to someone.  I wonder if
they have friends, or if they meet someone and instantly don't take to
them, do they wait in an alley and blow their brains out...or give them
time to grow...or at least take a wait-and-see attitude.  I sometimes
wonder about a society that breeds the notion that if you don't like a
character, let's *kill* them. Not, "let's not feature him," not "write
him out," but KILL him.  There's something rather disturbing in that.

       But...if Marcus doesn't work for you, he doesn't work for you. 
He does work for others.  And he works for me.

       I think you're outnumbered.

                                                                  jms

      Thanks.  Basically, you hire actors by the season.  You hire
someone for, say, 13 episodes out of 22.  That actor has a pay-or-play
*guarantee* of 13 episodes.  We may only end up using him in 11, but he
gets paid for all 13 regardless.  So that allows the actor to plan his
year effectively.  The contract for all actors has an option for the
following year at the producer's discretion.  When we get the word on
renewal, we can then choose whether or not to bring an actor back,
assuming we haven't already decided this earlier and killed the
character off.

      Depends on the writer.  Freelance writing almost always takes
longer because they don't know, and can't be *expected* to know, the
show as well as you do if you're on staff.  You can have several pitch
meetings over the course of weeks before a good story walks in (though
in the case of B5 the stories are generally assigned out by me, saving
that process); then you wait anywhere from 1-3 weeks for the outline;
you have a meeting about it; another week or so for the revised
outline; you have another meeting; then about 2-4 weeks for the first
draft script; then another meeting; then another 1-3 weeks for the
second draft.  (These are *optimal* periods, sometimes it's shorter, 
but usually it's longer.)  And then, on a show as eccentric as B5, you
often end up rewriting large portions of it anyway.  So it can take as
much as 2 months or more to produce a shootable script.

      I can write a script in 7 days or less, that's ready to go
before the camera as written.  Which isn't to say anything qualitative,
only to say that it's easier and faster because I'm inside the bubble.

                                                                  jms

      No, what I said was that *time* works about the same way in
hyperspace, not distance, nor that there was necessarily a proportional
1-1 corrolation between realspace and hyperspace.  There's still some
distance involved in hyperspace, yes, though again there isn't always a
1-1 corrolation.  It takes 3 days to get to Earth.  It takes 4 days to
get to Centauri Prime, even though CP is almost twice the distance from
B5.  It's *extremely* confusing to navigate hyperspace, which is why
you need the beacons and transfer points, or it's extremely easy to get
permanently lost.

                                                                  jms

      No, of course there's free will.  But if I pull a trigger, and
the bullet flies out hitting someone in the head, what happens between
the moment of the trigger, and the impact, has nothing to do with free
will.  Sheridan made the choice -- free will -- to do what was done in
WWE.  There were two probable results, depending on whether he did or
didn't do as asked.  Once he did that, the two probabilities folded
into one actuality (a la Shroedinger's Cat).

      Which doesn't mean to say he won't *try* to change things....

       Hyperspace isn't like warp speed, you don't generally run into

same thing for the next guy who asks, on and on and on.)

       I can't get into detailed, exhaustive discussions of the plot
or story or characters *in private email*.  If your question is a good
or a valid one, it should be posted in a public forum, so that others
can benefit from the answer.  Otherwise either I end up writing pages
of information over and over again, and nobody else gets the
information, or I just decline to answer the question.

       The *only* reason for using email is if it's a personal or a
confidential question, or something you don't want to say on the nets
for whatever reason.  Please help me to keep my head above water by not
using email unless there's a valid reason for it.

       If there *is* something you need to express in email, please
use the genie address (straczynski@genie.geis.com) instead of the
compuserve address, because the CIS emailbox can only hold 100 letters
at a time; any more than that which arrive get bumped and sent back or
deleted.  I lost an important piece of email regarding B5 business
today because it got shoved out by a letter asking me to explain the
differences in organization and accountability to oders between the
religious and military castes of Minbari.

       Bear in mind that with CTS, it *hurts* to type.  The more I
type, the more it hurts.  (Please don't send me any more info on CTS,
btw...I have all the available information on CTS, more than most
doctors right now, and to type a thank you note for each one that comes
in just makes the problem worse.)  If a question needs answering,
better if I can answer it once, so everyone can see it, than 15 times
for one person at a time.  Every keystroke you see from me comes with
discomfort.

       Please try and use the email address(es) only if there's a
valid reason for it; otherwise, let others benefit from the sharpness
and quality of your question by asking it publicly.

                                                                  jms

      Actually, the White Star doesn't go to Earth in "Severed," it
goes in "Messages from Earth," and it's stated in dialogue that it
takes 3 days in that episode as well.

      There's been some on economics, not nearly enough, though.

      Yes, on all TV series, the studio owns the copyright and all
that entails.  That's why ST in all its forms is (c) Paramount, not
Roddenberry.

      I don't generally watch any of the ST shows.  I like X-Files
quite a bit, haven't seen virtually anything of Sliders...though I can
tell you now that the next big, nifty show to come along in the
fantasy/sf genre is going to be "Neverwhere" by Neil Gaiman.  I've seen
a couple of episodes of it, and it's neat.  Look for it later in the
year or spring.  (It's from the BBC.)

      Refa is a powerful guy now, with powerful allies; he needs
money, in large amounts, and more influence, so when and if Refa would
get it, there wouldn't be the kinds of repercussions that might
otherwise come, as with a mafia hit, for instance.

      We're going after the pirates.  On the model front...basically,
all that has to happen is for a model company to come to us and make a
deal to produce the models.  (A decent sized company.)  So far, none of
them have, on the theory that only ST models sell from TV shows.  Maybe
if they heard from consumers interested in B5 models, they'd come to us
and make a deal.

      I can't think of any higher compliment than to be included in
