                     | Hello Jerry thanks for joining us!!!
                     | JD: A pleasure!
                     | What are you filming tonight?
                     | JD: I'm doing a guest starring shot on 
                     |   "Renegade" a CBS show.
                     | THanks for taking this break during filming.
                     |   Tell us ...
                     |   You were a stockbroker just five years ago...
                     |   HOW did you go from Wall Street to Tinsel 
                     |   Town Ave. in just five years?
                     | JD: I quit Wall Street in 1990...
                     |   I was bored not happy...despite being 
                     |   wealthy...I wanted to get into
                     |   something exciting...I was either going 
                     |   to buy a boat and head for the
                     |   islands OR decided to give acting a try. 
                     |   I got very lucky fast in Hollywood!
                     | Jerry, what did you think about the role on 
                     |   the show when you first saw the script?
                     | JD: I thought Garibaldi was a screwed-up , 
                     |   confused, funny character...
                     |   and I liked the fact that he had so many 
                     |   problems...there would be so many ways to 
                     |   play the character!
                     | How much of the character is your 
                     |   interpretation and how much did the producers
                     |   tell you to do?
                     | JD: As an actor, you rea the script and the 
                     |   words are a map to where the story
                     |   is going...you use your own "Spin" on the 
                     |   character...
                     |   as the series progresses,the ...the 
                     |   writers get to know you better...you know 
                     |   them better...you start
                     |   working together to develop he character!
                     | How old are you Jerry?
                     | JD: 39 years old.
                     | what were your media influences? TV, 
                     |   music..etc???
                     | JD: My favorite movies were "Sound of Music," 
                     |   "Animal House,"...
                     |   "Dark Shadows," "I Dream of Jeannie," ...
                     |   music--Eric Clapton, Elton John, Doobie 
                     |   Brothers.
                     | Since you hit stardom relatively quickly...
                     |   is it all that people think it is...or just a 
                     |   really fun job?
                     | JD: The job is a blast!...
                     |   when you break down what an actor does on 
                     |   a given day....
                     |   they feed you, make-you-up, tell you what 
                     |   to say...
                     |   there's 175 people involved with the 
                     |   show...and you only see 10 of us...
                     |   it's the crew members that are as 
                     |   important as the actors!
                     |   They stay and work on the show after we 
                     |   have gone home!
                     |   ALL jobs are importnat on the set!
Eliot Stein [WIZOP]  | JOE RUFFOLO GO AHEAD!!!!
Joe Ruffolo          | Jerry, You make the charecter look so easy. 
                     |   When it it fall into place for you?
Eliot Stein [WIZOP]  | JD: I fooled you all!!!!...
                     |   I think he's an easy character to play 
                     |   because he's so screwed up...
                     |   we all have our own faults...and if you 
                     |   try and deal with them as you
                     |   go through lie day to day--with a sense 
                     |   of humore...
Joe Ruffolo          | Ahhh, Thank You!!
Eliot Stein [WIZOP]  | JD: who knows? Maybe I was as screwed up as 
                     |   the character and they needed me!

Eliot Stein [WIZOP]  | The topic is JERRY DOYLE star of Babylon 5 is 
                     |   lIVE..
                     |   NEXT question....
                     |   JASON...are you ready? Please respond if so.
JASON                | Do you really like doing Science-Fiction, or 
                     |   would you rather do drama or some other form of 
                     |   acting?  
                     |   How do like the cast of Babylon 5?
Eliot Stein [WIZOP]  | JD: BABYLON 5 is a drama that happens to be 
                     |   in the science fiction genre...
JASON                | Thank you very much.
Eliot Stein [WIZOP]  | JD: so regardless of whether it is a western 
                     |   or a courtroom drama...
                     |   what's important is the STORY!...
                     |   I don't view Babylon 5 as one type of 
                     |   show. If somebody wants to pay me
                     |   $20 million I'll do any kind of acting!

                     |   screwed up.

Eliot Stein [WIZOP]  | JD: Storylines---...
                     |   I think you can tell from the end of the 
                     |   second season what is going to happen...
                     |   a big war is coming...a big mother 
                     |   battle...
                     |   it's going to be great...
                     |   NON-STOP fooling around from the minute 
                     |   you get there till the minute you
