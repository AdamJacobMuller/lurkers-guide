       Yes, they had some of their servants and allies taking care of
things; whenever a signal was sent, and a ship found, they'd dispatch
one of the standby ships to go and pick it up, slowly regathering their
forces.

{original post unavailable}

       All good points...might even be true.  I have nothing to do
with 'em anymore, so it's moot in any event.

       The new season starts this week.

       There's one other aspect to this whole thing which was brought
home to me in something Ellen Datlow said on MSNBC the other week.  She
pointed out, with deadly accuracy, that once upon a time, movies tended
to mine SF novels for their stories.  Now, it's movies and TV that
drive novels, with endless ST books, books based on movies,
novelizations, the whole Star Wars Empire stuff, on and on and on. 
You'd think that an organization of SF writers would want to be more
involved in the mass media that was changing the way their field buys
books, and what they buy, since it has a direct effect on their 
livelihood.

       By working *with* the media, they would have a better chance of
helping SF film and TV producers understand what SF is, and what books
are out there they can option.  That could lead to more movies based on
books, more option money for writers, and so on.  It's a provincial
attitude that is going to continue to do them great harm in the long
run.  But SFWA, for all its SF trappings, is remarkably short-sighted
when it comes to alternate storytelling technologies.

                                                                  jms

      There's very little we can do about local situations such as
this; the main contract period where they have to follow the schedule
is during new episodes.  During reruns, they're often all over the map.

{original post unavailable}

       I think your points are valid...the question, for me, is *why*
they are valid.  Yes, what you describe is what the studio folks
*think* is SF. Because they don't know any better.

       Lemme take this away from SF for a moment to make the point. 
For the last 45 years, the networks and studios thought cop shows were
all of a piece. If you really sit back and look at them objectively,
most cop shows were more adventure shoot-em-ups than anything else, the
bad guy has a plot, the good guys try and stop him...they had very
little bearing on reality. The occasional exception, like a Hill Street
Blues, was just that, an exception and not repeated.  The networks
thought that's what a cop show WAS.  Police Story and Jake and the
Fatman and Cannon and all the rest.

       Then along came a book...Homicide: Life in the Killing Streets,
which was trotted over to the networks with startling speed.  It was a
gritty, inside look at how this stuff *really* works.  And as with one
voice, the networks said, "Oh, so THAT'S how it works," and then you
instantly had the Homicide TV series, and NYPD Blue and others
fast-tracking to be real cop shows.

       They can course correct *real* fast if you know how to approach
them. Do the studio heads *really* appreciate cop stories now more than
before? No, not really, their eyes are still on the bottom line of
finances.  But they now allow these sorts of stories to be done.

       You can do the same thing with SF.  We've done a little of that
with B5, and now there are more shows coming up with long-range story
arcs, from Space Cases to Dark Skies to others now in development. 
We've done stories in aresa not usually considered covered by SF, from
religion to the death penalty to other areas.  We've educated.  Not a
lot, I'm not exaggerating our influence, but a little...and that's a
start.  More could be done if the SF publishing community got off its
butt and addressed the media rather than running from it or deriding it
or simply ignoring it, in the belief that if they close their eyes it's
not there anymore.

       SF writers, more than anyone else, should understand the
dangers of not keeping up with changes in technology in the areas in
which you work.

                                                                  jms

2 October 1996 TO: Joe Straczynski FROM: Harlan Ellison Re: Posting on
B5 General topic pursuant to your fax of 1 October 96

Joe: Here's the response we discussed via telecon this morning.  If
you would post it for me, I'd be appreciative.  - he

Dear Mary Cree:

       As you likely know, I am--how shall I happily put
this?--"netless in Gaza."  That is to say, Joe Straczynski is posting
this for me.  Had I your home address, I would have hand-typed an
actual letter, and signed it with one of my lovely fountain pens, and
mailed it directly to you; and you'd have had a small, but for-real,
artifact.  Rather than this nebulous electronic simulacrum, sans human
signature...the traditional mark of establishing that the message comes
from the heart of the sender.

       Here's the long and the short of it: I have waited thirty and
more years for your letter.  I cannot, in any human tongue, express my
gratitude for your comments and encomia.

       I hint, in the introductory essay to CITY ON THE EDGE OF
FOREVER, at the circumstances that conspired to jostle, prod, and
chivvy me to the point of writing the book.  Delineating those
circumstances would take yet *another* 45,000 word essay.  I choose to
give *that* odious chore a regal pass.

       Insofar as the reality of writing the long introductory
material to CITY is concerned, I was an *extremely* reluctant virgin
brought to that nuptial bed.  Had I let the whole idea go a-bornilng, I
would probably have been just as content...and continued to live with
that ugly little feral hatred gnawing at my composure for the remaining
years of my life.  But the forces massed, and I wrote the book, and now
it's out there doing incredibly well (much to my suprirse), and I guess
it's all worth it.  Because, in some measure, I received your note.

       I never realized, till I got into the writing of CITY, just how
angry I was, nor even how deeply I'd been hurt by what happened.  The
writing was like crawling across the most exhausting Gobi Altai one
could imagine, only to be offered, at the oasis, not a glass of
Perrier, but a large peanut butter sandwich.  Nonetheless, I did it,
and it was done, and out there-- twice-- and I could cease ruminating
on what a crappy chapter it had been in my carer.

       I didn't realize I was waiting for your letter.  That I'd
written the book *just to get your letter*.  But now I know.

       Thank you, every so much.  Respectfully,

      It's something we're considering; we had her do the entire

       True...and of course the Chrysalis situation wasn't our fault;
we delivered to WB the right pieces, but they had their satellite
facility rebuild it after they messed up the broadcsat...and used the
wrong piece for that shot, the pre-composite raw footage.

       Again, I think we're more on the same side of the issue than
not...I'd just point out a very basic truism that does, or should,
matter.

       If producers are more aware of SF novels, and SF writers, they
will likely option more properties for film and TV.  If they're not,
they will option fewer.  That's an absolute loss of income to SF
writers.

       But it's their business, not mine.

      The Vorlons were cooperating in the recent past, yes, and it
still takes a couple of Minbari cruisers under most circumstances to
take out an immobilized shadow vessel, though one can do it if the
firepower is concentrated and prolonged.

Subject: Say it ain't so, Joe!

{original post had no questions}

      Obviously there's a lot I can't say...obviously the fact that
PTEN as a functioning entity really no longer exists is a
factor...obviously no show ever gets more than one season's commitment
at a time, unless you're a Spielberg or the like...and there's a lot
that I just can't say because of the position of WB, and because,
frankly, I just don't know anything for certain.

      All I can say is this:

      That at the time of renewal, a number of parties at WB assumed
that this would be our final year, in large measure because PTEN was
vanishing, and you simply don't continue to pay out money on an
enterprise that no longer exists; you cash out the assets, stop
spending money, and start making profit.  I know that many people there
operated under that assumption.

      Then the later ratings started to come in...and people at WB
began to notice that our reruns were now doing what our first-runs used
to do...and gradually those same people began to say much the opposite.
I can say that, as recently as last week, WB was asking about a fifth
year, and what we would do.  As of 24 hours ago, we've been in
considerable negotiations for 2 two hour original movies for TNT set
during the arc, and WB is looking at the possibility of a
sequel...which would, in theory, be set up in part during a fifth year.

      So you've got some who say there won't be a fifth year, some who
say there might be a fifth year, and some who say there *will* be a
fifth year.

      Through all this, I am constructing and honing the story to
ensure that it will get through to its conclusion.

      The assumption in all this is that anybody knows ANYdamnthing
out here. But as William Goldman noted, nobody knows *anything*.  That
somehow I have *THE ANSWER* to the question, and am simply declining to
answer.  WB doesn't know, and I don't know, and anybody who says they
*do* know is either woefully misinformed or deliberately lying.

       There's a time bomb built into B5; instead of the usual 7 year
options, we only took 5, building a hedge against our own greed.  If
this show as it stands now were to go past 5, everyone would be able to
renegotiate...actors, subcontractors, suppliers, everybody.  At which
point it would be too expensive to produce anymore.

       The new CGI effects are stellar (as it were).  I defy *anybody*
who doesn't know the difference just from knowing what's gone before to
tell the older shots from the new ones.  (We've always reused some
shots, usually establishers and the like.)  I sure can't tell them

       It's a moot point...yes, you can scan in a script, but a) only
if you have access to it, and b) you still have to go through massive
amounts of work making sure it's all properly spaced and laid out.

{original post had no questions}

       You mention how ST brought people into the SF fold who
nominally hadn't been there before...I've been noticing much the same
phenomenon at the conventions I've been attending.  Even at the most
recent Necronomicon, the number of people over what the convention
normally gets (there were about 700 over their normal attendence) was
almost exactly equal to the number of people who came there strictly
for the B5 stuff...and the majority of them, from what we could
determine, had never been to a convention before, and for the most part
weren't into other SF shows...many didn't watch much TV at ALL except
for B5 and a couple others.

       You can see the new group sort of sliding itself into the
larger "melting pot" of fandom.

       Interesting to see the pattern repeating.

      What might be interesting, next time you pick up the book, is to
fire up a copy of "The Coming of Shadows" and go through it with the
script in hand...it's a good way of seeing how you lay out a show
shot-for-shot.  And since there's stuff there that was cut from the
episode, you can also judge on what was left out, and why, and whether
it hurt or helped.

HELP!  I got zapped tonight!  Someone sent me what they SAID was a
picture his kid made of a Starfury, said it'd be great if I could say
an encouraging word or two about it.  So I downloaded the file, and it
turned out to be a booby trap.  (No, I can't trace back the user, it's
off the internet, and the address was an anon...didn't write it down.)

Anyway, it DELETED MY DOS DIRECTORY and started to delete my Windows
directory as well before I caught it at the last moment.  (Yes, it was
a com file, and I stupidly didn't look to check before activating it
with the newsreader's program.)  I've managed to restore nearly all the
Windows directory (except for win.exe which is utterly gone).  I used
Norton to do that part...but Norton Unerase only seems to work in a
directory that's still there.  The DOS directory is completely *gone*. 
Is there any way I can restore it?  I can try moving the DOS directory
from my work computer to the home one (they're the same systems, and
arrived within days of one another, so they should be nearly the same),
but I'm obviously leery.

When it runs through my autoexec.bat file, I get the following errors:

Bad or missing C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE

Bad or missing C:\DOS\HIMEM.SYS

(I figure those'll come back after DOS is restored, but I'm less sure
about the other ones following:)

HMA not available; loading DOS low

Bad or missing COMMAND interpreter Bad command or file name Bad
command or file name

(I'm not altogether sure that's from autoexec. or the config.sys file,
by the way...could be either.)

This isn't the sort of thing I've ever had to deal with before, and
will take ANY advice from someone knowledgeable.  I have scripts to
write, and this is a major problem for me right now.

       I'm going to take the command.com file off one of my rescue
disks that I made for this computer (alas, they can't restore the dos)
and my hope is that that'll be clean.

       And now the kicker.

       There's also a text file in that directory that wasn't there
before. It contains 3 words.  STAR TREK RULES!

       Fortunately, I caught it before too much damage was done.

       Yep, they're still offered...and taken...because it's important
to at least keep the *concept* of profit alive, however bastardized the
form.

       Fr'instance...I don't have a gross profit percentage of B5.  I
have a small *net* profit.  Which, as we all know, means I'll never see
a *dime* out of it.  The only part where I have a piece is an (even
smaller) percentage of the gross is in...merchandising, the one area in
which I've dragged my feet from day one.

screwed.  At this point I've got the Dos directory restored (using the
files from the twin computer at work), and so far it *seems* to be

      Bear in mind that all of Refa's people were *back on Centauri
Prime*. He didn't bring them with him; to send word to Centauri Prime
to bring them all the way out here, then on to Narn, would double the
time required to get there, and by then the "rescue" would've been
over.  That was part of Londo's scheme...he wouldn't have much time, he
had to get in and get out.  Refa only brought a few with him, and they
were needed to watch Londo and guard Vir.

      As for the Centauri back home...you proceed from the assumption
that all Centauri act as one.  I'm basing this somewhat on the early
Roman civilization and government, where one side would sell out the
other, arrange for deaths and murders, turn people over to their hated
enemies as long as it advanced their position, or if they were allied
with persons of power on a particular side.  Why did the Roman guards
escorting Tiberius (a much less worthy emperor) kill the heir to the
throne in "I, Claudius" (a much better leader, and well liked among the
military)?  Because they were told to do so.

      SF in TV has the tendency to portray aliens as monolithic...they
put the good of their species as a whole above everything else.  Some
do that; some do not.  Just as with humans.

       To know how to rename all the hundreds of files in my
windows\system directory, is there any way to save to a file all of the
file names in my directory, so I can bring that one file home with all
their names?  (I know, I should do a print screen, but the printer here
at the office is broken, and I'd have to hook up another one from
another office, which is a pain.)

       Also, how does one uncompile a .com file?  I think I caught the
Trojan Horse before it did anything else, but I kinda want to open it
up and look inside in case it did anything else I should know about. 
Don't want to go through all this and get another surprise in a few

      At this point (note to all who've emailed...there were so many
not everyone could possibly get a response), the system itself is up
and running again, having transplanted the DOS directory from my work
computer (an identical system) to the one at home.  I then used unerase
to restore the Windows and windows/system files.

      Alas, the only way to unerase is to give the deleted files a new
first letter or number...and I didn't know what they might be offhand
(there are something like 200-350 of them altogether in the windows and
windows/system directories), so I kinda had to rename them randomly,
just temporarily.  Now I have a list of the proper names of what the
files *should* be, and now I'm going through the long process of
matching them up and renaming them all.

      My virus scanners are all windows based, so once it's up again,
I'll be able to go looking around a bit more.

      It seems to me that the problems you cite are really ones you've
put onto it, frankly.  They don't really have anything to do with
what's being *done*, only with what you're projecting *might* be done. 
And in some cases, your information is simply incorrect.

"While I'm playing devil's advocate, what about Anna??  I thought
shadow ships only worked with telepaths, you telling me that Psi Cops
didn't spot Anna was telepathic - I don't think so!!"

      Incorrect.  Ivanova even says, "Delenn never said that was
required." A shadow vessel can use *any* body and brain of sufficiently
evolved form as its CPU...the whole purpose of picking up teeps was to
start putting together ships that could withstand telepathic jamming. 
That was the whole *point* of "Ship of Tears."

"I have a fundemental problem with this, namely, that unless JMS pulls
something absolutely extrodinary out of the bag, we are going to end
up with a quick and dirty fix, not what I think B5 is known for."

      Translation: you haven't figured out yet how I'm going to pull
this off, so you're making an assumption based on what you can't figure
out.  Why not wait and actually *see* what happens before judging?

"Another failing, the shadow ship with Mr G's ship in, historically
speaking we know that the shadow ships take people in, they are "wired"
into it, that suggests a centre of operations.  For a Starfury to fit
inside a shadow ship, it's gonna loose an awful lot of itself, I don't

      Again, you're not paying sufficient attention, and citing it as
a problem in the show.  Not everything it encounters is or has to be
wired into it.  Remember "Shadow Dancing"?  You see Anna's ship being
released by a shadow vessel and flying off.  It wasn't in the *center*
of operations, it was held in the skin of the thing.  Look at how *big*
these things are. They're huge.  (Compare the size of the Narn attack
ships and the shadow vessels in "Coming of Shadows" for a good
perspective.)  They can function almost like an aircraft carrier,
holding ships within their skin as they fly through hyperspace, then
releasing them on at a time, or by separating a piece of that skin and
firing them as a group (as also seen in the show).

"Maybe JMS should take 5 and step back from the problem a bit."

      And maybe you should wait to see what I do first, then decide. 
Because what you're pointing to as problems have *nothing* to do with
what I'm planning to do with the show.

      At this point (note to all who've emailed...there were so many
not everyone could possibly get a response), the system itself is up
and running again, having transplanted the DOS directory from my work
computer (an identical system) to the one at home.  I then used unerase
to restore the Windows and windows/system files.

      Alas, the only way to unerase is to give the deleted files a new
first letter or number...and I didn't know what they might be offhand
(there are something like 200-350 of them altogether in the windows and
windows/system directories), so I kinda had to rename them randomly,
just temporarily.  Now I have a list of the proper names of what the
files *should* be, and now I'm going through the long process of
matching them up and renaming them all.

      My virus scanners are all windows based, so once it's up again,
I'll be able to go looking around a bit more.

      Thanks to all who've helped.

      It seems to me that the problems you cite are really ones you've
put onto it, frankly.  They don't really have anything to do with
what's being *done*, only with what you're projecting *might* be done. 
And in some cases, your information is simply incorrect.

"While I'm playing devil's advocate, what about Anna??  I thought
shadow ships only worked with telepaths, you telling me that Psi Cops
didn't spot Anna was telepathic - I don't think so!!"

      Incorrect.  Ivanova even says, "Delenn never said that was
required." A shadow vessel can use *any* body and brain of sufficiently
evolved form as its CPU...the whole purpose of picking up teeps was to
start putting together ships that could withstand telepathic jamming. 
That was the whole *point* of "Ship of Tears."

"I have a fundemental problem with this, namely, that unless JMS pulls
something absolutely extrodinary out of the bag, we are going to end
up with a quick and dirty fix, not what I think B5 is known for."

      Translation: you haven't figured out yet how I'm going to pull
this off, so you're making an assumption based on what you can't figure
out.  Why not wait and actually *see* what happens before judging?

"Another failing, the shadow ship with Mr G's ship in, historically
speaking we know that the shadow ships take people in, they are "wired"
into it, that suggests a centre of operations.  For a Starfury to fit
inside a shadow ship, it's gonna loose an awful lot of itself, I don't
see it - sorry!"

      Again, you're not paying sufficient attention, and citing it as
a problem in the show.  Not everything it encounters is or has to be

Subject: BABYLON 5 SEASON FINALE

{original post had no questions}

       Here's how to work this out, for the earliest possible start
date for S4 in the UK.  This may not be what actually works out, I'm
not committing C4 to anything here, only indicating the *earliest* it
could theoretically be done.

       We finish shooting May 5th.  It takes about 52 days to finish
post production on a given episode.  Figure 2 months, round it off. 
That's July 5th for delivery on 422.  Maybe add a week or two just to
allow for glitches. So now July 19th.  We have to allow C4 to go
through the episodes for censor purposes, and that takes about another
couple/three weeks, so now we're at the end of July/first week of
August.  That becomes now the earliest you can conceivably air 422.

       So now you just do the math: 22 weeks from the first week of
August would mean that March 10th or 17th would be the absolute
earliest that the show could debut.  If they wanted to build in a
cushion to prevent any possible conflicts, then the ideal date would be
around the first week of April.

       But, again, I don't speak for C4, or their prior scheduling
committments, I'm just backtracking to when it would be feasible from
a production standpoint.

       I think that if Londo sent word via the Babcom unit that he
wanted a one-to-one with G'Kar, and that thousands of Narn lives were
on the line, he would come.  G'Kar has nothing to fear from Londo as

      Okay, a couple of responses....

      "Seems to me the strategy is: wait in hyperspace "near" the
flock of refugee ships, and when they signal for help (as they will
when the Shadow fleet appears), pop out of hyperspace and engage the
Shadow fleet.  The point is, the Shadow fleet is going after a known
target (or so Sheridan guesses), if you hang around near the target,
they will tell you when the attackers appear.  No need to for your
ships, even a scout, to sit in normal space, the refugee ships are all
"scout ships" in a sense."

      Massive logic problem.  If you wait until they're right on top
of the refugee ships, or very near, they'll just dive into the midst of
the refugee ships and there's no way you can have a clean battle
without resulting in *MASSIVE* amounts of civilian casualties.  What
you suggest would all but insure that the refugee ships would be
destroyed (defeating the purpose of the mission) and the piles of
civilian ships running for cover in every direction would hinder our
side, but not the other side, and we'd lose even MORE of our own ships.

      "2) Delenn and Sheridan spend the night together and we get to
watch... comercials. Talk about giving "short shrift" to a rather
interesting event. Couldn't this have been pushed into a different
episode?  I mean, here they are, alone together, in a "ostensibly"
romantic situation, lots for them to talk about I should think.  Well,
I'd like to know what was said... And what do we see?  Sheridan is
already asleep!"

      It's not a matter of being pressed for time.  The whole point of
the ritual was to watch him sleeping.  We had that nice moment right
before they took off with the fleet, and bunches of others, including
the big kiss, right in the previous episode and throughout the whole
thing.

      "3) I think the battle could have been done with a bit more of
an "umph" to it.  Perhaps the use of intercutting between the two plots
was distracting in this case.  It was a good battle, just not quite as
effective as "Severed Dreams" or "Long Twilight Struggle" (which did
have effective intercutting)."

      That's because there was more emotional content to the other two
battles you mention; the bombing of the Narn homeworld, and EA fighting
EA in SD.  Not all battles are created equal, it's a matter of context.
You can't expect to get exactly the same reaction to all of them.

      I cannot give authorization, it's not mine to give, it has to

game, and that is a large part of where you're getting into trouble.

      I understand that your error is one of enthusiasm, nothing else,
and I appreciate the enthusiasm...but understand that when I say WB

shut down at least one other sim group, maybe more.  I'm basically
trying to steer you clear of trouble, and there's no way to do this

      So they could drive any other ships toward the center, into the
killing zone.  If they come in into the center, everybody splits in
every possible direction, and that makes running 'em all down harder.

      Nothing at all insulting in the question.  It's a hard one to
address, but I'll give it a shot.

      Harlan says, when someone comes up to you and says, "Listen,
when I read your story, I saw you had structured the whole thing around
the Jungian notion of inner conflict vs. external conflict, and...." 
that the proper response is, "Absolutely, and you're the first person
to figure that out," whether it's true or not.  Let them think you're
an utter genius.  (This was, obviously, somewhat tongue in cheek, but
there's some truth there, I think.)

      Generally, some of the "deeper meanings" attached to the work
are less a product of what's written, as what's perceived and how it's
perceived; it's a function of what you, the viewer, bring to the table.
In that respect, a good story is like a Rohrscarch test (and I think I
just hideously misspelled that).

      Some of the hidden meanings or subtext (the more proper term, I
think) are deliberately set in place during the writing process.

      And there are some that slip past me, when I get ambushed by my
own subsconscious.  Often I'm working something through myself at the
time, or going through something, and when I'm not looking, the writing
part of my brain shoots it out onto the page.  Then, afterward,
sometimes minutes later or months later, I'll look at it and suddenly
realize what was going through my mind at the time, and realize I've
given away more of myself than I had intended.  It's an awkward
feeling...like coming home from a party and discovering that your fly
was undone the whole time.  There are times I'd like nothing more than
to take my subsconscious out and give it a *really* good thwacking when
it does this to me.

      Sometimes those meanings are very personal ones, sometimes more
general in nature, trying to figure out stuff.  The only way to stop it
is to ride herd on the part of your brain that does the writing, making
sure nothing slips past you...but then it becomes a more mechanical
process.  As a writer, you learn to listen to the small, tiny voice in
the back of your head and trust it, that it knows where it's going even
if the logical part of your brain does not.  You have to get rid of the
gatekeeping, get rid of what you were taught writing is supposed to be,
get rid of what you think others want to hear from you, get rid of
*everything* that gets in the way and overpowers that small voice.

      If you do that correctly, then you are *always* surprised by
what comes out, which is necessary; if you cannot surprise yourself,
you have no chance of surprising an audience.

                                                                  jms

      Yes, but that tactic works only if you know you're going to be
under attack.  If the shadows were to materialize in the midst of the
refugee ships, they'd just scatter in every direction.  The purpose is
to wipe out all those ships quickly and efficiently...so you start at
the outer fringe, drive everyone inward, and then wipe them all out. 
To jump into the middle of them makes it very hard to do this...it's
like herding kittens.

                                                                  jms

       Actually, no, most refugee ships are NOT jump capable. 
Remember, it takes a LOT of power...you've got the heavy cruisers, and
long range exploratory vessels, and not much else.  That's what makes
the White Star so special, that it can be as small as it is and still
generate a jump point. The Asimov class passenger liners, for instance,
can't jump, and have to rely on gates.  The smaller ships the refugees
would've been using would have had to get to their local gate, and then
line up to go through it in small groups. Which means 85% of them
would've been trapped there, ducks in a shooting gallery.

                                                                  jms

       I dunno...I just thunk it up as efficient and ruthless.  I
guess it comes naturally when you're a producer.

       I can't answer that, because the two elements are always the

don't know how I do what I do, I just kinda do it.

       I don't know, but I suspect it's best left unidentified...and
undisturbed.

       Can't remember the artists offhand, but the plates will feature
each of our major characters in turn; Sheridan is first, then Delenn,
then I think we've got Ivanova, Londo, G'Kar, others.

       Thanks.  A writer's job is to stay vulnerable, and explore
everything in the writing...the drama, the tragedy, the comedy, the
weirdness...it's all part of the package.  I just sometimes put a
little too much out there, I think.

                                                                  jms

      Yeah, it's primarily a personal comfort issue.  It's kinda like
standing naked in front of ten million of your best friends....
