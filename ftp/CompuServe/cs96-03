Subject: Violating Your Privacy

       All messages entered into the Compuserve system are copyrighted
by CIS, and the user; they cannot be posted elsewhere without the
permission of the sender, and the system.  Mine are somewhat of an
exception, since they can be posted anywhere, but even there I had to
write specifically to AOL giving permission before they'd allow my
messages from here to be reprinted. It is always required to do this;
otherwise it's not only morally repugnant, it's illegal.

       A user named Theron Fuller has just taken a great number of
your messages posted on the DS9 and B5 folders and reposted them to the
Internet (rec.arts.sf.tv.babylon5).  Among those users whose messages
have been taken without their knowledge or permission are Rae
Augenstein, Anthony Davis, and Jose J. Ortiz Carlo.  There are
apparently more.  To verify this all you need to do is go over to that
forum and look for threads with "so you miss Joe Straczynski's
dialogue" -- or words to that effect -- in the thread.

       From Theron's own statements, these were excerpted from a
*mailing list* which some individuals maintain for the sole purpose of
forwarding messages they think will do me harm.  Or in general, to keep
track of me, as stalkers do.  (This statement by Theron is also in the
same thread there.) One individual has indicated that this mailing list
was maintained by the Hall Brothers.  So apparently your compuserve
messages (and AOL messages, and who knows how many others) have been
circulated without your knowledge or permission, posted and reposted on
other forums, and mailing lists.  And now he has begun posting your
messages publicly.

       This is a violation of both your copyright and that of
Compuserve. It is morally and ethically repugnant.  It is illegal.

       If you object, I suggest you contact Compuserve and register
your displeasure with this, and also the postmaster at Theron's
account, since he was the one who publicly violated your copyright, and
took your messages without your permission.  (The users cited, btw, are
only the ones noted in the current batch of messages he reposted; the
odds are good that virtually *everyone* here has been excerpted and
remailed/reposted since this mailing list has been going on for some
time.)  I would suggest you demand to have access to the mailing list
of all reposted messages from Compuserve (and that those on other
services do the same).

       Theron Fuller's user id is fuller@ix.netcom.com and the
postmaster can likely be found there.  I would also suggest that the
sysops here lodge a formal protest, and get CIS to do the same, in
order to protect the rights not only of CIS, but of the users to post
here and know that their words will not be excerpted, reposted, or
otherwise used in or out of context without their knowledge or
permission.

                                                                  jms

       I agree; Fry's work must be read or heard aloud to be most
fully appreciated.  It has a wonderful cadence, and the vocablary is
really quite extraordinary.  Some of his imagery is amazing.  I don't
know if Marcus is so much in that vein as it might be, but there are
probably some influences here and there.  Certainly when he winds up he
can pick up some of that cadence....

       No, I don't mind if my messages get reposted all over; I've

of flight to be gravity defying.

       The video recorders are made of an extremely ultralight
material, new alloys that in total weighs less than an ounce; it has a
visible (and audible) air propulsion system, a high speed fan with a
stabalizer/gyroscope that keeps it steady, and move it forward.

       Not per se, no; you can have one picking up a frame later, but
there are still time gaps in *story*.  Between 1 and 2 there's only a
few hours; but between 2 and 3 there's several days or so.

       There is no permanent solution; but people should be aware of
this, in case they do have a problem with it, so that they can at least
know it's going on...at most perhaps encourage those doing this to
cease by virtue of complaining about it to them or to their service
providers.

       Yes, a lot of stuff is coming together in the story now.  We've
set up a lot over the last 2 years, now is the time to begin paying it
all off, resolving threads left hanging, and moving the show to a

       Correct, the Alexander would've come off the assembly line a

       Franklin is of the breed of officers who feels it isn't his

       What you're forgetting in the conversation is the issue of
copyright. As a poster here on this forum, everything that you write is
the joint copyright of you and CIS.  Copyright infringement is
punishable by law.  Now maybe one can't keep chasing down people who
take others' messages and shut down their access to various systems,
it's problematic...but for each time one engages in copyright
infringement, the *minimum* penalty under the law is $100,000 per
instance.  If one chose to pursue it that far.

       It'd be no different than taking a whole section of, say, a
Greg Bear novel, and posting it on the nets without his permission.

                                                                  jms

       No, Stephen, you've got that backward.  We had booked Foxworth
long in advance.  Later, out of the blue, a rep for the actor said that
by accident he'd been double-booked on B5 and DS9 for the same
period...and even though we had prior claim, because the other was a
two-parter, more money, they went for that.  One can only wonder when
the other offer *really* came in....

       Also, there was a PBS documentary this past week on the

       Well, there are a number of factors going into this, including
that as we develop threads over time, they become apparent outside even
before the script appears (as noted by some who've anticipated some
revelations here, in broad strokes).

       One other element is that B5 is only able to do what we do on
budget because we prepare a LONG time in advance.  We have scripts on
the deck, ready to shoot, 4-6 weeks sometimes before we roll film. 
During that time, scripts circulate to agents and others as casting and
other production elements start moving.  In many TV shows, the script
often doesn't land on the stage floor until a few days before
filming...in some cases, pages are still landing *as* they're filming.

       Once an episode is filmed, a 7 day process, it takes 52 days of
post production before it's ready to air.

                                                                  jms

{original post had no questions}

       Short version: anyone with even minor celebrity -- and there
can be no more minor a celebrity than a producer -- attracts a certain
number of what can only be described as stalkers.  Stalkers range from
vaguely annoying to disturbing (and disturbed) individuals.  I have
acquired about six or so who are dedicated to one singular goal: trying
to disrupt my life, my career and my show through a constant, chronic
pattern of abuse, insults, outright fabrications, disinformation
campaigns, and innuendo.  Six doesn't seem like a lot, and in the
grander scheme, they're irrelevant; on the less grand level, because
they are singularly dedicated to this cause, utterly tireless, they 
can, and have, paralyzed whole discussion areas, poisoned topics and
made places on the net unlivable for me and many others.

       Several of them, if they were doing via other means -- mail,
phone, in person -- what they are doing on the nets, could easily be
arrested and prosecuted under any of a number of anti-stalking laws,
for creating malicious mischief, character assassination, and other
charges.  But the nature of the net makes it easier for these
individuals -- who are basically cowards -- to do what they do with a
relative (though shrinking) degree of impunity.

       Their behavior is pathological at best, and it was the exposure
on a daily basis to their virulent pathology, the necessity to respond
each and every day to the next new charge or rumor or lie -- which, if
unanswered, becomes assumed truth on the nets -- that in time drove me
from rastb5.  As with most Internet newsgroups, it does not have the
same safeguards against chronic abusive personalities that are present
in CIS, AOL, GEnie and other systems and BBSs across the country.

       A number of people who've gotten tired of the chronic abuse of
the system, and each other, recently resolved to try and create a new
moderated group whose purpose would be to ONLY restrict these chronic,
abusive messages from the petty dysfunctional, while allowing a) a full
range of open criticism and language, and b) not in any way affecting
or censoring the original rastb5 area.  Any group of people can agree
to come together and form a group of their own, with their own rules,
which others may or may not choose to enter. When and if that group
gets approved, many of the users who left rastb5 will sign on with this
new group, myself included.

       (I understand there's a discussion about this issue currently
going on over there, using the words censorship and nightwatch.  Which
are loaded terms designed to elicit an emotional response and muddy the
waters. Censorship is enacted against an individual against his or her
will; anyone who joins the moderated newsgroup, should it be approved,
does so knowing the charter of the group, thus expressing a willingness
to go along with that, just as anyone signing on with CIS understands
the general guidelines here.  If someone doesn't want to work under
those guidelines, they need not sign on, and hang out in the
unmoderated area.  How this relatively simple logic gets muddied is 
beyond me.)

       In any event, to your question...if any of the less than
rock-solid individuals noted three paragraphs above are asking for your
cooperation, that decision is between you and your conscience.

                                                                  jms

       Actually, casual copyright infringement has been dealt with
more and more lately; one of the reason you see precise instructions in
Kinko's Copier locations, and the reason they won't copy a full
manuscript unless you can prove you own it, is because they got hit
bigtime over the issue. It is, as you say, an area which has been dealt
with only casually, but which I suspect is going to get more attention,
particularly as the nets come more fully under the scrutiny of Suits.

       Every once in a while, I get something along these lines,
though so far usually it's enough just to tell them to please back off
a little. Their desire is usually well-meaning, just...overly
enthusiastic.  For a while, I was getting 7-8 messages a day from a few
different people, in email, asking extremely detailed background
questions, literally dozens at a time, every day.  Eventually, I had to
ask some of them to just back away and stop it.  So far they have, some
with greater grace than others.

       A related problem I have sometimes is that people will send me
email with 5, 8, or 20 questions (literally), each question requiring
an elaborate explanation to be clear.  I don't think they understand
the sheer volume of email I get on a daily basis.  If a person sends me
one or two questions I can answer fairly briefly, they'll usually get
an answer.  If it's something like this, I go into overload, and either
say "sorry" or just don't reply. If I were to engage in that kind of
detailed email correspondence, I'd a) never have time for the show, and
b) 2/3rds of the rest of my email would never get answered.  It's hard
to fault them, because it's clear that their messages spring from real
interest in the show.  I just think they don't really understand how
*much* email I get on a daily basis.  (So in general, if it's a general
question of any sort, from which others might benefit from the answer, 
*always* post it publicly instead of emailing it.  This also saves me
from having to answer the same question in email 50 times.)

       Then there was the one person I told to avoid sending me email
with 15 questions...who solved the problem by sending me 15 emails with
1 question each.....

                                                                  jms

       Just so we're clear...the problem is primarily with the mailer
set up by the Hall Brothers, who were picking, choosing and editing
threads for the express purpose of providing "ammo" to use by others in
the Let's Get B5 and JMS arena.  It's that use that had to be
addressed, and it's spilled over into the other mailers.

       The flip side is that this *is* a legitimate issue, and had to
be dealt with one way or another.  I would also rather it hadn't come
out in this way, but when the stuff is out there, it has the potential
for misuse; it was inevitable that it would *be* misused...and now it
has.  Once again, the Usual Few misuse the system and cause more grief
and emotion in a situation that could've been dealt with differently.

Subject: Comic books in U.S.?

       Let me try and address a problem I'm having with this question
and the one preceding, both of which are from folks not on CIS.  I've
just gotten a number of emails from people saying they have a problem
here, in the sense that they pay CIS for access to this forum, and the
ability to ask questions publicly.  To post a number of questions from
people not subscribers on CIS, giving them that ability, bothers some
of the users here who have to pay a subscription for that.

       Personally, for me, a question is a question regardless of
source, and thus far, I've answered all questions forwarded from other
services here. It's an awkward situation, because if this were a free
service, as rastb5moderated would be, it doesn't *matter* where the
questions come from, it's all equally free.  But I'm sort of "living"
in CIS's house while I'm here, and on a pragmatic level I have to be
considerate of the wishes of the people in whose house I'm hanging out.
Especially the wishes of the other users here.  One user put it quite
bluntly: "If they want to ask you questions on CIS, why don't they sign
up and pay the money same as I do? This isn't fair."

       So I've been debating what to do about this.  My only solution,
poor as it is, is that questions here have to originate here.  Once the
moderated group is open, which is free to all, anyone from anywhere can
ask as many questions as they choose, and this won't be an issue.  For
now, this seems the only fair solution.

       In short, I'd love to answer the forwarded questions, but I
feel I have to be responsive to the wishes of the users here.

                                                                  jms

Subject: B5 in SciFi Entertainmnt

       There are a number of actors who feel that if they're in a
story, then they should be at the *center* of the story.  Andrea seemed
to feel that if she was in an episode, the episode should be about her
character, and was consistently lobbying for this, despite the fact
that it would cut into the arc, and time for the other characters
on-screen.  Babylon 5 is an ensemble show; time on screen is determined
by the story, not by whim or personal insistence.

       Yes, we used her 8 or 9 times in a given season; but by
contract, we paid her for a full 13 episodes, whether she appeared in
them or not.  We were never under any obligation to give her *any*
guarantee; we did so to make her feel comfortable taking on the job. 
For the first year he was on the show Jeff Conaway didn't have a
guarantee of episodes; he was used as he was needed, and that grew with
time.  Andrea wanted time away from the show to do other projects; we
accommodated where we could, as we do with all our cast members, but if
a request comes in at the last moment, or conflicts with our schedule,
we can't comply.  We feel that if we're paying someone a great sum of
money to be available to us, for episodes they may not even appear in,
this is not unreasonable.

       Finally, it was never Warner Bros. who hired her or pushed her
on me. WB didn't care one way or another.  I was the one who hired her,
with Doug Netter.  If I hadn't felt she was right for the role, I
wouldn't have hired her.  But I was also under no constraint to make
the show into the Andrea Thompson Show.  Andreas and Peter have often
appeared as many times in a season as Andrea, and didn't even *have* a
guarantee for the first two seasons.  (Now they do.)

       We did what we could to accommodate her without destroying the
story arc.  I regret that she has taken out her frustrations in this
way.  Either one is a team player, part of an ensemble, or one is not. 
We are very proud of the fact that the cast members as they stand now
are all ensemble, team players.

                                                                  jms

       Let me straighten out two issues.

       On the Sinclair issue, I have never, at any time, said that the
change was for ratings.  When we decided to make that change, WB
indicated that they'd like the next person in that chair to be more
well-known.  We had no problem with that, since we were considering
Bruce at that time, as he was someone with whom both Doug Netter and
John Copeland had worked before, and were nuts about.

       Re: Pat Tallman and Lyta...after the pilot, we made an offer to
Pat for the series.  This is a matter of public record.  Pat can verify
this. (Which right there puts the lie to the statement that WB didn't
want her in the series; we *offered* her the series.  We couldn't have
made that offer if WB didn't want her there.  Pure and simple.)  What
happened thereafter was a comedy of errors, with WB playing tough-guy
with *all* the actors agents, and on the other side Pat getting some
bad advice from a manager just brought on (and subsequently let
go)...so that the deadline passed for an acceptance, and we had to move
on.  Pat has said this at cons and online many times over the last
several years, long before we ever contacted her again about doing the 
show, so there's no need to take my word for this.

                                                                  jms

       I disagree.  When even Truman was loathe to take on HUAC and
McCarthy, you've got a real problem.  You make the impact sound
minimal; but people committed suicide when their careers were ruined by
HUAC and Tailgunner Joe. I personally know writers who were at the top
of their form and their careers who never worked again because they
were blacklisted or greylisted.

       It was also the climate created by HUAC that threatened much
more widely than the actions of the committee itself.  Take Red
Channels, a sleazy little rag published by the owner of a *SUPERMARKET
CHAIN* in which he listed those he considered -- based on whim or
divine revelation -- reds or sympathetic to reds.  Even a publication
like that had tremendous destructive power.  I know one of the writers
listed in Red Channels; the networks grey-listed him instantly.  It was
*years* before he could work again.

       The whole red-baiting hysteria of the 50s came as close to
destroying the American dream as any threatened invasion.  If it had
been led by someone a little less self-destructive than McCarthy, I
hate to think what would've happened.

       Not correct.  It was first broached by me, to Michael, for

we had indicated we might do this, pending the conversation with
Michael.

       Well, the odds of a spinoff are few and far between to start
with, so it's probably a moot point.  To the other question....

       See, this is a puzzlement to me.  If I answer your question
about when and how we'll see Londo's future, that ruins the show.  This
is the puzzling part...I often get notes saying, "When are we going to
see this happen?" Well, if I were to say, "Okay, you're going to see
G'Kar lose his eye in episode 7 of year 4," then it *completely
eliminates* any surprise, any tension, any shock value to it.  I might
as well just not make the episode at that point.

       So I have an answer to your question.  And we will deal with
this point.  But to simply blow it out there would be to destroy the
impact of anything we might have in mind.

       It's funny...at conventions, actors get asked "how do you
create this character," when the characters were created by me, and I
get asked to reveal coming plot points that I *can't* reveal without
kicking the props out from under the show.  I can talk in general
terms, but anything detailed has to go by the boards.

                                                                  jms

       Yes, but equally dangerous, Phil, is blindness or self-delusion
about real failings and real problems.  Each population that marched
off to annhilation under a dictatorship did so convinced that their
values and their morals and their national fabric was supremely strong.

       Pride has a tendency to goeth before a fall.

       For additional reading check out "The Man Who Corrupted
Hadleyburg." Check out European history.  We're not a different species
over here on this side of the atlantic; we're just as capable of being
foxed as the next guy in another country.

       And your notion that the government wasn't responsible for what
happened to people during the HUAC period doesn't jibe with the truth.
It was the FBI which contacted networks and asked them for lists of
anyone considered communist; the FBI who suggested there might be
problems unless certain people were removed.  It wasn't just people
who'd attended Young Communist meetings who were targeted...it was
anyone who *knew* anyone who'd been at these things, or had in fact
NEVER been to anything like this. People were called before HUAC and
asked to *name names*, and if you didn't, then you were hiding 
something, being uncooperative, facing contempt charges, so you named
the names that had been named before, or made up new ones, gave up your
buddies or your co workers, whatever was necessary to keep from being
jailed or fired.

       The problem was worse than just "inaccuracy."  It was rooted in
meanness and cynicism.  I know someone who was asked during the second
World War to make short films for the military and the newsreels, and
to do radio shows, celebrating the US and the Soviet Union working
together to defeat the Nazis.  All well and good, right?  Well, this
same person, after the war, was grey-listed for having produced
Communist propaganda MADE AT THE REQUEST OF OUR OWN GOVERNMENT at the
time.  Meanness.  Cynicism.

       To be named before HUAC was to instantly get a file at the FBI
in your name.  As soon as that happened, you could reliably depend on
having your phone tapped, your business associates would be questioned,
your mail would be intercepted...no, the government didn't say
publicly, "don't hire this person," but when all this starts to happen,
jobs and reputations disappear. People committed suicide over the
destruction of their careers, their *lives* being torn apart.  Did
McCarthy pull the trigger?  No, but the people he targeted are just as
dead as if he did.

       There's the common assumption that one measures the decline of
a democracy in body counts and increasingly inconvenient laws and
regulations. But this is symptom, not cause.  Laws follow norms, and
norms follow values in the political food chain.  And the values of
HUAC were the values of terror, and spying on your neighbor, and
looking for the enemy beneath bedsheets.  A democracy, ANY democracy,
is based first and foremost on the notion of trust, however flawed,
that the person beside you, however different his specific beliefs may
be from your own, nonetheless hews to the same notions of liberty, and
that when push comes to shove, you will be wiling to lay down your
life to protect that person's rights.  Take that away in a paroxysm of
paranoia, distrust, conspiracies, hearings and vague accusations, and
everything else falls apart.  The center does not hold.

       To question ourselves is not to weaken our democracy, but to
strengthen it, because we know precisely what we believe and why we
believe it; we're not victims if we learn from our mistakes and thus
fail to repeat them.  If we *deny* our mistakes, or try to bury them,
or rationalize them, then we create the potential for trouble.  We are
at our most vulnerable when we are the most self-congratulatory and
assured.  Because then we get blindsided.

       "Fact is, the Red Scare tended to get two specific (and fairly
small) groups of people, Hollywood actors, writers and executives, and
people affiliated with Democratic institutions."

       Yes, and the Nazis tended to get two specific (and fairly
small) groups of people, jews and communists.  So I guess that's okay
too.

       Any attempt at repression *always* starts by first targeting
artists, writers, and intellectuals, the ones in a position to
verbalize and explain why what's happening is *wrong*.  You want to
eliminate, neutralize or destroy their credibility.  This is standard
operating procedure.  That's where it starts, but not always where it
ends.  To assume that because we've always caught it before means we
always *will* is, again, to set yourself up for a fall.

       The manipulators always go after an easily identifiable group
first, one which they can easily tar with the brush of responsibility
for society's problems.  We're seeing it again today, writ smaller, in
the constant and repeated assaults on Hollywood...attacking the
*picture* of the problem rather than the problem itself.

       Again, you demonstrate the problem.  "Well, it's just these two
small groups, really."  Then it becomes three groups.  Then four.  Or
you just stay with the two groups...and you harrass, chivvy, destroy,
terrorize, humiliate, bankrupt and ultimately lead to the death of many
of them.  But as long as it's just a couple of small groups, it's not
that bad, really.

       "Every man's death diminishes me.  So ask not for whom the bell
tolls. It tolls for thee."

       I'd also point out that when HUAC started, it was as the result
of accusations that there were commies in the Military and the
Pentagon; but when they found that they could get on TeeVee and the
Newsreels by bringing in actors...that's what they did.  What does it
do to a nation starstruck by actors to see these same shining examples
of the American dream standing before the cameras and naming names of
other actors, business associates, others?  You speak of the values of
a nation...what effect does that have on our values?  What *are* our
values if we allow this to take place...or dismiss it after the fact as
having hurt only a few people, really.

       It did great harm to the fabric of the nation, not in fines or
jail sentences, but in the *heart* of the nation, the way we look to
one another. Its effects reverberated long after the HUAC hearings
stopped.  It bred a level of paranoia that when the youth culture of
the 60s began to pop up, many of them were instantly categorized as
commies; "Go back to russia where you came from" was a common cry to
longhairs in that time.  Because to dissent was unpatriotic; the only
ones who attacked the government were the commies, end of discussion. 
The parents of kids who were teenagers in the 60s had come through
McCarthy, had learned the wrong lessons of citizenship.

       No executions?  Perhaps Julies and Ethel Rosenberg had some
part in spying, maybe they didn't, I don't know if we'll ever know for
sure.  But the Russians were working on a-bomb technology long before,
and records show that they got it pretty much on their own.  They were
executed as part of the hysteria of the times, their trial a rush to
judgment.

       No, we're not so weak a nation that McCarthy himself can
destroy it; WE destroy it, if we allow ourselves to be convinced to
turn one another in, to have the heart and soul of the nation sold out
to terror and paranoia. Every nation has within its breast the seeds of
its own destruction, within its own population; what some individuals
do is water that seed, and fertilize it.  If it grows, it grows in us. 
They don't do it to us, we do it to ourselves.  And given the right
conditions, the right environment, the right soil...we could do it. 
Even here.

                                                                  jms

> How DO you create a character like Delenn?
> How DID you create Delenn?

       As with any character I create, I tend to peel off a small
piece of myself to make the core of it.  There are certain aspects of
me scattered in all the B5 characters, Delenn in particular.  Then you
start adding elements that seem to shore up those traits.  For Delenn I
pulled in some aspects of Zen mysticism, Japanese culture, certain
Moslem influences in government and culture (minbar is the name for the
pulpit in a mosque)...next comes the layering of history, where she
came from, who her parents were, what happened to them (which, btw,
you'll hear this season)...where she was when the war started, what she
felt about it, what she did at the time, what happened later....

       Our personalities are formed in large measure by our history,
what we have seen and done and learned.  Once you have all those
details, you're a long way toward building the character.  A character
is like a well-reared child, it has aspects of its parents, but is more
than just a reflection, and forms its own life after a while.

       The final element comes in when you have an actor in the role,
and you look at the actor and the character and try to merge them, so
the truth of the person behind the name becomes the truth of the
character.  For Mira, that meant hitting those aspects of Minbari
culture which I knew would resonate with her background from the former
Yugoslavia.  I know that if I put her in the middle of a scene in which
she has to deal with her government unraveling, what the actor felt
when the real thing began to happen will seep out, whether it's wanted
or not.  Is it manipulative of the actor?  Absolutely.  Several of the
actors have come to me and noted that the character is hitting
something that's very close to them, and how did I know to hit them
with this?  Half of being a writer is observation.

       It's the same reason I assigned David Gerrold to write
"Believers," even though he couldn't at first figure out why he, mainly
noted for his light comic work, would be given this heavy dramatic
story...until he was well into it, and -- having just adopted a young
boy -- had to go through the emotional turmoil I wanted those parents
to go through.

       You have to be part oracle, part counselor, part parent, part
boss and partly mad to make this show work....

       It can be for a number of reasons.  The White Star was moving
through a highly charged atmosphere, which would leave detectable
trails; it was being fired at by the shadow vessel, which would've
attracted considerable attention from the flares; diving at that speed
and coming back up there would be considerble heat on the surface of
the ship (not normally a problem in space); and it was pretty much
shaken up/partially damaged during the fight.  Also, at that range,
once you're near enough, you can pick it up visually as it gets close;
it's not a cloaking system, only a stealth system.

       "Everybody involved in B5 is in it for the money."

       Y'know, this with some of your other comments here -- using the
old canard of dismissing anyone who disagrees with you as "worshipping"
someone who creates or does a TV show -- amounts to some of the most
cynical crap I've seen in a long time.

       Here's a little revelation for you: Before doing B5, I was a
writer producer on MURDER, SHE WROTE.  A top-ten (sometimes even top 5)
rated megahit for CBS, with extremely high visibility.  I resigned M,SW
to take on the reins of a syndicated series, which pays me HALF WHAT I
EARNED WHEN I WAS ON M,SW. Not only is my producer's fee half what it
was when I was at the network, the scripts fees are ALSO far
less...about $15,000 as compared to $24,000 for a network script.  The
residuals are lower in syndication, the publicity budget is less,
people pay less attention to you in town.

       Now...why don't you just sit down and do the math, and poke
your head out of your butt long enough to consider that maybe, MAYBE,
some people do something because they're motivated by something other
than just being in it "for the money."  If I were "in it for the
money," I would've stayed with a hit network series for major bucks. 
If I were "in it for the money" I'd be pushing for more merchandising,
I'd *NEVER* have set a ceiling of 5 years on the show, and I'd
certainly never want to get away from TV and go back to writing novels
when this is all over, since books pay a fraction of TV.

       It's truly sad to see the world through your eyes, in which no
one does anything for reasons other than THE BUCKS...no story wanting
to be told, no art, no music, no committment, nothing other than sheer,
naked greed.

       Do not mistake cynicism for open-mindedness.  Yours is just
another form of prejudice.  One can be just as close-minded by assuming
the worst of others as by (to use your term) "worshipping."

                                                                  jms

As usual, Buzz Dixon's hold on reality is tenuous at best.  He is
engaging in the same tactics that tore apart the Guild, in part because
he was one of those directly involved in the smear campaigns involving
the BBS in question.

It's ironic...a BBS is found in which messages from WGA users have
been slandered, their sexual, drug, personal and work habits not only
openly ridiculed but *catalogued* in library archive
files...constituting a de facto blacklist...and this is revealed...and
somehow by virtue of showing how a small group of people were
maintaining a system dedicated to slander, libel and character
assassination itself characterizes an attack on them is mind boggling
to say the least.

Yes, a user gave me full authorization to access a particular BBS,
where I found that members of the WGA Board of Directors, the head of
the WGA BBS and others were involved in actions against their fellow
members, outright libel, and in violation of Guild rules.  I reported
this to the Guild, which for political reasons chose to do nothing,
leaving me with no choice than to go public with this.  Because careers
of other writers were being systematically undermined.  It was the
right thing to do, and I'd do it again.

If Buzz is saying that these messages were "selectively edited," then
he is lying through his teeth, plain and simple.  The entire text, with
every single comma in place, was made available to the WGA, and if
anything had been taken out of context, all the sysops of this system
had to do was to give the WGA access to the message base to prove it. 
They never did this, and swiftly wiped out the libraries in question,
purged the message base, and quickly changed the name of the BBS
itself.  Becuase they'd been caught doing something utterly
reprehensible and indefensible...except by those people directly
involved, who're still trying to cover their butts, and smear others in
order to protect themselves.  As is being done here.  Every so often,
this thread reappears, the same BS stuff gets posted.  Ain't no big
deal.

I have not "deliberately lied about scores of other writers."  This is
an outright lie itself.  If I had done so, I would have been sued out
of business.

The majority of the other points raised are the usual distortions,
fabrications, petty lies and bigger ones, which are trotted out on a
regular basis by a very small group of dysfunctional individuals bent
on revenge because I exposed their little smear-club in front of the
whole of the WGA. The story was reported upon in the trades, in the
local press, even some national press.  And, in fact, it led to a
"writer" who was in fact NOT a writer, but a convicted felon who'd
snuck into the WGA on fake credits, being exposed and removed from the
WGA.

And yes, absolutely, several Guild members took the WGA BBS to court
because it was engaging in illegal business practices.  It issued a
User's Agreement which was against labor law, in that it restricted
message topics and discussions on the WGA BBS, which as a union house
cannot legally control or restrict information by union members on its
property.  This prior restraint was tacitly illegal, and a simple
attempt to restrict criticism of Guild officials.  So if you've got
something illegal...you take it to court.  And the court was about to
rule that it WAS illegal when the WGA abruptly dropped the UA and shut
down the BBS in a move not unlike the current situation in Utah, where
to avoid one student group existing, the state shut down ALL student
groups.  The fee asked for in the suit was to cover the expense of 
filing a suit against the Guild, which is more than $1, as Dixon well
knows. But, again, the facts aren't at issue here.

The tactics of the BBS I stumbled upon were to assemble a series of
outright lies, innuendo, misinformation, disinformation, and bile into
a collected form, which they could use at whim to discredit, harm, or
otherwise smear their fellow WGA members.  I'm not at all surprised to
see that those who were involved in that practice are still continuing
it, and that they have dragged this out into the public again.  They
got caught with their genitalia in the door, and they will never
forgive the public humiliation that came when the facts came out.

If I had done anything amiss, the Guild or other members had the right
to file charges against me.  Nothing has ever happened.  Because they
were in the wrong.  The Guild shut down its own BBS rather than allow
members speak openly about Guild policies *as required by union law*,
engaging in the kind of censorship and prior restraint which any writer
must abhor.

So now, all we have left is the sour grapes, bile and hatred from
those who got exposed.  These are sad creatures, really.  I feel great
pity for them, and do hope they seek counseling for this sometime soon.
They know that what they say isn't true; they just hope that by putting
it out there, that this will be enough to cause trouble, which is their
fondest hope.  To smear.

What actions I took in this were legally, morally and ethically
correct, and it's all very old news.  Buzz should get a life. 
Preferably one that does not involve the continued habit of his peers
of smearing other WGA members, as he does here, with half-truths,
untruths, distortions and nonsense.  This particular act has gotten
*real* old.

       A stand-alone TV movie really can't be an arc in the same sense
as a season of the show.  So I can't really consider it "a year."  A
year of story time equals one year of real time.  That's the five year
arc, which refers to the *series*, to that specific one-to-one ratio. 
The movie I've always considered to be a preface, or introduction...The
Hobbit, if you will, to The Lord of the Rings.  If it were going to a
sixth year arc, then it should've covered a span of a year; but it only
covered a few days.

       Quite true.  During the period where I was working to break in

would've been cheaper than soda, but I needed the sugar rush to get my
energy level up enough to write; with the result that by the time I
crashed at night I had the shakes from lack of food and the sudden
sugar drop.)

       Everyone told me to forget it, to take a regular job, and let
the writing wait.  But I knew that if I did this...I'd never get out. 
It was all or nothing.

       So yeah, I paid my dues.  And then some.  And if you pay your
dues, and you work hard, and you keep to your vision, and you have
something roughly resembling talent...sometimes things work out.  They
did.

       No, that comment came when I was still a reporter with the
late, lamented LA Herald Examiner, when the V series was still in
production, by one of the producers of the series.

       Every once in a while I have to put this out as an FYI, so
those of you who know the routine, stand down...the rest of
you...c'mere, Unca Straczynski wants a word with you.

       From time to time, my personal email mailbox begins to fill up
with questions that really should be asked in public forums, and which
require lengthy, in-depth explanations.  (One such today asked me to
explain, in detail, the military hierarchy of Earthforce, relative
strengths of ships, on and on and on.  In itself, not a bad
question...but asked in email, that means that I have to answer the
same thing for the next guy who asks, on and on and on.)

       I can't get into detailed, exhaustive discussions of the plot
or story or characters *in private email*.  If your question is a good
or a valid one, it should be posted in a public forum, so that others
can benefit from the answer.  Otherwise either I end up writing pages
of information over and over again, and nobody else gets the
information, or I just decline to answer the question.

       The *only* reason for using email is if it's a personal or a
confidential question, or something you don't want to say on the nets
for whatever reason.  Please help me to keep my head above water by not
using email unless there's a valid reason for it.

       If there *is* something you need to express in email, please
use the genie address (straczynski@genie.geis.com) instead of the
compuserve address, because the CIS emailbox can only hold 100 letters
at a time; any more than that which arrive get bumped and sent back or
deleted.  I lost an important piece of email regarding B5 business
today because it got shoved out by a letter asking me to explain the
differences in organization and accountability to oders between the
religious and military castes of Minbari.

       Bear in mind that with CTS, it *hurts* to type.  The more I
type, the more it hurts.  (Please don't send me any more info on CTS,
btw...I have all the available information on CTS, more than most
doctors right now, and to type a thank you note for each one that comes
in just makes the problem worse.)  If a question needs answering,
better if I can answer it once, so everyone can see it, than 15 times
for one person at a time.  Every keystroke you see from me comes with
discomfort.

       Please try and use the email address(es) only if there's a
valid reason for it; otherwise, let others benefit from the sharpness
and quality of your question by asking it publicly.

                                                                  jms

       Good news.  We've finally convinced Warner Bros./PTEN to go
with eight new episodes in a row, starting the first week of April. 
The new schedule, which just went out via fax to the stations today, is
as follows:

       So here now is the revised schedule:

       NEW EPISODES:
       2/12    EXOGENESIS
       2/19    MESSAGES FROM EARTH
       2/26    POINT OF NO RETURN              (w/Majel Barrett)

       RERUNS:
       3/4     FALL OF NIGHT
       3/11    THERE ALL THE HONOR LIES
       3/18    AND NOW FOR A WORD
       3/25    IN THE SHADOW OF Z'HA'DUM

       NEW EPISODES:
       4/1     SEVERED DREAMS
       4/8     CEREMONIES OF LIGHT AND DARK
       4/15    SIC TRANSIT VIR
       4/22    A LATE DELIVERY FROM AVALON     (w/Michael York)
       4/29    SHIP OF TEARS                   (w/Walter Koenig)
       5/6     INTERLUDES AND EXAMINATIONS
       5/13    WAR WITHOUT END: PART ONE       (w/Michael O'Hare)
       5/20    WAR WITHOUT END: PART TWO

       We're now in the process of working to get 2 new episodes in
July, so there are only 3 left for October.  Even so, we're very
excited to get a chance to show eight episodes in a row, building up to
the end of the May sweeps with our big two-parter.

                                                                  jms

       We've always done everything in our power to assist our actors
in taking outside work when they're not needed in the show.  We let
Stephen Furst out of his contract enough to do "Misery Loves Company"
for Fox, and rearranged our shooting schedule days to accommodate him;
ditto when Peter Jurasik wanted time off to do "The Late Shift," and
Andreas when he wanted to do a recent movie project.

       The key is that we need *advance word* on these things; then we
can adjust the scripts and schedules.  If someone comes to us at the
last minute, we can't do much about that.

                                                                  jms

{original post unavailable}

       I think they have the potential to become very popular, if done
right; if they're treated as novels, which means you're going to be
tied to the quality of the person telling the story.  If it's just done
as a gimmick, then arc-series won't hit it.  My sense is that since
over the next few years series may end up having shorter runs due to
the massive amount of available programming, why not build it to turn
that to an advantage?

       I need to tell this story because it won't let go.  The only
way to get rid of it is to tell it.  Because I think it may be
important.  It needs to be told because I think it has some ideas we

help reinterpret some myths at a time when we very badly need our
myths.

       I think it's fair to say that the shadow war will drag on into
at least a portion of the fourth season.

       Bear in mind that in the first season, we didn't even know the
shadows *existed* until it was almost over.  This is more than just the
story of this particular war.

       I tend to write both full-length and one-act plays, depending
on the requirements of the topic.  I've had about a dozen produced (a
mix of both lengths), and one published (and no, I won't tell you
where, because I was only 18-19 when I wrote it, and that it's still in

       I actually tend to write just about anything; I enjoy working

anthologies, articles, investigative pieces, nonfiction books, even
songs.  The one thing at which I'm *truly* awful however is poetry.

       You make those assumptions about the war dominating the show
because that's the obvious way to go, and the way most shows *would*
go.  We're many things, but obvious ain't one of them.  There's more to
it.

       But no, we don't become Vorlons at the end of the war.  They're
who and what they are because they're millions of years older than we
are; you don't just get that status in a box of Crackerjacks.

       Some elements are very traditional, and many opt for that

       The basic Ranger uniform can't be *too* specific and uniform in

But the silhouette is the cloak, the dark colors, a cowl, and the pin

       The arm broken was his right arm and wrist; we worked it into
the show, in a way which actually worked well with what went right
before it. Jerry's doing fine now.

{original post had no questions}

       No, I'm not in any way a "proud papa" or *any* kind of papa
when it comes to Hypernauts.  I had nothing more to do with it than
recommending Christy Marx as story editor and to write the pilot, and
offering a few suggestions when asked, which was rarely.  The H-team
did this entirely on their own, though certainly some of the B5
production models (meaning *how* we do things) were used to make the
show containable for television.

       A number of shows have scoped out how we've done things, and
are learning from our experience.  This can only lead to more SF TV,
which is in general a Good Thing.

       Better for B5, though, in that TNT has a lot more coverage,
more cable stations, and more PR than the SciFi channel.  More folks
will be able to hear about it and see it on TNT.  (I should mention
that TNT is *very* excited about the show, as much as we're exited to
be going there after the first run is over, and they're planning to
give it a regular time slot and a lot of publicity.)

       Yes, sorry, it's been busy, so I've only gotten a chance to
listen to one tape so far.  I'll be honest and say that while I think
it's good, it's not generally the kind of thing I tend to listen to for
very long, in that what I've heard so far doesn't seem to have a lot of
variation to it, it's very electronic, and after a while, for me, that
becomes white noise.  It's the kind of music you tend not to notice
after a while, and I like to notice my music.

       Nonetheless, you went through a great deal of effort to send it
along, and that is most definitely appreciated.  Musical tastes, like
anything else, vary widely.  I can see why many folks would like Mr.
Numan's work, and his background (in the clippings, for which I thank
you again) is most interesting.  It's just not the kind of thing that
winds my watch.

       Contacting the Vorlon government isn't the hard part; getting

that B5 and Earth were in *contact* with the Vorlons; Lyta was trying
to get inside their turf, and they aren't exactly neighborly in that

Subject: The Ensemble Look

{original post had no questions}

       Yes, I tend to agree.  Lately we've spent a lot of time on the
Narns and the Centauri from a cultural point of view, so the latter
part of this season swings a bit back in the direction of the Minbari,
allowing us to learn a little more about them, their approach to war,
relationships, their political structure and so on.

       And of course, the middle batch we've been in lately has
focused a lot on Earth, so we can deal with the whole Nightwatch/Clark
scenario before moving back into broader questions.

       I tend to write toward (for lack of a better term) musical
structure; one theme in the piece rises for a while, dominates, then
slowly diminishes for a bit while another theme comes forward...then
you have several rising all at once...interludes and
crescendos...broken here and there by the single clear note, the
non-arc story, which sustains us between the major pieces and greater
musical themes.

                                                                  jms

       Close, but there's a lot more involved in the third age than B5
or the shadows per se.

       Yes, there's a full V script -- 4 hours worth -- that I wrote
for WB, but it'll never get made; too expensive for syndication. 
(Heck, it was also too expensive for *network*...which is one reason
why we had to fight so hard to get B5 on the air.  V the series nearly
torpedoed WB television all by itself due to bugetary over-runs.)

       We end up cutting stuff out of every episode to some extent.  I
believe in writing long so you can take out any bits that don't work as
well, so only the strong stuff remains, and keep the pacing fast. 
Usually it's just line cutting within a scene, but on a few occasions
we've snipped out an entire short scene when necessary.

       Yes, if WB said there's no 5th season, period, end of
discussion, the market has gotten too glutted, it won't sustain
it...yes, the story could be collapsed into year four.  It would just
mean omitting some of the personal non-arc episodes, and some segues. 
There are basically three major movements or themes that occupy the
last two years; best is to let them play out at a reasonable pace over
two years, but it could be collapsed into one, if that were to ever
become necessary.

       But obviously that would not be my first choice.

       The Foxworth bail resulted in a change of about three lines,
that's about it.  You'll know which lines when you hear them.

       As for the next eight...one thing I'm trying to be more careful
about now is curbing my excitement about episodes.  If I say "X is the
best thing since sliced bread," there's always going to be folks who
then sit down to NOT be impressed.  Whereas if you say little, just
hide in the underbrush and let the episode whack 'em upsided the head,
you often get a better reaction.

       So I'll try to answer but in vaguer terms than usual.

       Of the next eight, I'd put 3 of them in the category of the
best we've ever done, equal to or topping "The Coming of Shadows." 
Those would be "Severed Dreams," and "War Without End," parts 1 and 2.

       You've got two personal stories in the batch, which are more
intimate and give us a break from the big changes in the current
three-part sequence. "Sic Transit Vir" and "A Late Delivery From
Avalon," that I enjoy immensely for very different reasons.  I'm very
pleased with them.

       Then you start heating up the arc again, leading toward the
"War" two parter, with "Ship of Tears" (which I think fans will like a
LOT), and "Interludes and Examinations," another very strong episode
with some real surprises.

       Personally, from a storytelling and character point of view, I
think that the "War" two parter represents possibly the very best work
we've ever done on the show, with "Severed Dreams" right behind it.

       (After the major events in "War," you get two more episodes
that act as an emotional buffer, a little quieter..."Walkabout" and
"Grey 17 Is Missing," and of the two, I think "Walkabout" is pretty
good; it has some moments that are maybe a bit too soft, which I'm
going to try and strengthen in editing this week.  The last three of
this season, "And the Rock Cried Out, No Hiding Place," "Shadow
Dancing," and the last episode, are somewhat similar in construction to
the mini-arc of "Messages," "Point" and "Severed," in that they build
thematically and contextually toward a single resolution.  There's 
a kind of nifty little visual element I use to tie them all together.)

                                                                  jms

       I don't really know enough about that show to comment; the only
reason I know as much about the V series as I do is because, when they
brought me in to write the new miniseries, I was briefed on the
situation they'd had.

       Well, to some degree you're limited by the amount of time it
takes to evolve life per se, then into intelligent life, then into
spacefaring life. You need time after the Big Bang for planets to be
formed, cool, develop environments capable of supporting life...then
the long haul begins.

       So yes, on the one hand, you've got races that are millions of
years older than humans, who were prowling around while we were still
furred, fanged, and slamming bones together.  But they're not as old as
the universe, because they can't be.

                                                                  jms

       We'd pretty much have to re-render the CGI for important shots,
while more mundane stuff where there's nothing in the upper and lower
parts of the frame could be safely cropped and lose nothing.

                                                                  jms

       We're now pretty much the province of WB syndication, a very

       No, Turhan's death was exactly as stated, natural causes.  If
it were anything else, we'd have at least nodded in that direction at
some point. It's not fair to do so otherwise.  Ditto re: any other
implanted person; there isn't one.  At least not that *I* know of.

       He would probably ask that of Kosh, if there were time, and
circumstance to think of it.  It's hard to bring that sort of thing up
unless it ties into an episode; otherwise it's just a forced sort of
thing.

       Except I don't think it's actually a story idea, but rather
qualifies as parody (of a sort).  Also, I've never said I'd go after
anybody who posts story ideas, because I can't do that; I can only
leave any forum where they come up.  I can't interfere with that. 
Actual *published* fiction that infringes is another matter entirely,
of course.

       Gerald, the reality is that as humans, we're all flawed. 
Errors and inconsistencies in something as big as a novel, written by
someone who doesn't work on the show, isn't involved in it day to day,
are gong to slip through. That is inevitable.  I try to keep track of
it all, read as much as I can, to keep it in line, but the *only* way
to keep it 100% canon is to invest all the time I currently spend doing
that on the series, which is a 24 hour a day job.

       A writer comes in, has a notion for a book, or gets one
assigned to him; the writer then goes away and around that notion
writes 100,000 words or so.  I don't see it again until the finished
manuscript comes in, almost always at the last minute.  The *only* way
to make sure that every word of that is canon is to work hand in glove
with the writer through every page. The reason the B5 series is as
consistent as it is, is because that's what I do, day in and day out.

       So the broad strokes are always going to be pretty much
consistent with the series; of the next batch, we'll probably do some
backstory in the B5 universe taken from my notes.  But some of the
details will always be off a bit, because you're turning the work over
to the hands of others.  There is simply no other way to do it short of
my adding Editor and Publisher to my list of hats.

                                                                  jms

       We'll hear more on Na'Toth this season.

       Laurel was, as stated in the series, transferred to the Rim.

       Dr. Kyle, as stated in the series, was transferred back to
Earth.

       Talia was sent back to the Psi Corps as stated in the series.

       Bureau 13 changed it's name and was absorbed into the whole Psi
Corps covert operation.  Secret organizations are constantly changing
their names. Homeguard has been absorbed into Nightwatch.

       The fate of B4 will be shown this season.

       Yes, as your stats noted, it's been pointed out to me that in
general, B5 messages outnumber the ST messages here on CIS by a factor
of 5-to-1 on most days, and in some cases, as you noted, almost 10-to-1
(the 45 for DS9 and the 451 for B5 in the same period).

       I think it's in part because, once the episode is over, that's
when the fun *really* starts as folks get into the debates and
discussions of what the episode dealt with, the quesions -- plot, moral
and ethical -- raised in the episode, the thematic and historical
elements, and so on.  The show doesn't operate in a vacuum (though the
B5 station obviously does), and it's the threads that reach into other
areas that provoke discussion.

       Which is a Very Good Thing from where I sit.

       Nothing dropped behind is ever essential; if it's essential, it
stays in, and gets paid off.  A story thread that hits a
reality-speedbump just gets modified, flows into another thread, just
like life.  You just keep on the road until you get to the end.  It's
just what the characters do.

       Fundamentally, for reasons that become clearer later this
season, I needed *a* telepath on the station, in one of several
possible positions; it's what we call in TV writing "a moveable piece."
Didn't affect things in any significant way, except to allow the return
of Lyta, which opens up a LOT of great story areas.

       Yeah, it is a lot like a novel, but as you say, once a chapter
is done, you can't go back again...so it's like writing a novel in
steel instead of paper; you can't erase what's done.  So anything you
modify has to be forward-directed, rather than backtracking.  It's
quite an elegant dance, really.  And a definite challenge, just to do
it, let alone incorporating the real-world speed bumps (an actor breaks
a limb, isn't available for some reason at an important point,
whatever).  So you have to keep the general outline in your head at all
times, and be able to shift and slide but keep on going where you're
going.

       It's two separate mechanisms; no one has been able to open a
jump point in a jump point because of the hideous amount of energy
needed by the ship in question.  They used the White Star to open a
jump point within a standing *jump gate* that was already there, and
had a secondary source of power.  The competing energies were
impossible to control, and blew the whole thing.

       What those who use ratings to bash B5 tend to forget is the
history of ST...that the original ST limped along in the ratings
basement for its three seasons, that fans of Lost in Space were
constantly bashing it as an attempt to cash in on that show (some
reviewers even noted this, in TV Guide and elsewhere), and that finally
it got dropped as a ratings failure.

       One would think that knowledge might encourage tolerance....

       Well, if you're going to look at heroic epic, sure, the
Arthurian story is a classic...but the earliest and best of these
remain the Illiad and the Odyssey.  Homer was definitely hitting all
cylinders with that.

       If there's an aspect that informed B5's development, it's the
arc of that heroic epic, which if you look at it dispassionately, is as
much about the people *around* the hero as the hero himself.  And all
too often, the hero achieves the goal, but falls or falters or is
changed by the end of it. Much of what passes for contemporary "heroic
epic" assumes that it means the Good Guys Win.  Heroic here as a term
goes back to its much earlier origins, a "heroic effort" is something
that takes everything you have, against terrible or impossible odds.

       Yes, you achieve the goal...but you fall in battle in the
fields of Troy.  Yes, you create Camelot, but in the end you are
destroyed and Camelot falls.  There's tragedy and mistakes side by side
with the glory and the gains.  The accounts of Arthur's meeting with
Mordred at Camlan field, and how the final battle began is classic
ironic drama, a tragedy of great proportions...and an aspect of that
fed directly into the development of the B5 backstory, as you'll learn
later this season.

       Histories are written about the soldiers who won their battles;
but songs are sung about the soldiers who fell in battle struggling for
a greater cause.  What inspires us is the unfinished work, the dream of
picking up the fallen standard and taking it ten more feet up the hill,
knowing that even if you fall, the next man in line will take it
another ten feet, until finally the hill is taken.  Humans are
constantly throwing their lives away on causes logic tells us are
hopeless...but which in time become real for that reason.

       It's a dangerous romance with myth, heroism, and death.  On the
one hand, it inspires an Arthur...on another, it inspires a car bomber
to blow himself and 27 bystanders to bits en route to an appointment
with Allah.

       What makes the heroic epic work is that it taps into all the
myths and archetypes that have been with us for all of recorded
history, and much of its oral history.  Where B5 gets into this area is
in trying to look at the kinds of myths and epics that have gone
before, and finding not the specifics, but the themes which are
universal, the *sense* and the feel of it, which are intangible, and
which is what makes doing an epic so hard. Either you feel the 
structure, or you don't; if you try to hammer it down into a formula,
a step-by-step process, it turns to quicksilver in your hands and slips
away. You have to take it all in, then listen to the inner voice and
write accordingly.

       I remember a stanza from a poem I read a long time ago; "Love
will die if held too tightly; love will fly if held too lightly;
lightly, tightly, how do I know, whether I'm holding or letting love
go?"  This kind of fiction operates on the same basis.  Substitute the
word epic or story for love, and the logic holds.

       So the epic hero or story can't be a *model*, to use your
phrase; it can only be an inspiration for what has gone before...an
echo in the back of your mind that whispers and guides you through all
the dark places.

                                                                  jms

       Exactly.  B5 has to be an organic process; it's a history of
the Babylon station and the people who lived there once upon a time. 
It should have the feeling of a real place, and real people.  Stuff
happens to real people.  The key is to turn it to your advantage, and
use it to make the story stronger.

       It's like trying to tapdance while people are rolling bowling
balls at you and firing burning arrows...if you can keep to the rhythm,
and even add some interesting new steps because of all the commotion,
while making it all feel perfectly natural...then you've got something.

       Exactly.  And that's the point that a few non-writers make when
they go after that aspect.  Writing is fluid...if you alter course a
little, it's usually because you found a better way to do something. 
This is done all the time, in every conceivable art form.

       Also, the B5 basic storyline was conceived by me in 1986/87; I
was a fairly good writer then, I'm better now...it's almost 10 years
later, and I've written a lot of stuff, learned more about my craft,
and the writer of 1996 has some better ideas of how to do things than
the writer of 1986.  I'd be a fool to stick to every single note from
10 years ago if I think of a better way to do it now; the goal is to
tell the story as effectively as humanly possible, not to be rigid.

people use terms like "unresolved plot lines" or "dropped threads;" the

not even that yet in what's been broadcast -- it's a little premature
to start announcing threads or plots as unresolved.  There's an ebb and
flow to the threads, they're brought in and out as needed.

       You can't reference every single thread in the show in every
episode, or you'd just have an hour of people sitting around and
reciting updates on all the various positions.

       I don't like leaving loose threads hanging around.  And I
don't.  We will hear more about Na'Toth soon, because it's time to
mention that again, as an important storyline element.  (Somebody
commented that it's being mentioned because folks have been
asking...no, I don't work that way.  It's been asked for ages now. 
People have been asking for n'grath, and I ain't moving on that one. 
The few who've tossed this my way, that because they asked they forced 
me to deal with it, are like the roosters who think their sounds at
morning are directly responsible for the sunrise.)

       In any event, to this issue...be patient.  This isn't about
immediate gratification.  There's a certain pacing in the show in the
ways in which story elements come and go, which would be more apparent
if the show were being broadcast more steadily, without breaks.  Yeah,
there've been two months almost since Lady Morella's prophecy, but
there *haven't even been any new episodes aired yet*, and it was only
aired in the last new epsiode out of the blocks, so how can it be a
dropped plotline?

       At the beginning of year one, a lot of folks were saying,
"Where's the arc?  Huh?  Where's this `overarching storyline' we've
been led to expect? Huh?  It ain't here."  Then they saw it bigtime
starting with "Sky," and eventually realized that some elements of what
they were seeing had ALREADY STARTED the arc...they just hadn't
realized it until they looked back.  "Oh, yeah...THERE it was."

       Others said, "What happened to that alien ship that blew up the
Raiders in "Signs?"  They were just thrown in there to shake things up,
and then they dropped it, I hate it when shows do that.  It's a cheat."
Oh, you mean the SHADOW VESSEL that has now formed the main core of
year three and a lot of year two?

       In this list of "unresolved plot lines" I haven't yet seen one
that we're not either dealing with, or planning to deal with shortly. 
I would suggest we perhaps table this approach until the work is done,
since only at that time can you say, positively, "THIS is an unresolved
plot line," since we've hit the resolution of the story then.  Until
then, it's an exercise in "who didn't cross the finish line?" halfway
through the marathon.

                                                                  jms

       Membership in the Grey Council is usually for life; a person
can choose to leave but only under truly extraordinary circumstances
(kind of like being appointed to the Supreme Court).  In Delenn's case,
though, remember that she didn't quit, she was booted out.

       One reason for the continuity is because you don't have a lot
of different chefs in the kitchen.  The more you divide up the
direction of the show and parcel it out, the more contradictions are
going to emerge.  Also, by virtue of having the whole story forwards
and backwards in my head, when a question gets asked about a production
element, I just sorta mentally fast-forward or backward, see how it
fits in, and can say yes, no or give a correction.  Often on shows
you've got people going and coming in the command chair, and they may
not always know the background as well as they might.

                                                                  jms

       I don't think I flamed anyone...certainly I don't think the
person to whom I was responding felt particularly flamed.  When I set
out to flame, there ain't a whole lot of ambiguity about it.  I was
stating the background to the situation firmly, and indicating the
frustration brought about by *the question*, not the person.

       I did not consider the original question a flame in my
direction, nor did I consider my response a flame in the other
direction.  If I stated the issue strongly, it's likely because I know
that any time I leave a message, it generally gets cross-posted to a
zillion other systems, so in a way it becomes "talking to the room," so
the wider audience will know the full background of the
situation...thus helping to avoid having to go into the situation in
great detail multiple times.

       If the person to whom I was "speaking" feels flamed, he should
let me know and I will apologize, as that was not my intent.  If not,
then it's a moot question.

       Yes, you've caught them exactly.

       With Ivanova, I've tried to construct a small emotional arc, in
that when she arrived, she was the new kid, she was a bit uncomfortable
with the job, and responded by being very formal, very businesslike, a
bit on the snide side.  As she's gotten more comfortable with the job,
and the people around her, she's relaxed a bit around her
co-workers...but if somebody crosses her, as Bester tends to do, she
lets fly with some pretty sharp lines.

       Kiddo, you gotta understand Da Biz, and in Da Biz, writers have
never been given the same influence or recognition as actors, and never
will. It's something you have to understand going in and accept,
because there ain't much you can do about it.

       And it's hard to fault that logically.  An actor's face is on
screen; the writer is invisible.  We all see what the actor does.  Most
folks still don't quite understand what a writer does, particularly in
TV.  Whenever I leave town, when I'm in a cab, or (less often because
fans are generally more informed) at a con, somebody'll hear what I do
and say, "So do you make up the story and the actors come up with the
dialogue?"  Some think that the TV writer puts the stuff together after
the actors and directors make the episode.

       They honestly, simply Don't Know and Don't Understand.  And you
can't take umbrage at that; it's simply the way it is.

       And whatever my participation on the nets may be, only one out
of a couple hundred people even *have* computers, and the number of
folks on the net are even smaller.  The general population still
doesn't notice this area as much as they will in a few more years.

Subject: Universes: ST vs. B5

{original post had no questions}

       Actually, the B5 budget is about half the average ST budget,
sometimes a bit less.

       We don't apply savings in CGI to alien makeup; they're totally
different areas, each with their own costs.  Whatever they cost is
what they cost.  But the reason we can do what we do is that we take
new approaches to both the EFX and the prosthetics.  Optic Nerve, who
does the prosthetics work as a contract deal, have found ways to make
their masks more lifelike, easier to apply, and faster to apply, than
the norm; so you tend to get more bang for your buck.  We've had as
many as 40 or more complete aliens -- full prosthetics and costumes --
not just in one episode, but often in one SCENE, which would kill you
in any other kind of show...unless you came up with some smarter ways
of doing things.

       That's one of the important things about B5...we don't tend to
do things the way they've always been done because they've always been
done that way.  We tend to ride the wave of technology in whichever
area we're doing, and take whatever's newest, fastest, best.

       That was ultimately the reason we went with CGI, more than any
fiscal savings.  We can *do more* with CGI, get closer, have more
ships, bigger scenes, make the B5 universe come alive.

       (BTW, a lot of folks still compare the models used on ST with
the CGI on B5, not aware that a fair amount of ST EFX now are done with
CGI; some of them have even been done by Foundation, our CGI
providers...the solar sail recently, for example.)

                                                                  jms

       Yes, we had this confirmed in Friday's Daily Variety; Viewers
for Quality Television has added B5 to its short list of qualified
endorsed shows, along with Murphy Brown, 60 Minutes, Dr. Quinn Medicine
Woman and about 10 others.  It's a definite recognition of the quality
of the show.

       It's fair to say that sooner or later, probably sooner, the

       For the most part, it's a matter of how the episodes feel to
me, what length they feel as if they require.  When I did the big three
this year -- Messages, Point and Dreams -- I hadn't really figured
they'd be as tightly connected as they ended up being.  I knew they'd
relate strongly to one another, but in a sense, they're reallly a three
parter.  The War Without End story I knew was WAY too big for one
episode, but due to the structure of the story wouldn't take being
extended for one more episode; at that point you'd just be dragging it
out.

       It's all instinct, I wish I had a more concrete answer.

                                                                  jms

       Which is exactly the point.  If you're not bothered in the
least, then it isn't an issue.  It just seemed fair and proper to
notify those who *might* have a problem with it, and some did.  It just
allows people to make informed choices.

       Yes, the push in on Delenn revealed her in the White Star, and
yes, a fair number of the new 'furies B5 inherited are Thunderbolt

       No, I kinda have to keep it all in my head.  Nobody knows the
show more than I do, so a researcher wouldn't work.  So far, in 3
years, I don't think there have been any real continuity goofs.

       No, not under normal circumstances; it'd have to undergo some
fairly extensive genetic modifications before that could happen.

       They wouldn't be fertile, no...as for impossible, the long
history of odd human sexual behavior seems to indicate that for some
folks, there ain't much that's impossible to mess about with.

       Thanks.  The easy thing to do, the TeeVee thing to do, would've
been to go from Sheridan's line "All ships return to base," to the
exterior with the big ships, and fade out.  But I try to keep this show
from doing the easy thing.  Yes, you had a victory.  Yes, it was
necessary.  But what's the cost? We shouldn't glamorize these things. 
Even at the end, as you notice, even at the end of the reception...we
go out on an ominous note.

       What part of Paterson?  The downscale part of town.
