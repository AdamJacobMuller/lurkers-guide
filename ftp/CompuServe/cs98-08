"But are there actually fully edited widescreen versions of the entire

      Yep, everything but the pilot.

      I'm starting to worry about WorldCon...this thing isn't letting
go as fast as I'd've liked.  I'll be seeing a doctor again on Monday to
let me know if I'm in any condition to go.

"Why not the pilot? Is the movie not in Widescreen available?"

      Wasn't shot that way.

"Also I read somewhere that B5 has been broadcasted in Widescreen in
Portugal, does this mean that all the SFX etc. are already available
for a Widescreen release?"

      That's correct.

                                                                  jms

"I agree the coldness was disturbing, but I feel this reveals the deep
emotion she feels at Byron's death and her consequent ruthless
determination to achieve his goals."

      This was the point I was going for with people who were saying
that the Byron thing was totally extraneous.  To get Lyta to this point
as a character -- remembering her "I'll sue" tirade as the last time
she even sorta kinda got mad -- she would *have* to go through the
fire, and lose something that meant enough to push her to this point. 
So you had to let the relationship with Byron go full term, follow it
over time, and see what it meant to her to justify and motivate what
happens to and with her in the last part of the season.

                                                                  jms

Subject: jms out of worldcon

      This is a short version of what I sent to the Internet earlier
today. In brief, as most folks hereabouts know, I got hit about a week
ago with walking pneumonia, and have been taking serious antibiotics
and other stuff to get past it, in the hope of being able to attend
WorldCon.

      A follow-up today with my doctor resulted in him saying that
even though I'm past some of the worst of it -- though weak as a kitten
 -- I'm in that perilous situation where if I push it at *all*, if I add
stress, I will almost certainly go right into acute or bacterial
pneumonia, which would result in certain bedrest or even
hospitalization.  Right now was the worst time to push it.

      So basically, I got bushwacked.  Even Harlan threatened dire
results if I even tried to board a plane.

      More than anything, I've been looking forward to this, because
as a fan, I know what it means to be a Guest of Honor at a WorldCon;
it's one of those once-in-a-lifetime things, and the perfect end to the
B5 5 year arc. But if I go, I seriously risk falling down, and if I
fall down, the company falls down, and I *can't* do that.

      So with regrets...I can't go.  The one positive light: we're
sending B5 fan club director Julie Walker (also previously the head of
the MST3K fan club) to the con, equipped with all the videotapes I
would otherwise be showing, so there will be a presence there, and
you'll see all the stuff I would have been showing.

      So there's that...but I'll confess that I'm seriously bummed
about this.

                                                                  jms

      Because we're shooting this week, the first few days on Crusade,
I'm still coming into the office, but taking it easy and not pushing
it.  The main problem was the trip and the stress of a full-blown
convention, the recirculated hotel air, shaking hands with a whole lot
of people who may have colds and the like...it was a disaster waiting
to happen under the current situation.

      At least filming is going well.

      No, it wasn't meant to be in 3D...and I don't have any plans to

      We have a bit more money...though not a lot.  We'll do things as
we always do: smart.

      It's no secret that I would've had Ivanova becoming somewhat
linked to Byron romantically (she would see him as a character like
Marcus, which is why there are certain similarities, and she would take
a chance only to find it wrong this time, underlining that she'd missed
her one major opportunity thus far for a good relationship).  This was
expressed to Claudia toward the last part of S4, so she knew at that
time that her latent ability would be coming out, and that she'd have a
big part in S5.

      In this scenario, Lyta would have become a devoted follower of
Byron's, much as she has, but it would have been more love from afar:
protective, somewhat unrequited but hoping for more...so that when he
met his fate, Lyta would end up right where she is now, just by a
different road.

                                                                  jms

      Yeah, it's just a matter of preparation and forethought; 30% of

basically zero.

      Yeah, he's correct.  Basically, B5 episodes took up the slots
from 6 through 11; nearly every episode got nominations.  Any two of
them put together would've put it atop the nominations.  They were just
too many episodes that got noms, and spread the thing out too far.

Subject: B5 at ComicCon Canceled

      I've left email for the folks at San Diego Comic Con, but
haven't yet heard back, and I want folks to have the most time to
adjust their schedules.

      As the doctor predicted, the pneumonia -- after a week of
feeling a little better -- has rebouned with a vengeance.  Going back
in today for a follow-up exam and more workups.  It's not as bad as it
would've been had I gone to WorldCon (that's what they keep telling me;
feeling as I do I have a hard time believing it because if it's true, I
can't even imagine what that would be like given what it's like *now*),
but it's laid me pretty low.

      Consequently, I won't be able to do the B5 presentation at San
Diego Comic Con on Saturday, or be there for the autographing session. 
There isn't any way to set up a replacement person and material, so
it's going to have to be canceled outright.

      SDCC is one of my two favorite conventions, that and LosCon; I
haven't missed either in something on the order of 12 years.  (If
nothing else I go to SDCC just to shop in the dealer's room for cool
Superman stuff.)  But this record has to be broken, much to my
considerable dismay.

                                                                  jms

      Just one correction: the UK fan club is a local UK group, and is
not official in any way, manner, shape or form.

      Thanks, it was fun...still a little weak around the edges, but
better.

      The kith idea came from the author, and was a perfect way of
exploring the relationships there.

      Basically, I wrote detailed outlines for all three books, and
Gregory went away and wrote the books.  Frankly, I think this first Psi
Corps novel may be the best one to date, and that's saying a lot.

                                                                  jms
