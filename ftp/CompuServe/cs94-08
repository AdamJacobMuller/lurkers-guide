Objects would fall at 1/3 normal speed in C&C.  What's the
zero-G docking area for?

BABYLON 5: EYES---ORDERS
FROM: J. MICHAEL STRACZYNSKI
RESPONSE TO: ROBERT MILLER

 Re: objects falling at one-third their normal speed...again
 I don't think this is correct.  A six pound mallet will weigh
 two pounds, and drop just as fast as a two-pound object in 1G.
 And as I recall, Gallileo dropped a wooden ball and a metal
 ball of vastly divergent weights and they both hit the ground
 from a great height at the same time.  (Gallileo?  Da Vinci?
  Why can't I ever remember these things?  I mean, five years
 of college and when I go to hook up a car battery for jumpers
 I can never remember if it's positive to positive and negative
 to negative or negative to positive and positive to negative....)

     Main goods unloaded go into the zero-g cargo bay area,
 which is above the station.

    But you really can't compare this to the moon experiments,
 because there you're dealing with one-sixth gravity, which is
 much more noticeable.

Several people tried to correct JMS' intuition re gravity. 
----------------------------
BABYLON 5: EYES---ORDERS
FROM: J MICHAEL STRACZYNSKI

     The gravity in C&C is 1/3rd G, which makes a 200 pound
 person about 66 pounds...and you're not really going to see
 any real difference; 66 pounds is a good sized child, and
 you don't generally see children floating from step to step.

     The central docking area is part of the whole station
 section that rotates, so it rotates as well.  Docking is no
 more difficult than anything else, because in space *everything*
 is in motion, there's no such thing, really, as a stationary
 object.  Even the Lunar lander was capable of docking with a
 mothership above the Moon in the 70s; we should be no less
 capable of this in 250 years.

BABYLON 5: <IVANOVA: "DAMN...">

     Of course he doesn't fit into the stereotype of an
 atheist, because the stereotype is *wrong*.

     And he is definitely an atheist.

     As for the rest...I agree regarding his cynicism and
 irreverence.  He has a tendency to say the unlikeliest
 thing at the most inappropriate moment (as you'll see
 next week).

BABYLON 5: <IVANOVA: "DAMN...">
FROM: J MICHAEL STRACZYNSKI

    "How exactly did you create so many absorbing characters?"

     In a way, I kinda took a shortcut...the kind of shortcut
that helps you make the characters more real.  I basically
peeled off aspects of my own background and divided it up among
the characters.

     I have an Eastern European background; that brings with it
a certain amount of pessimism, a somewhat sardonic humor, and a
view of life that is somewhere between resignation and
astonishment, and gave that to Ivanova.

     I was raised Catholic (though it wore off, I'm happy to
report), so I gave some of that to Sinclair, escalating it to
Jesuit training; gave him some of my fascination with history
and religion and philosophy.  I've also lost a lot of people
over the years, and gave him some of the sadness that comes
with that.

     One of the things that has constantly gotten me in deep
trouble is that I'm basically a smartass; I always mouth off
at *exactly* the wrong moment. So this went right to Garibaldi,
along with my basic atheism.

     The alien ambassadors are less personally based, since
there have to be some alien characteristics about them; a
different culture that informs who and what they are.  In
those cases I kind of backtracked from what the species was,
and tried to choose as typical a representative of that as I
could.

BABYLON 5: B5 RELIGION
FROM: J MICHAEL STRACZYNSKI

     Actually, you're distorting the issue to make your point.
To say that the atheist position that there is no god is a
belief because one must actively believe there is no god, and
thus this is now a belief system...I'm sorry, but this just
doesn't wash.

     If I say to you, "There are green penguins on the North
Pole," it is incumbent upon me to prove that point, not for
you to disprove it  You can look forever, and not find one,
and I can simply say, "Well, you didn't look in the right
places."  I said it, I must disprove it.

     If you don't buy the premise of green penguins in the
North Pole, then are you an anti-green-penguinist?  Is this
now a belief system?  If you take this to its logical
conclusion, then there are zillions of belief systems based
on non-belief in purple gazelles, Thor, talking goldfish and
the chance of the Mets ever winning the Series...all you'd
ever have time to do is not believe in something...all the time.

     The key to what you are doing is to redefine the language
to your own purposes.  But words mean what they mean, not what
you want them to mean.  A religious belief system is the belief
in a supernatural force or gods, according to the dictionary.
To say the contrary position is also a belief simply doesn't
parse logically or linguistically.

     This is really the newest (oldest) trick of the
fundamentalist aspect of the country...if religion must be kept
separate from the state, then by golly we'll cobble up an excuse
to define science as religion, atheism as religion/belief...when,
in fact, it is nothing more than linguistic smoke and mirrors.
The first rule of debate is to redefine the terms of the debate
in such a way that it favors your position; that's what this
amounts to, nothing more, nothing less.

BABYLON 5: B5 RELIGION
FROM: J MICHAEL STRACZYNSKI

    "...it seems to me that your position is one
of agnosticism.  You do not believe in a God, but
you are not ridiculing those who do."

     I think you are mistaking agnosticism for good manners.

     There is this theory propogated that all atheists are
religion haters. Not true.  I will protect the rights of a
religionist with my dying breath, because with that freedom
comes my own (though I sometimes wonder if the other side
would return the favor).

     I am not an agnostic.  I am an atheist.  My job is to
write people AS people, not try to reduce them to stereotypes
to advance some personal agenda or belief system.  If I would
perform my job as a writer honorably and honestly, I cannot
approach this sort of thing with a hateful approach. Religion
is like the little girl, who when she was good she was very very
good, but when she was bad she was horrid.  To advance the one
without the other reduces the story to propaganda.  Peoples is
peoples.

BABYLON 5: B5 RELIGION
FROM: J MICHAEL STRACZYNSKI

     Sorry, your argument falls apart on the face of it.
A negative CANNOT be proven for the reasons you cite.  So
it would be foolish to advance such a thing in the hopes
of convincing others (which is why you don't generally see
atheist missionaries).

     Look...let's say that I call you one day, and say, "Hey,
Bob, lissen, I need another hand working on B5, and I think
you've got the qualifications. Hop in your car, move all your
belongings, and when you get here, we'll work out the details
of hiring you."

     Wouldn't you want at least the minimal proof of a contract?
Or a signed letter of intent?  If you would want that much for
something as transaitory as a job, it seems to me that one would
wish for at least as much when deciding whether or not to accept
a certain cosmological perspective.

     It's not up to you to prove you *don't* have an offer, it's
up to me to prove that you *do* have an offer.

     Trying to argue a negative statement is the first sign that
the person really doesn't have a clue, or is trying to make a
false analogy (which is what you're doing, by trying to restate
my position in those terms).

BABYLON 5: MORE CONGRATS
FROM: J MICHAEL STRACZYNSKI

    It's generally acknowledged that ST:TNG got the Emmy
nomination for Best Seris this year for the reasons you

The sadness in this is not that they got the nomination and
didn't deserve it, they probably did...the truth is that they
probably deserved it *some time ago*...have probably deserved
it for a long time now.

     But finally one SF series has cracked that particular nut,
even if it took seven years to do it, so my hope is that perhaps
we might get the nod at some point before our 5 years are up.
Still, with the bias against SF within the Academy, who can tell?

BABYLON 5: B5 CAST ANNOUNCEMENT!
FROM: J MICHAEL STRACZYNSKI
TO: ALL

                         **** Announcement ****

     Since this has just been released by PTEN, and will be 
on the news wires shortly (and is probably already there), 
I can now announce this here.

     The new Commanding Officer for Babylon 5 is Captain John
Sheridan, former captain of the Earthforce military starship 
Agamemmnon.  It was Sheridan who won what is arguably Earth's 
only real victory during the Earth/Minbari War, destroying the
Minbari war cruiser Black Star and several accompanying 
vessels.  He has been appointed to Babylon 5 over the strenuous
objections of the Minbari Government, by the president's 
insistence that Babylon 5 has had too much influence from the 
Minbari and must begin to pull back and consider Earth's 
interests; Sheridan is a symbol of that desire because of his
record, which is the reason for his assignment.

     Captain Sheridan will be portrayed by the well-regarded 
actor Bruce Boxleitner, known to many as the series lead in 
"Scarecrow And Mrs. King."  He has also starred in numerous 
TV movies, miniseries and feature films.  He is also a solid 
SF fan (media *and* print), and is very excited about coming 
onto the Babylon 5 team.  We're equally excited to have him.

     (Those here who've heard rumors about this building, and 
were kind enough to refrain from repeating them here at my 
request, can now speak, and I thank you again for your 
Cooperation.)

    Sheridan is a soldier.  A soldier is told, in wartime,
THIS is your enemy.  You kill the enemy or your enemy kills

were in after the end of WW II when it came time to reconcile
with the Germans and the Japanese.  It can sometimes be very
awkward...and sometimes reconciliation takes a while.

     And you're right about the situation providing some

Minbari don't much like him).

     The main reason for the Lt. Cmdr. distinction in most

But we have some different ideas in mind for year two.

     And it's Joe.

FROM: J MICHAEL STRACZYNSKI
DATE: MON, AUG 8, 1994, 1:00:14 AM

     What does a casting decision have to do with changing the
story of a show you find "so far cerebral and provoking?"

     You note Boxleitner as "some pretty boy space cowboy,"
which may (or may not) describe some of the roles he may have
played, but a) he's played other kinds of roles, and b) that
isn't the kind of role that he's going to be playing on B5.
What you are doing, really, is discriminating against someone
because he may look good.  Bear in mind that many women comment
on the notion that Sinclair was attractive.  So if you're 
swapping attractive for attractive, I don't see the difference.

     "Give the braindead what they want."  To which braindead
do you refer here?  Because it was, fundamentally, my
decision -- based on the story and what was going on for year
two -- to bring this notion to Michael O'Hare, who supported it.

     I understand that you like the show, and I appreciate that;
what I'm trying to do is to get you out of speaking in cliches
that have nothing whatsoever to do with the situation.

     The story is the story is the story.  That isn't changing.
Nor is Sinclair gone forever.  We have, as I've repeatedly noted,
already filmed one lengthy sequence with the character to show up
later this season.  The changeover in command of the Babylon 5 
station will broaden out the story and let us do more stuff.
And the stories for next season that we have on hand now are even
more ambitious, and more complex, than those seen this season.
Our second episode, "Revelations," is easily on a par with
"Chrysalis," our big cliffhanger for year one.

     Science Fiction is, in part, about approaching the future
with an open mind.  (And Boxleitner, btw, is a *major* SF fan,
not just of the media stuff, but the novels as well, and is a
voluminous reader.)  Some of the people most upset over Sinclair
leaving are the same ones who first said to throw him overboard
based on the pilot.  "Give him a chance," I said, "he'll grow on
you."  He did.  Now you and a few others are throwing Bruce
overboard based on your perception of his prior work.  To which
I say again, "Give him a chance, he'll grow on you."

     On the one hand...we have more interior sets than any other
series that I know of; 18 standing sets and 42 swing sets.  And
we're building a number of other sets for next year, including
an Officer's Club.  In addition to C&C, we've seen various holding
cells, numerous quarters, a conference room, Sinclair's briefing
room, the Council Chambers, the business room, two separate
restaurants, the Zocalo, the Dark Star Club, the Casino, the Happy
Daze Bar, Doug's Dugout Sports Bar, the Ombuds Courtroom, various
DownBelow sectors...we've shown a *lot*.

     Re: the crops/parkland...no, there are no settlements there.
You don't waste precious land needed for farming and oxygen 
reclamation and hydroponic gardens to throw up a shack or house.
Those who work in the central Garden area live in standard B5
quarters.  There are some recreational areas, a hedge maze (as
you'll see later this season), and we're adjusting some of our sets
to reveal more of the garden area.  No one "camps out" on the
surface; if they try, they're destroying precious crops, and are
arrested.

BABYLON 5: RANKS IN B5 (#785277)
FROM: J MICHAEL STRACZYNSKI
DATE: SUN, AUG 7, 1994, 11:29:02 PM

     A captain (as in the two-parter) is not subordinate to
Sinclair, but B5 is Sinclair's command, and the captain must
defer while on that base of command (as Sinclair must defer
to Major Krantz in another episode where he is on that person's
station).  Overall, the ranks have been fairly consistent,
insofar as I can tell.

     We hadn't finished negotiating with Bruce,

Now, the scary thing is, were you paying THAT much
attention to STARLURCH?

Although the really scary thing is that if I saw it
now, given the crudola that's on - Deep Space,
Babbling Five, and so forth, I might say, now THERE is real SF.

Oog.

Speaking of oog - our agent called and said they're reviving
OUTER LIMITS, and the people there were interested in us doing
a script for them - one of the producers was a big fan of our
stuff on WEREWOLF. We said maybe (not wanting to do ANY more TV,
and so they sent us the bible. Org, as Albert Alligator used to
say - each and every line in the Writer's Guide was another stake
in the coffin - good gets rewarded, evil punished, they're gonna
do the moral at the end of each episode, and so on and so forth.
I'd forgotten, until I looked it up, just what a hound-doggie
OUTER LIMITS was. The new one is gonna be on Showtime - wanna bet
it's gonna make the old one look scintillating?

Oh yeah - we sent them some ideas, but they had every swingin' one
of them in development. Including one called VIRTUAL MARILYN (Monroe).
Suuuuuuuuure they did.

     "JMS has specifically told us that one MAIN

Departure (I don't remember which)."

     No I haven't.

     Never said it.

     Sometimes, what happens is that people guess
about what's going to happen in the story...and
gradually that becomes the assumption on the part
of some people that this WILL happen...which in
time metamorphoses into "JMS said this would happen."

     This is yet another of those.  Never said it.

     While I understand how this happens (and it
happens a lot), the only real complication that I get
from it is that suddenly I'm being held to promises
I never made...and if it doesn't happen as I
supposedly said, then it's somehow my fault.

     I'm led to understand that videotapes of B5 will
be out sometime around the Fall or so, from first
season.  There will eventually be laserdisks, and the
best part of *that* is that they'll be in the original
letterbox format in which the show is actually filmed.

     In fact, in preparation for that, we've begun the
process of transferring the videotape CGI effects to film,
in correct aspect ratio to match the original live-action
film.  As we finish, this will all have to be
quality-controlled, so though it's a burden, I've
volunteered to get the first set of widescreen tapes so
that I can screen them prior to final transfer to disk.

BABYLON 5: JUNE LOCKHART EPISODE (THE QUALITY OF MERCY)
DATE: SUN AUG 21, 1994 5:47:19 PM (#798475)

     To your first question...yes, I was involved with
the animated series "The Real Ghostbusters," as story
editor for the first syndicated season and the first
network season (basically story editing 78 episodes in
the same season), and over all wrote about 20 or so
episodes.  It was a great deal of fun, but the best part
is that the show continues to be very popular.

     As for the ending of "Quality," which you describe
as "vulgar, unnecessary and uncalled for"...the only
thing that I can do is disagree. While you are free to
describe it in any terms you wish, and I cannot contest
that part of it, since a subjective reaction is just
that...it is not within the purview of any viewer, or
reader, to decide that something is or is not necessary
and called for within the province of a story.  That is
the writer's responsibility.  You may not like it.  That's
your province. So I would separate out those two issues.

     Secondarily, it was handled with infinite discretion.
At NO POINT was anything put verbally.  At no point was it
even linked to sex.  It was *very* carefully written so
that unless you're really paying attention, you won't get
it.  Certainly young kids won't get it.  It's implied only
very, very tangentially.  My show is for adults.  I write
for adults.  If you want to see vulgar, turn on "Absolutely
Fabulous" on Comedy Channel...which is also one of the
funniest shows around.

     Anyway, I'm sorry you didn't like that aspect.  You
are the first person to express that opinion, but that in
no way invalidates it.  I just don't agree with it.

DATE: MON AUG 22, 1994 1:21:04 AM

     There are actually many issues to get into in all of
this.  Which is really the "person," the mind, the soul,
or the body?  If a person has an accident, getting amnesia,
which wipes out his entire personality, is that person as
good as dead?  Is there no difference between amnesia and
death? If not, why not just kill the amnesiac?  But
obviously there *is* a difference.  So what is the person?
What constitutes death?

     We consider the actual death of the *brain* through the
cessation of brain activity to be the test for death.  But
what if you simply rearrange those patterns?

     There is also the question of *justice*.  If the person
is dead, then that person cannot do much to correct the ills
he visited upon society.  It is simply a waste of material.
So why not take someone who, in any decent society, would be
executed or forced to live in a 6x9 cage the rest of his life,
and give the soul, and the body, a new chance by giving the
person a new personality and letting him, as the Ombuds says,
"serve the community harmed by his actions"?

     Finally, if the person is dead, he's dead; let's say 5
years down the road somebody finds evidence that proves the
person was innocent.  There is at least the *chance* to
reconstruct some of the original memories and personality
profile.

     All of this, again, has to be considered in light of the
fact that we are talking about a *space station* with limited
space and resources.  You cannot warehouse every person who
kill somebody in a station that small; you would run out of
space almost immediately.  (If you also include basic felons
and near-killings.)  So what *do* you do with them?  As was
noted, Earth doesn't want them and won't pay to have them
shipped back...what's left?

     That's the dilemma I wanted to pose in the episode...what
*can* you do?

be punished for a crime that 'personality' did not
commit."

     1) But again, which is the person...the old
        personality, the new one, or something else?

     2) Part of the new personality would be the delight
        in serving others.

     The theory is as yet only a theory; and if proven
true, still wouldn't cover all cases.  If true, those
cases where that could be shown that was the cause would
receive different treatment.

     My involvement is *total* with every single aspect of B5.

     Once the script is written, I work directlly with the
costume designers, prop designers, art director, director,
computer graphics designers, every department.  I'm in on
every phase of pre-production.  All design elements must get
approval through my office.

     I'm directly involved in casting sessions, with final
approval (along with Doug Netter) of who's cast in our
episodes.  I have meetings with the director and others to
set the tone of the episodes.

     I'm on set during filming, working with the director as
much as I can, given that I'm simultaneously working on the
next few episodes.  Generally, though, once the script hits
the stage floor, it's virtually never changed (and then only
after checking with me or Larry), and the directors know what
they're doing well enough to leave them alone.  (Hire good
people and get out of their face.)

     When the director finishes his or her cut of the episode,
John Copeland and I take over and do the producer's cut, in
some cases totally re-editing episodes (though the better the
director, the less of this we need to do). After the producer's
cut is made, I work directly with John, Chris Franke, and our
sound design people on the sound effects, music, walla and
other elements that go into the show.

     Finally, I'm there at the end audio mix, where it all
comes together.

     I can't "leave this kind of stuff up to the directors"
because for starters, directors don't do a lot of this stuff.
Also, directors come and go and may not have the vision of
the series in its totality.  Further, TV is primarily a
producer/writer's medium, whereas film is a director's
medium.  This is my vision of the show, and I have to be
there at every stage to make sure it *remains* my vision.

     So on one level...my fingerprints are all over the show,
on every square inch, at every level.  On another level...one
can only do this if you've got a terrific crew, cast and
production team who know their stuff and make this an easy
and painless process.  They're bright, have vast amounts of
initiative, and are fun to work with.

BABYLON 5: NEW JMS PROJECTS (#800954)
DATE: WED AUG 24, 1994 3:04:29
TO: ALL

       Since this just hit the wire services, I figured
I'd mention it here.

     The release went out from Classics International,
owner of First Comics.  A deal has been concluded between
CIE and Rattlesnake Prods. (owned by my partner on Babylon 5
Doug Netter) to form a separate entity to produce a feature
film based on the Grimjack books by John Ostrander.

     The movie is budgeted for $30 million, and I've been
asked, and have agreed, to write the screenplay.  (My job,
as I see it, is to Leave The Damned Thing Alone and *adapt*
the book, rather than throw stuff out and make it all up.
I loved the book when it was out, and read it regularly.
My hope is to do as faithful a transition to film as
possible.  I've met with John Ostrander, and our feelings
on which cycle of the Grimjack story to base the feature
film on are absolutely the same.)

     The plan is to have the script finished by late fall,
probably around November/December, and shoot the thing in
early or mid-1995.

     (In addition, this Fall we're currently slated to
begin production on a two-hour pilot for a new contemporary
science fiction series which I've created and written for
first-run syndication.  Current plans are to film the pilot
in either Vancouver or Portland, with Doug and I serving
again as Executive Producers, as with Babylon 5.  I can't
reveal the title at this time -- it's nothing you'd
recognize, it's an original concept, but it's a cool title
and I'd hate to lose it -- but I hope to have more on this
over the next few months.  Also, there are still one or two
more hurdles before we can start production, even though
we've been unofficially greenlighted, so I'll hold back
just a bit for now until the ink dries officially.)

     My basic problem is that unless I'm writing all the
time, I get twitchy.  If I have some down time, as we did
between seasons one and two, and we don't know if there's
going to be a second season or not so there's nothing to do
on B5 during that time (aside from post production and
editing, which isn't really writing), I have to find
*something* to do with words beside BBSing...so I sell a
series concept (with Doug) to a studio and write a pilot.
What can I say?  I'm an obsessive-compulsive personality.

QUESTION: <hoping new work doesn't interfere with B5 script creation>
====================================================================
DATE: WED AUG 24, 1994 9:41:16 (#801677)

     No, no problem.  The pilot script is already finished,
having been written during our (alleged) hiatus.  The
screenplay won't be a problem. Should the pilot go to series,
while I'll be exec producing the series, it will be at some
slight remove, because my first day-to-day allegiance has to
be B5.  In the case of the other series, there will have to be
an experienced writer/producer/show-runner brought on board to
work directly with me and Doug...someone who also knows SF, with
enough credits to guarantee the best show conceivable.

     No, the structure we're discussing *is* the B5
structure; the structure of the new series, should
it go from the pilot, would be far more episodic. One
major saga at a time is *more* than enough for me.

     Valen, Zathras...these are all things I'd rather let

     Garibaldi is head of security, and Franklin would
likely give him the report, which Garibaldi then relays.
In such things there is a chain of command.  And as you
say, it seemed pointless to bring in the actor just for
one half-page scene.

QUESTION:  insert grumbling about lack of civil rights in QoM here
==================================================================
DATE: THURS AUG 18, 1994 10:13:27 PM (#795897)

     Allow me to disagree with you.

     Dr. Franklin did not require a search warrant to enter
Rosen s quarters.  The door was basically open, and he is NOT
an officer of the law. Only officers of the law are required
to have search warrants.  Neither was he there to arrest her.

     Defense counsel was sitting with the defendant at the
table.  He had no lines, but he was there.  The trial had
been ongoing; this was the part where the verdict is rendered
after a decision has been reached.

     The pattern of the judge passing sentence is exactly the
same as when circuit court judges used to work the frontier
areas of the US.  Where would you find a jury on B5?  Most
civilians are passing through, on stop-over for only a day or
two...unable to follow a long hearing.  The only other ones
are station personnel, which represents a conflict of interest.
Your only choice is a circuit court style judge whose loyalty
is owed to no one.

     The alien device was being used on humans without any
kind of license, she is not a certified doctor, and it was
used in the death of a human. Under those circumstances, it
is within the judge s right to confiscate the device for the
greater good.  (You can have a unlicensed firearm in a state
that requires licensing, and use it in a righteous self-defense
shooting, but it will be confiscated afterward.  No compensation
is required because its use is/was unregulated, unlicensed, and
she was/is not a working doctor.)

     It *is* due process.  Even according to 20th century terms.
Only problem is in understanding what due process actually *is*,
as opposed to what we think it *should* be.

     No, it wasn't convenience for the story line, if this
were a real case it would be confiscated as part of that
case.  It wouldn't have to be dealt with separately.
