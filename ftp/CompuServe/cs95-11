     So, in other words, if a historical, real character has been used in 
some other venue, if the use of that same character in another, 
wholly different world/series/show/universe is absolutely, totally and 
completely the right thing for that story, 
one should instead do what's *wrong* for the story and leave it out?

     Sorry.  Don't buy it.

     No, it was very much intentional; Sebastian learns quite a bit in the

     Sacrificing oneself happens frequently...but for just one other 
person, AND in a situation where no one else would ever know about it.  
Bear in mind that he wasn't testing people randomly; only those who felt 
that they were chosen of god, fulfillers of prophecy...people who assumed 
that they were part of some grand scheme, and thus to whom an anonymous
death is an intolerable thought.

     Also, most probably never *got* that far, unable to stand the real 
pain of being placed in this position.  Everybody can talk the talk; very
few can walk the walk.  Most probably just yanked off the bracelets and
split, on the theory that they weren't being sufficiently coddled or
glorified...or because being a potential prophet isn't as much fun as
they'd thought.

      "It doesn't fit in with the way the Vorlons have been portrayed.  It 
bothered me."

      Good.  That was the intended result.

      Part of the reason for the story was to grey up the Vorlons a little; 
one shouldn't fall too easily for what other people *say* they are.

      (One might also say much the same of the old testament god who would 
have Job so severely tested, btw.)

       One should always be cautious of taking *anyone* at face value on B5.

     Re: "tennis wrists," or carpal tunnel syndrome...yes, I've got it in 
spades.  I have to use the CTS gloves constantly or the arms ache badly
within a matter of minutes; and even then they only slow down the speed
with which they begin to hurt.  As it is, there's a dull ache pretty much
all day, and most of the night; and after enough writing, my ring fingers
on either hand start curling in, and my forefingers get a bit numb.  
Toward the end of last season, the only way I could write was to write for 
30 minutes, ice down my arms for 10 minutes, write for 30, ice for 10, and 
so on.

     No matter what precautions you take, when you write sometimes as much 
as 20 pages per day...it's gonna happen.

     (General note: I've seen virtually every article on CTS, I know about 
the vitamins, the wrist-rests, the exercises, all that; I do what I can
with those things that help.  So while advice is appreciated, it's not
necessary in this case.)

     From a strictly logical standpoint, a president would not lower 
himself to deal with this personally.  When MacArthur and Patton earned
the disfavor of the president, it was intermediaries who pulled them aside
and registered this.  Also, gradually more authority if being vested in
Nightwatch and the Ministry of Peace, as that's his arm, and so he'd be
inclined to use that since he's in most direct control.  (Just to explain
why what was done was done.)

     Re: the starfury drop...this has come up before, and some of the 
better high-IQ types have said we got it right.  The fighters use
centrifugal force to be propelled *away* from the station; yes, it's at
a slight tangent, but the station is also rotating behind them, so it
isn't that severe.  The furies don't actually fire their engines until
they're a bit away from the station, using the force of the drop.

     The vectors actually work out accurately.

     "it just didn't pay off in the long run."  For you.  For others it 
did. Let's not start getting grandiose.  You feel this way, that's fine,
but it's not the ultimate truth.  Otherwise you're totally dismissing the
opinions of others who liked it a lot.

     "Jack...has become a real cliche."  So because others have used that 
figure in their work, well or poorly, no one should ever use this 
historical figure ever again in the next thousand years of human history.  
One should not do what one thinks is right for a story because of what 
someone else did in a different story.

     Sorry.  I don't work that way.  By your logic, I should not be using 
starships or hyperspace or aliens, either, because they've been used a LOT 
more than Jack.

     Well, I have a number of feelings about this.  First, you'll note that 
it's always an alien that has something "different" than the ST normal male 
or female character...we had the aliens who were all unisexual in TNG, now 
this.  And, of course, it wasn't *really* two women falling in love, it was 
someone who was once a male, now in a female body, carrying on with that 
relationship.  So there are a lot of ways out of this.

     I also think they somewhat played it for the prurient interest factor; 
we just did it, by developing a relationship over time, and when it came to 
fruition, we didn't make a big deal about it, it's just normal and 
accepted. And it was between two *human* characters.  It's personal taste,
I suppose; I just prefered it the way we did it.  Doesn't make it better or
righter.

     We developed a growing relationship between Talia and Ivanova over two 
whole seasons; paid it off, and there will be ramifications down the road 
from this relationship.  Because it *is* a relationship in that sense, not
just done for one hour, for sensationalism, and then you drop it thereafter.

     The thing about the Kinesis is that for the first week I was using it,

I looked in the manual, and found it said approximately "For the first week 
your wrists and arms will hurt."  Oh.  Then you get used to it.

     Overall, I've gotten quite proficient with it, and the typing speed 
hasn't diminished.  There are a few things that could've been done better,

     Yes, the Shadows know that the Vorlons are still around, and that Kosh 
is there.  That's never been any kind of secret.  They're just hoping that 
the Vorlons and anyone who might believe them won't find out that they're

     I think I wasn't clear...the Lennier/Kosh scene *was* filmed; it just 
didn't make it into the final cut of the episode.

     In general, we leave 2-3 minutes per episode on the cutting room 
floor, for various reasons...pacing, structure, whatever.  Usually it's
just line cutting, sometimes it's a small, quick scene here and there.

     Yeah, this is the other structure that's kind of a favorite of mine.  
I used it also in "Coming of Shadows."  It starts out kind of slow, it
lulls you into a sense that this is going to be a fairly ordinary story,
nothing major...allowing me to sneak up behind you in the story and just
*whack* you real hard when you're not expecting it.

Nightwatch, the emphasis on revealing spies in our midst, enemies of the

     The problem with pointing to the Nazis or the Gestapo exclusively is 
that it allows us the safety of saying, "Well, it happened just there, and

     "Good is the absence of evil...."

     Is it?  Is it the *absence* or the *opposite*?

     One might say (to take a christian pov for a moment) that god is the
absence of evil.  But is this the case?  Is evil a thing, or is evil the
potentiality to do acts of wanton destruction?

     At what point did evil come into the universe, from this pov?  With the
fall of Lucifer?  But unless the *potential* for evil existed before this
act of pride, it would be impossible for Lucifer to fall.  The very tenet of
free will is that there are choices to be made.  If there are no choices,
there is no free will, quid pro quo.  Hence, in the garden, the *potential*
for evil existed before an *act* later described as evil or rebellious.

     And, hence, the *potential* for evil existed before Lucifer fell.  If
it had not, he couldn't have fallen.  (Also, if one takes the position that
the fall *created* evil, then a fallen angel has creative potential, which
puts it at an unacceptably high level of power.)

     It says in the book of Amos, "Is there evil in a city and the Lord hath
not done it?"

     If the potential for evil was there from the dawn of creation -- and it
*must* have been for the actions described later to have taken place -- then
there must perforce be the potential for evil in its creator.  (Unless one
is willing to posit that in not having the potential for evil, god does not
have free will, which means god is not omnipotent, and somehow gifted his
creations with a capacity he himself was incapable of.) This doesn't mean,
and shouldn't be taken to imply, that god *is* evil, or *has* evil, but
rather that the *potential* is there, and has always existed.

     Thus, good is not the *absence* of evil, but the *opposition* to evil.
To use Mark Twain's example in "The Man Who Corrupted Hadleyburg," you had
an entire town that had never known temptation, and held itself up as
righteous...  until the first day when real temptation walked in the front
door, and the whole place fell for it...after which the sign out front of
the town was modified to read "Lead us INTO temptation," for only through
temptation, through the exposure to evil, is faith and the good tested and
made viable.

     Incorrect.  Share *is* important on the local level.  When you get the
national ratings on a syndicated program, the final figure doesn't have a
share, only a rating.  Shares come in market by market, and since the show's
future is determined market by market, that's crucial to our survival.  So for
our purposes, the share per market is *very much* the more important figure.

                                                                       jms

     Some stations are shifting to less terrific timeslots; other stations are
giving us *better* timeslots.  There's no one trend.  The main problem is that
each market only has maybe one or two indie stations max, and if that's a Fox
or UPN station, you've only got 2 prime time hours per night available 8-10
(nearly all of these show their news programs at 10 p.m.). So first precedence
for those 14 hours per week is given to Fox or UPN programs (or WB programs,
depending), plus all the other syndicated shows out there, from talk shows to
game shows and so on.

     The market for syndicated shows, and where you can squeeze them in, is
getting increasingly smaller.  Hence the growth of cable.

      I dunno...I just kinda figured that invading Poland, invading the
Sudetenland, invading France, invading Russia, bombing Britain, eradicating
much of the population of jews and gypsies in Eastern Europe, that kind of
stuff comes as close as I can think of to a definition of a human monster.

      Granted he fixed the economy, got Germany on a solid economic footing,
ran a tightly organized Olympics, instituted new fashion sensibilities, and
created some interesting architectural structures...and you couldn't beat his
sense of theater and high drama...but I kinda think the former somewhat
outweighs the latter.

      Perhaps we are working from different definitions of what a monster is.

      There can be no question that the conditions prevalent in Germany after
WW I created the climate in which a Hitler could come into power. There was
great resentment and anger festering over the onerous conditions placed upon
the German government, the enconomy was in ruins, people were looking for
someone to blame, and that creates the perfect condition for scapegoats, and
someone who can take advantage of that.

      Hitler, however, was able to perceive that, galvanize it, shape it and
form it.  It was Hitler who organized the brownshirts and created the
krystalnachts, who orchestrated his rise within the government until he was
finally able to seize the reins of government, and he who was the primary
architect of the atrocities of that period.

     Of course he didn't do it by himself; there were those who willingly, even
happily collaborated; those who opposed and said nothing; those who were of no
opinion one way or another; and those who resisted.  If you're going to blame
the first group, maybe the first two or three, you still have to recognize the
fourth.

     People can be driven by the madness of the crowd, or intimidated by the
government of the gun into silence.  No one is looking to totally exonerate the
citizenry; though one can make a compelling argument that anyone who spoke out

was swiftly arrested, deported, or shot...which tends to discourage the free
exchange of criticism.  Would WW 2 have taken place without Hitler?  Possibly;
the conditions were right.  Would it have taken the same shape?  Probably not;
almost certainly not.  Thus the blame for *this* war, the way it happened
*this* time, must be laid at his feet.

                                                                       jms

     "...that would mean that it would be near the bottom of the ratings of
syndicated shows."

     People who don't know what they're talking about should avoid making
comments like that.  The overall breakdown of syndicated shows runs about 10
pages of very fine type; usually around 215 shows or more, ranked in order of
average national ratings.  Babylon 5 is always on the first page of that
breakdown; usually the #4 or #5 dramatic series for that week, sometimes a bit
higher, never less than #6.  We consistently stay in the top ten of dramatic
series.  (You don't include game shows or talk shows in the mix; that's
comparing apples and oranges.)

      If you *include* all those other shows, in one typical week, we came out
as #38 overall, out of 215.  That is extremely respectable.  Most network shows
that come in around the top 50 tend to stay around for a good long time.

     Look, Peter, do me a favor, and get off the ratings, okay?  It's clear you
don't understand them, and the bottom line is simply this: if our ratings
weren't sufficiently high, we wouldn't be here.  It's that simple. We're here,
so we're getting the numbers.  Warners is happy, and we're happy.

                                                                       jms

     Because Delenn doesn't know that information offhand, any more than you or
I would have casual access to detailed scientific information from our own
world just off the top of our heads; she'd still have to go to her own
homeworld for the info, as our characters did.  And it's not that we didn't
have it, it was just collating it all.  And given how Kosh answers questions,
would you really want to use his responses in this thing?

                                                                       jms

      My sense is that Delenn is not a godlike font of information; I don't
think anyone, alien or human, at the station would just happen to know all the
information required.  How much would Delenn know about molecular biology, for
instance?  (And if you asked Kosh a question about the subject, he'd probably
come back with "The heart does not sing with its parts."  Not exactly useful.)

     Anyone there would have to go back to their own world for experts in the
various fields...so you're back where you started.  Earth *has* the info, it's
just getting it, and getting it fast.  If you add the overlay of going through
another government, you're going to run out of time that much faster.

     Logically, a probe like this would be sent off looking for information on
the very cusp of technology that could pose a threat.  That's why it *didn't*
go off when the probe presumed them to be a less developed civilization; it was
looking for civilizations that *are* sufficiently advanced to pose a possible
threat; Sheridan says exactly that as he walks across C&C.

     Interesting aside on this, btw, in the "where do you get your ideas?"
department.  The US House Science Sub-Committee held a series of hearings into
the question of extraterrestrial contact during the 1970s, to determine what we
should do in the event of contact.  The most likely scenario, the scientists
agreed, was a probe coming into our solar system.  So what do we do in response
to a message asking if anybody's home?

     Believe it or not, it was the consensus of the Subcommittee that we should
not respond...in case it was a berserker, just as shown in the episode.  That
is our government's official policy on the subject.

                                                                       jms

nothing major until after we're done.  Then, when it can't contaminate the

       Talia and Ivanova were linked/did have a relationship; and there was a
camera edit that didn't quite match, two different issues.

       A book after the fact...will have to wait until I'm done for a decision.
We hope the show will in time be out on tape/disk, and all of the major
questions raised during the show should/must be answered during the show, you
can't leave stuff hanging.

      Had a Minbari been running that sensor, he would've nailed it instantly;
but Ivanova had never actually encountered that ship before, and was running
off the initial scan reports.  (Also it was just phasing in at that point.)

      The White Star uses local drive engines based on magnetic and
gravitational principles; in a sense, it doesn't so much push itself toward
other worlds as *pull* itself or *repel* itself.  One side effect of creating a
powerful gravitational system is the ability to create artificial gravity.

pretty hideous (though not as bad as "Messages"), so I moved "Gethsemane" into
that slot, which is a very strong episode, though not an arc'er.

      2) On the story question...yes, this was the story that someone else
(don't want to use names, no sense in blaming anyone) had accidentally
suggested while I was working on it early in season two.  So I had to scuttle
the script for nearly a year.  Finally, very chagrined over what happened, the
individual gave me a notarized form explaining the situation. At that point, I
was able to reactivate the story.  So no, it's not any kind of "it's okay to do
this" notion about story ideas; as it is, the story was tied up for about a
year, and might never have seen the light of day had not the other person made
great efforts to set the situation straight.

      I just went through my stuff trying to find it...there was a formal
report published by the Government Printing Agency in around 1978 or so.  I
think it was entitled something like "Prospects for Contact by Extra-
Terrestrial Intelligence," and went into the whole CETI issue at great length.
(Back then, it was CETI, for Contact With Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence,
changed shortly after the House hearing on the subject to SETI, Search For
Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence.)  Any GPA office should have the report on
file.

      Of course it's your right to say it.  You can say any foolish thing you
choose.  My point -- underlined by your own comments -- is that you have
absolutely no understanding of how the ratings work, where they come from, how
they are compiled, what they mean, or where we stand in those rankings.

     If you wish to continue putting out misinformation, botched figures,
unnecessary panic, and foolish notions that have nothing whatsoever to do with
reality, well, that's your right.  And I'm going to call you on it and if your
comments are sufficiently stupid or misinformed, get a little testy, because
that's *my* right.  I came back and posted the exact numbers that are made
available.  It's not playing the ratings game except in the sense that the
ratings are always a game...a game whose rules you don't know or understand.

     For the week of 10/23 to 10/29, we were ranked #38 overall, out of a grand
total of 220 syndicated television series, including game shows, talk shows,
dramas, comedies, and everything else, and the 6th rated dramatic series for
that week.  And our demographics scores put us in around 2nd/3rd position.  We
did better than Highlander, Pointman, Kung Fu, the syndicated Tales from the
Crypt, and other dramatic series.  Outside dramatic series, we did better than
the Jerry Springer Show, America's Most Wanted, Sightings, Martha Stewart
Living, Rush Limbaugh, Siskel & Ebert, Richard Bey, and Donahue...all of which
are considered successful series.

     Those are the cold, hard facts, the hard numbers as delivered the the A.C.
Neilsen and Arbitron Companies.

     If I were currently worried about the show, if I thought the numbers were
soft, I'd be the first person sounding the clarion call and asking people to
write letters urging the show's continuance.  I'm not doing that, because
Warner Bros. is happy, PTEN is happy, and we're happy.  No one -- *no one* --
is more concerned about this show's survival than I am, and if I'm relatively
content with the situation, then we're in pretty good shape.

     You cite that some stations are moving the show into weird hours.  That is
correct.  First, it's only a very few stations out of nearly 200 stations;
those are, for the most part, Fox stations that have contractual commitments to
run Fox shows in prime-time, which is 8-10 p.m. Mon-Sun (they generally run
news 10-11).  All that's left in those stations -- and many markets only *have*
one or two independent stations -- is the non-prime time schedule.  That means
after 11 or before 7.

     You cite the Indianapolis station that dropped the show.  Yes, because WB,
feeling strongly about the show, pressured it for a better time slot, same as
in Grand Rapids MI.  They were locked in, couldn't give us anything better, so
the show left...and has not been REPLACED in the Indianapolis market on WNDY.
So once again your facts are incorrect by omission and
inaccuracy...Indianapolis DOES have B5 back now, on better station in many
ways, and we're in negotiations to bring it back to the two or three other
markets where the same thing has happened.

     In all the major markets, our ratings are *significantly* up.  In
Charlotte we're up 186% over this same time last year; Cincinnati up 233%;
Chicago up 133%; San Francisco up 135%...in Portland we blow the doors off
altogether.

     In short, Peter, you are absolutely, incontravertibly, dead-ass wrong.

     "I am only doing a favor to those out there who like the show."  No you're
not.  You're trying to whip up hysteria, get people upset, cause a crisis that
exists nowhere but in your own mind, because that's what you enjoy doing.

     And you clearly think that while you can come on here and say any thing
you want, if I come back and say you're wrong, somehow this is wrong, this is
only wanting to hear from groupies...as opposed to the simple fact that you're
*wrong*.  You want to have one set of rules for yourself (anything goes), and
one thing for me (shut up, bend over and take it without any backtalk).  I
checked my CIS agreement; that proviso isn't there.

     Anybody who comes on here and wants to express an opinion, negative or
positive, about the show is free to do so.  Anyone who comes on and offers what
he thinks are facts, and those facts are wrong, is going to be corrected.

     There is this little club of people who think that they should be able to
say anything they want, as addle-headed or inaccurate as may be, and that if
they're called on it, that's wrong, and that's interfering in their right of
expression.  Well, pal, I have a right to expression too, and guess what? The
facts are on my side of the argument, not yours.

     And they always come back with the same thing, "if it bothers you to hear
it, well, that's just the way things are," and "I am not some groupie or some
mindless fanatic," thereby denigrating everybody else, as if they are blind
followers, and only you see the truth, which is I'm sure exactly what you would
like to believe, and "you might not like to hear it, but I got a right to say
it."

     Absolutely.  You've got a right to be as asinine and incorrect and stupid
and ill-informed and prejudicial and hysterical and wrong-headed as you wish.

     And I've got the right to correct you.

     Deal with it.

                                                                       jms

Too much emphasis on being cute and biting, rather than discussing the merits

Atlantic...here the critics tend to dismiss the show, or get cutsie, or deride
it...but in the UK, publications from Home Entertainment to Time Out to even
the prestigious Radio Times have lauded the show, calling it some of the best
SF of the last decade.

<Up until the coup, was the EA government pretty good? They seem pretty

      The EA was fairly easy going, but remember that people are used to a
heavy governmental hand during the Earth/Minbari War.  It's in a way similar to
the situation we had post WW2; the only way we could make it past that war and
survive was through strict discipline, following orders, going along with
rationing, conserving, everything.  And it was that positive attitude that
those who came later would exploit in the McCarthy/Red Scare 1950s, and hit us
sideways in the 60s.

     Thanks.  And for "pulling a Talia" on Sheridan, that's one of the major
benefits in *doing* the Talia thing to begin with; it makes it very difficult
to sit back and accept that any character is going to be the key out of this

<So NO Silver Screen Ambitions?
What do you think about the end of SeaQuest? And how good are your

      Nope, no real interest in doing movies; it's really a director's medium,
so I prefer either television or print, which is a writer's medium.

      What do I think about the end of SeaQuest?  Well, it was kind of
inevitable, wasn't it?  If they had left it alone, in the hands of the people
who first created it, like Rockne O'Bannon, and quit pulling on it in every
possible direction, it could've been okay.  Instead, the Suits got involved,
and when the Suits get involved...you're dead.

To: All

     Well, today I got my complimentary copy of the new B5 screensaver (aka the
Limited Edition CDRom Entertainment Untility), from Sound Sources.  I have to
say that I'm extremely pleased with it.  (And folks around here know that if I
don't like it, I don't front for it.)

     I have it running now on both my home computer, and my work office
computer.  On the downside, it isn't exactly intuitive on the installation, and
there's not much of a manual.  You have to figure out some stuff on your own.
(Like when it says it installs all the wallpaper, it actually installs a
portion; you then have the option of using the Install aspect to go back into
the CDrom images area and getting the 150 or so other wallpaper images and
putting them into your system, and then using the Add and Select menus to
activate them.)

     I had a memory/sound conflict on the work computer on a few of the
modules, but no such problem on the home system (and since they're both nearly
identical systems, it tells me something's wonky with one of the computers, and
I have to figure this out.)  Maybe it has something to do with running Norton
Desktop.

     Those two caveats aside, and they're relatively minor...I love it. You've
got a whole bunch of video clips complete with sounds and/or music, 150
wallpapers, bunches of .wav files, using our actual sound library from the
show, plus music clips...it's just gorgeous.  And well displayed, well put
together.  It has what I was hoping for, a sense of a piece of Babylon 5 itself
in your system.

     As I understand it, there are only going to be 100,000 of these produced
for full national distribution, and apparently the phone and mail orders are
piling up, as are computer store orders.  So you may want to get it fast when
it appears, 'cause it may not stay on the shelves very long.

     I don't like to do a lot of merchandise, and when we do, it has to be of
superior quality; this one definitely qualifies.

                                                                       jms

     No, absolutely not true.  ABC is doing a series called "Hypernauts" for
Saturday morning kidvid -- live action plus cgi -- made by many of the same
people who do B5, including Ron Thornton/Foundation Imaging, with Kevin Cremin,
John Copeland, Doug Netter and many of our same directors.  But B5 has nothing
to do with it, nor do I personally.  This person has confused two different
issues/shows.

      What we're doing in the meantime is plenty.  Originally, the fourth and
final episode in this first batch of four was going to be "Voices of
Authority," which deals with just this question of preparing for the war in a
big way, has major developments, gets into the White Star...but the CGI
requirements of that episode were hideous, so we had to move it to #5 in the
lineup, moving up "Gethsemane."  Once we come back with new episodes, we'll hit
the ground running hard on all this stuff.

     Also bear in mind that wars aren't instant; in the real world, you have to
line up support, get into alliances, move all your pieces around before you can
get into it.  We're taking a similar path here.  Also, the term "shadow war"
refers to more than just the shadows as a race; they refer to what's going on
back on earth as well, as metaphor as well as plot point, and that's a huge
part of the next batch of eps.

<Do you believe fiction writing can be taught?>

     The answer is yes and no.  I've taught writing classes and workshops, and
it is entirely possible to take someone with a good command of the language and
make them publishable in the area of articles and other nonfiction.  Virtually
anyone can be trained.  You can also learn some of the basic *techniques* of
fiction.  But there's a quantum jump between what is required of the two basic
forms.

     By the time I was done, invariably people would sell in non-fiction. The
last time I did it, within 6 months of finishing the class, the percentage of
those who actually pursued it (as opposed to just dropping the ball and not
trying) and published was close to 100%.  Fiction, ah, that's different.

     When it comes time to make up your own stories, you either hear the music,
or you don't.  (And even if you don't, some folks can sell one or two items in
their lives.)

     That spark, that way of viewing the world and coming up with stories,
cannot be taught I think.  It's either there, or it ain't.

                                                                       jms

<In so many ways, you
remind me of Serling and Lovecraft.  Both strove with the gods and the devils
to produce the best, to tell the story, to turn the word on its ear, to tweek
the medium for all it could give, and then one more tweek.  There's another
Lovecraftian aspect to you, beyond the story-telling word, its this enormous
virtual circle of correspondents that you talk to each day.  Lovecraft had his
circle which nutured the likes of de Camp, Long, Howard, and Derleth.  I wonder
who out there in the ether is taking form as a writer by drawing nurishment
from this circle?>

      I don't think there can *be* any praise higher than to be included in the
same sentence as Serling.  Of my personal pantheon of writers, he's right up
there at the top.  And yeah, we've had to fight the same battles to get our
respective shows on the air, with the integrity we feel/felt was required for
the story.  But in the long run, the fight is worth it if it produces something
that lasts.

      About correspondents...I've heard from a number of folks, in the course
of this prolonged conversation, who say they've had the courage to begin
writing, or sending out what they write, because they've seen that it Can Be
Done.  A few of them have broken through, most have not, but it's a long
process, and there's plenty of time ahead.

     If the show can inspire anyone, even one person, to do more, or better,
then it has achieved its purpose.

      The absolution scene, based on what used to be called the rites of
extreme unction, or last rights, is now called the "celebration" of passing,
and I went to the Catholic church's information office, and got the actual
text.  I made a few adjustments here, condensing it a bit (on the logic that
Edward didn't have a lot of time), and modifying a few small points here and
there, on the second logical point that in 250 years, such might have taken
place (as the current ritual has been adjusted a bit here and there over the
years).  So if it felt right, it was.

     Yours is the second comparison here to Serling.  I think perhaps I can die
happy now.  To the "strong moral sensibilities" aspect...there has to be this.
The story must entertain, first and foremost, otherwise it's useless, because
no one will watch it.  But then there has to be something of substance at the
core of it, which elevates or ennobles or challenges.

     Re: the use of Lyta to extract the info...this is the main reason why
there's a Psi Corps, and there are exacting rules, otherwise it can easily
become deus ex machina.  We won't ever do this sort of thing trivially, and
here it was definitely meant to be a little disturbing...it was a sheer matter
of life or death, the guy was a creep, and somewhere Edward was bleeding to
death.  Even after so many viewings, and even having written the thing, I find
that one scene vaguely scary.

     It's the best of the first four, I think.  But better is coming....

<Now that you've finally been able to use the story of a mind-wiped criminal
learning of his past, can you say something about how different the story would
have been had you been able to do it in the first (?) season as you had
originally planned?>

      No, no nod to the person who suggested it, since this isn't a
competition, and the suggestion cost me a year where I couldn't do the story.
(So I wasn't in the cutest frame of mind about this for a long time, even
though it wasn't really his fault.)

     Basically, it would've been a one-shot, with two monks arriving to scope
out B5 for the arrival of the rest later on.  (You'll notice that none of the
other monks get into the story here; that's a hold-over from the original
outline, which I saw no need to change at this point.)  So this would've been
folded into an introduction to the order as they come to check out B5's
facilities.

     The third Serling story isn't so much strange, as were the other two, but
interesting, in that after that one first encounter with him, when I was
working on the new Twilight Zone series, they found an outline by Serling that
he had never put into script form...and they asked me to do the script based on
that outline, so here, twent-some years later, I ended up sharing a writing
credit with Serling on "Our Selena is Dying."  A collaboration, much after the
fact.
