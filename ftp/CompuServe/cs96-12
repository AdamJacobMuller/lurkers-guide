      Kosh went with the new vorlon into the ship, and that final
blast was what did the job ultimately.

      You wanna see the end of the story?  Huh?  Do you?  Do you?!

      Thanks!

      I've done some with Duke Nukem, but the thing's just a bit
repetitive for me, so I haven't gotten that deeply into the game yet.

      No, no one's done an article like that, though Stephen Smith did
spend a week on the B5 sets for Sci-Fi Universe Magazine.

      I'd much rather shoot 24 than 22, because it gives us more room
to spread things out, and try some different kinds of stories.

      We shoot from early August through May 5th, so the cast gets
about 2-3 months off.

      Actually, we kinda decided to cut back a bit on lens
flare...because that particular one is now used in so many places, it's
become a cliche.  We tried out a new kind of flare in the Kosh2 scene,
when he nails Sheridan, you can just sorta see it...once everyone else
does what we've been doing, we tend to move on to newer areas.

      Well, I think it's pretty obvious she would've known about it,
given hr proximity to Sheridan...and if I knew something this big was
going on, sure as heck *I'd* want to be there to see it.

       Yes, that's a Vorlon...and there was a physicality to them,

ghost or anything of that nature, it can be hurt and killed.

       Actually, Nation's record was about 13 or 18 in a row.

       And of those three elements, the personal life is the one that

       The finished film comes startlingly close to what I saw in my

goes beyond.

       I didn't think they looked that much alike.  But then, no two
people ever see Vorlons in quite the same way, I guess.

Subject: Sheridan chgd the Arc?

{original post unavailable}

       Sheridan, or someone like him, would've been brought in around
this time regardless, yes...but knowing this would happen, I was able
to skew the new character to have the elements, and be in the position,
that would most help me move the story along.

       And you're right...the longer you leave someone in command
there in the show, the more difficult and dangerous it becomes to
remove that character. If you're going to do it, best to do it earlier
than later.

                                                                  jms

       The long broadcast breaks don't give us a break because we
don't stop filming during them.  We start filming at the beginning of
August, and we shoot straight through to May, with only breaks for
holidays and a quick one-week hiatus in the fall and spring.  It would
be hideously expensive and difficult to stop and start shooting every
five weeks.

         There's a lot more to be said of the story of Kosh, and the
Vorlons in general...and part of me says explain it later...and another
part says that if you explain mysteries too much, it destroys them.

       I will, on *rare* occasions, address a note or correction
directly to an actor while we're shooting, but in general I give any
notes to the director on the set, who passes them on to the actor. 
There really can't be a multiplicity of voices talking to actors on the
set...it can become confusing, and they can get contradictory
directions.  They can get skittish and lose concentration.

       One occasion where I *did* do this recently...in the scene
where Londo explains to Cartagia why he shouldn't be killed for being
late, the director had Londo playing that scene submissive and nervous
in rehearsals, didn't understand that the whole point of the exercise
was Londo standing up to Cartagia, but doing so in a very sly way, not
giving him any room to maneuver. Cartagia likes Londo because there's
intelligence and steel, in a very manipulative fashion..."you think the
same way I do," Cartagia says. So before we shot the scene, I pulled
Peter aside and gave him the correction, and that's how we shot it.

       But, again, those incidents are fairly rare.

                                                                  jms

      The B5 reference in Captain Power was just a nod to something I
was working on...and definitely shows that it was in the works as far
back as 1986.

      Yes, we have shown diseases, particularly in "Confessions and
Lamentations," a 2nd season episode.  But in general, my sense is that
the biologies of aliens are sufficiently different to minimize most
transmitted diseases.

       I don't see it really as a change of heart...they've always
been very ruthless in their way.  Remember, it was the Vorlons who
simply decided to off Deathwalker in first season.

       There's some amount of escalation going on, obviously, which
will be explained a bit more in upcoming episodes, but they've always
been this way, it's your perception of them that's at odds.  You fell
for what they wanted you to see them to be.

      NBC didn't reject it, it was meant for syndication after the
network show was canceled; and most of the cast had moved on to do
other things. Actors don't generally just hang around waiting for shows
to get revived, they were not available in many cases, and my mandate
was to give the show a fresh start.

       Yes, B5 is fiction...but elements of it that appear here and
there are based on historical incident.  The CDA and other moves toward
censoring the arts or the internet or free speech are the logical
inheritors of Joe McCarthy's Senatorial inquisition, as well as earlier
verions.  The Nightwatch goes right back to those roots...and anyone
who thinks it can't happen here...it *has* happened here.  And can
happen again tomorrow.

      Yup.  Because during the Minbari war, the Narns were selling us
weapons, so Sheridan and other Earthforce captains had to learn at
least a smattering of Narnish for purposes of negotiations.

"Now, I *know* you didn't write all the episodes in Seasons 1 and 2,
but I wondered if there really was a connection between the planned
series length and "the name of the place."  After all, I suppose 5 is a
fairly arbitrary number--it could have been one or two or seventeen
earlier stations that were sabotaged during construction--but I never
really thought of the similarity."

      No, that was never the intent, that it was called Babylon 5
because it's 5 years of story.  The reporter just kinda came up with
that.

"The interviewer constantly uses the term "sci-fi," but, since I'm
sure that you are well aware of the controversy over it, I would have
presumed that you either would not have used it yourself (I don't think
I've ever seen it in one of your messages), or else that you would have
some particular statement-making reason.  If the latter, care to
expand?"

      No, I didn't use the term sci-fi, and NEVER use the term.  I use
either SF of Science Fiction, but interviewers insist in putting those
terms in my mouth because it's what they use.  I've complained to
several of them about this already.

"I'm not ruling out Babel Fish or belt-mounted Universal Translators,
or perhaps Lorien's ability to read Sheridan's mind and learn English
from it, but it does seem to me that things like this require at least
a minimum of explanation. "

There are several primary languages used on B5: Earth English,
Centauri and Interlac, the latter being a kind of Esperanto (all of the
important signs are in all three languages).  In addition, many
species, such as the Gaim and the pak'ma'ra, use translator devices,
since they're incapable of making human sounds.  Remember, you're
seeing ambassadors for the most part, or aliens in the trade or
commercial business, so they would tend to learn the dominant language
of the place they're working in.

"I'll hang on to the clipping if you want it for your scrapbook."

      I'd *definitely* appreciate a copy of that one, so I can pass it
on to WB for use in their PR, thanks.

       Correct.  Initially we'd wanted to put Walkabout in first, but
that would have meant airing only WWE1 in that sweeps period, and
having to wait until the fall for part 2, which seemed not only
excessive but remarkably stupid.  So we reversed the shooting/airing
order to accommodate that, and the fact that we knew we'd need a LOT of
EFX in WWE1, and this would give us time to do it properly.

      It opens a way to hyperspace, which does not have a 1-1

"...could you write empty-headed drivel?  I mean by that, something
devoid of the psychological depth, cultural allusions and
variously-voiced wit that we currently appreciate in B5."

      Never have before, and see no reason to start now.  Any time
I've worked on any show, I've tried to bring something special to it. 
Even when I was doing animation...the references in "The Real
Ghostbusters" got blindingly obscure and arcane from time to time (we
once referred to a group of eskimos of specific professions gathered to
handle a spiritual problem an "inuit minyan," which I figure about 8
people in the country got.)

      One thing that tends to be true of TV writing in general, not
just my case, is that once you know who's running and writing the show,
you have a fairly good idea of the kind of show you're going to be
getting, because shows tend to be direct outgrowths of the personality
of that writer.  You can use phrases like "a Chris Carter show," which
calls up one kind of show, or a "Carl Reiner kind of sitcom," or "a Rod
Serling kind of show."  A jms show falls into the same category.  I
like sharp, witty, in-depth writing; always have, always will.  So that
can be counted on as a constant.

      The other kind of writing you describe I couldn't do on a bet.

                                                                  jms

      Well, I think it fair to say that with Delenn starting the

this was going to be more than just a fling...and there's still a long
road ahead of them before this can be finalized.

      The PPG bursts would've wounded the shadow, allowing him time to
scramble out of there before Morden could draw.  He then had to fight
some other humans in the area, scramble down some ridges into the cave
areas, and then walk out.

Subject: From jms re: yr 4/5

There's been a fair amount of speculation and concern about the fifth
season, and how the story is laying out to handle the possibilities of
renewal vs. no renewal.  Though the ratings have continued to improve
despite the shifts and changes in the syndication marketplace -- it's a
very different market than it was when we first debuted -- nothing is
certain yet about a fifth season. Some at WB say yes, some say no.  My
job is to pick my way through this minefield and make it all  work, and
assure the story ending where is was meant to end.  So how does one do
this?

Here's the skinny.

First, you have to understand that writing is a *process*, and that
process is constantly changing.  Ask any writer, and they'll tell you
that many times they've been working on a short story, or a novel, and
they have to edit for space.  This applies to both fiction and
nonfiction writers.  Sometimes it's done by the writer, sometimes by
the editor.  On my second novel, the editor told me at the halfway mark
that we'd have to keep the book down to 100,000 words, which was about
75-100 pages less than I'd been planning on, so the story had to be
adjusted to fit.  As a journalist, I've often walked into the office
with a story in hand and been told, "Okay, you've got 15 column 
inches," or 25 column inches, or 10 column inches...and you just learn
to write to fit.  Every writer goes through this.

And in most cases, the average person never knows.  Done properly, it
should be seamless.  Look at Stephen King's The Stand, cut by almost
25% by the editors at first, then later released with all the ancillary
material replaced.  I've read both, and the latter is not appreciably
better than the former...if you didn't know the material was there, you
would never have missed it.

This also happens on a per-episode basis.  At LosCon, I showed a
finished scene from 405, and the daily of the master shot of the same
scene, which had another minute or so of material cut from the finished
scene.  We cut material all the time; if you added up all the material
cut from the third season, you'd have enough for almost two episodes. 
And we often slide material from one episode into another; we slid
Ivanova's scenes in 402 into 403, and another scene from 405 into
406...we've done that in prior seasons as well. Sometimes you go back
and you *add* material.  Again, it's all part of the process.

(Interestingly enough, I just bought the new laserdisk of "Young
Frankenstein," which has about 15 minutes of material cut from the
movie for time.  I watched it the other night, and of those 15 minutes,
13 were easily expendable...only one scene was fairly interesting, but
not really necessary.)

Okay, so how does all this relate to B5?

My obligation as a storyteller is to get to the end of the story in a
satisfying way.  So after we got the year 4 renewal, and knowing that
the PTEN business situation had the potential to impact us (when the
network that supports you is no longer there, so now your entire
structure is shot out from under you...you've got a problem), I looked
at the structure for the story, and began planning adjustments so that
it could go either way without padding anything, and without
shortchanging the story.

First thing I did was to flip out the stand-alones, which
traditionally have taken up the first 6 or so episodes of each season;
between two years, that's 12 episodes, over half a season right there. 
Then you would usually get a fair number of additional stand-alones
scattered across the course of the season.  So figure another 3-4 per
season, say 8, that's 20 out of 44. So now you're left with basically
24 episodes to fill out the main arc of the story.

Now, that arc is very intensive, and has three primary threads: the
resolution of the Shadow war, the situation regarding Earth, and a
series of smaller sub-threads that feed off those main threads.  But if
you charge right from one to the other, it's going to feel rushed,
you're going to need some breathing room between major movements,
particularly after the shadow war. Not so much stand-alones as episodes
that let you begin to rearrange your pieces for the next major
movement.  So now you're back up to about 27.

Okay, so *now* what do you do?  The solution to that came in several
unassociated pieces.

First came the word of the two B5 TV movies for TNT, which were
envisioned as taking place within the arc of our main story.  Suddenly
I had 4 hours into which I could slide some of this material.  One
sub-thread I'd been planning on was a 3-episode arc that would look at
how the Earth/Minbari War started, and Delenn's situation at the start
of the war, joining the Council, that sort of thing.  Now I was able to
split that out.  So in the series I can, in an episode, get into
Delenn's role in the war and go into the background of how she got to
know Dukhat, how she got into the Grey Council, and so on...all the 
stuff you'd need to see prior to the war. Then the two hours covering
the rest, the progress of the war itself, could be covered in the
two-hour movie.

With the *benefit* that we'd have a little more money for the movie
than we would for two conventional hours, so we could do *more* in the
way of EFX, production value, and so on, which you're going to need to
really sell the E/M war.  So strangely enough, and as tends to happen,
this has put us in the position of doing it *better* than if I'd
dropped it into two standard-budget episodes, as was my original plan.

Another sub-thread wouldn't have been introduced until late in year 5,
in part to set up the possibility of a sequel (which, as I've stated
from the very earliest days of the show, was always in the back of my
head) and which would stand on its own in any event; a thread designed
to illustrate the notion that the duration tends to be a lot longer
than the war. (You'll understand that one later.)  That sub-thread
would've filled about 3-4 episodes.

Now, again, having the second 2-hour movie lets me slide that piece of
story into that category and cover nearly all of that ground in doing
so. The remaining material could (and will, one hopes) be covered in
the actual sequel itself.  (If the sequel never ends up going, the
material will be sufficiently stand-alone to still work on its own.)

Then, finally, you take the stand-alones you pulled out earlier (which
nobody would miss, not knowing what was in them), and the final couple
of sub-threads (not yet introduced or implied in the main series) and
slide them into the sequel series, CRUSADE.

So if we *had* to collapse everything into a fourth year, it would all
fit perfectly.  If word came that there *was* going to be a fifth year,
you commission some scripts early, drop some of the stand-alones back
into the slot, and bring up the sub-threads that would otherwise have
been transferred into the sequel.

Bottom line is...you're covered either way.  You end up where you
wanted to end up, the main threads get dealt with, secondary or
tertiary threads have other venues in which they can be dealt
with...you're solid.

There's nothing particularly extraordinary or amazing in this...this
is how all writers work, since there are always going to be varying
constraints in length or venue.  Writing is a process, and that process
is such that it is infinitely variable while still proceeding where you
want it to go.

So that's where I am currently.  If I know the fate of the fifth year
by late February or early March, I can then flip either way and get out
cleanly. Worst case scenario is that I might have to write alternate
scenes or alternate endings for scenes in the last few episodes if the
word comes much later than that, just to give me the flexibility to
adjust the story in editing, which would definitely take place after we
wrapped, at which time we have to have word by contract.

None of this could've been done in three seasons...we had to have a
minimum of four to give us the flexibility of cutting either way. 
There's no point to reading a book that leaves you hanging for an
ending, and B5 was meant to have an ending.  At this juncture,
finishing off script 15, I feel very comfortable with the way all this
is laying out.  The flow is there, and I know we'll get where we need
to.  No matter what happens, we're covered. We can handle year 5 
without padding, and handle year 4 without shortchanging the
storyline. Granted it took only slightly less planning than the
invasion of Normandy, but it works, and that's the crucial thing.

Anyway...I've gone on for longer than I'd intended.  I hope that this
will answer some of the questions and concerns raised about the
situation, and explains how you do some of the planning for this kind
of thing.  Again, this online experiment is about letting people
understand the process of telling a story like this, and of making a TV
show in general.  As I've noted before, telling a story of this nature
for television, with all the exigencies and real-life surprises
involved, is like doing an elaborate step-dance while people are
throwing live chickens and chainsaws at you...but I knew that would be
the situation going in, and it was only a matter of whether or not the 
story was worth the grief involved in telling it.

And it most definitely has been.

terms of trips in cars, clothes you were wearing, or the like.  It's a
whole.  And that's how I tend to tell, and how I developed, the
story...sort of like remembering it all.

      Thanks.  I think the impact of the show will only continue to
grow with time.  In a few years, we'll be discovered, as though
suddenly we materialized on TeeVee...but that's okay.  It's the doing
that matters.

      Yes, the two TNT two-hours are confirmed.

      And the regular series will start on TNT right after the main
run is finished, starting with season one.  (So if we finish new
episodes in any given November, the show begins reruns on TNT the
following January.)

      Silicon or crystalline based lifeforms are still lifeforms, just
not the same as carbon-based lifeforms (like us).

      Well, basically, all there *is* are either arc shows or
stand-alone shows (or maybe somewhat stand-alones with a slight thread
running through them).  My feeling for now is that I just don't want to
do the same thing twice in a row...and maybe find some new approaches
along the way to the next project.

      You must understand how hideously difficult and exhausting
telling a 5 year tightly constructed story like this is...basically,
over the course of 4 years, I'll have written 3,000 pages all in one
universe, primarily telling one story.  That's the equivilent of 6 or 7
full-size novels in 4 years, telling one story.  After something like
that, you want to do something a little different for a bit.

      Four years ago, when I started carrying this elephant, I barely
had a grey hair on my head...now it's gone almost entirely grey, I look
as if I've aged 10 years, and people who see me after a gap of a few
years all say the same thing: "What the hell HAPPENED to you?"  I tell
them: Babylon 5.

      It got pushed due to the increase in the arc, but we hope to do
something with it eventually.

      I figure a) it's left to the viewer, and b) from my POV, he saw
what he said he saw.

      TNT picks up B5 whenever it's done, whether that's 4 or 5 years,
so it doesn't affect us either way.

      My only concern on the C4 thing is that, as far as I know,
nothing has been indicated by C4 either way on cuts of any sort, and I
know just enough about TV folks to know that if people act before even
*they* have reached a concensus, and may not in fact be accurate, it
tends to move them in the opposite direction from that desired.
