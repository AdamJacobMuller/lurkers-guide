     There is a growing diversification in the names and personnel 
to whom letters are being sent via the B5 mail drop (which is not 
the main studio address).  Consequently, it is important to be 
absolutely sure to include the words C/O BABYLON 5 on any mail you 
send cast or crew at this address: 14431 Ventura Boulevard, Suite 260,
Sherman Oaks, CA 91423.  Otherwise it may end up being returned.

     "Joe, you do not disappoint."

     I'm trying *awful* hard not to.  Doing this show right is terribly 
important to all of us involved in it.  I really want it to be the kind 
of show I've always wanted to watch as a fan.  And I'm very, very pleased 
that the writing is generally satisfactory.  Sometimes, when 
behind the keyboard, one has grave doubts if it's good enough....

     As it happens, we've found out, a LOT of toy stores have gotten the 
B5 micromachines, but very few actually put them out on the racks, not 
knowing anything about the show (our curse continues).  In general, 
if people go into their local medium/large sized toy stores, 
and ask them to check in the back, they appear.

     We've done a couple of steady-cam/CGI composite shots, but not 
that much; in "And Now For a Word," you'll sometimes see a floating
recorder in C&C moving around...that was a steady-cam in use, and we 
composited in the CGI.  It is, however, time-consuming, so we only do 
that sort of thing as required.

     You always have to be careful when a studio says it hasn't turned 
a profit on the show.  They say this for the primary reason that certain 
people involved with series and movies -- stars, creators, executive 
producers -- get a percentage of the net profit.  Conseuqently, it 
is studio and network policy to make absolutely sure that, whatever the 
real facts might be, none of their products *ever* show a profit *on paper*.  
You always charge something more against the income, and make sure you zero 
out the profits to avoid sharing it with anybody else.

     It's the oldest gag in the book, and in any public statement, that's 
the party line.

      "...you could ask for a MUCH smaller percentage of gross."

      The only acceptable percentage of gross profits is zero.  
Unless you're a megastar or megadirector.  Other than that,

     Because it gives you at least a shot, if the show is a huge 
success, of eventually going in and having the right to examine 
their books and at some far distant point, if you're willing 
to throw away your career but there's some serious money to be 
had, of going after them.  (Did you know that the majority of actors 
from the original ST, outside the so-called Big Three, have over 
30 years received only about $16,000 from ST in merchandise, profit, and 
other areas?)

     I believe it was Fess Parker who finally sued over profits 
from his series, which after 25 years of syndication, was still 
supposedly "in the red."  It took several years of litigation to 
get the money he was owed from his "net."

Subj:  the NEW sf standard		Section: Babylon 5
  To:  David Chandler-Gick, Sunday, August 06, 1995 12:52:17 AM
From:  J. Michael Straczynski, 71016,1644#290359

     Let me address the small points first, then go into the major 
thesis.

     What keeps B5 from becoming a "cult" series if it runs only its 
five years?  I dunno...lots of shows run only 5 years or less.  The 
majority of them, in fact.  I'd also point out that in the moderately-
hard SF area -- space stuff, star travel and the like -- no show has EVER 
gone five years except Star Trek.  Even Lost in Space went only 3 years 
(September 1965 to September 1968).  Prior to the new incarnations of ST, 
the original series ALSO didn't make it past 3 years.

     So if you really *want* to look at the only non-Star Trek spacefaring 
SF series to go (hopefully) five years in, oh, the entire HISTORY of 
American television and minimize that by calling it a "cult" series, well, 
that's certainly your right.  I don't agree with it, but one wouldn't expect 
me to.

     Twin Peaks, which only went about 2, max 3 seasons, is a short enough 
run to be justifiably called a "cult" show.  Five seasons is a credible 
series in *anyone's* book.  Right now, at just shy of year two, we're still 
a cult series.  By year five we would not be; we'd be in the same ranks as 
any successful TV series, and success is defined as 90-100 episodes in the 
can, enough to syndicate thereafter.  So right from the git-go, the term 
being used, "cult series," doesn't apply, I think.  It's no more a cult 
series than any mainstream series that goes 5 seasons.  (Hill Street Blues 
just *barely* made it to six years.)

     Blake's 7 is a UK series, and to American audiences, that usually 
becomes "cult" by definition.  And, again, B7 ran only 4 years, from January 
1978 - December 1981.  Dr. Who, though gifted with a 20+ year run, is also not 
much known in the US, and thus comes under a "cult" show heading by that 
default.  (Because part of the definition of cult show is not a numerical 
issue, as you seem to advance, but a philosophical issue, the extent to which 
the society at large knows about the show, or elements of that show.)

     But to continue using your terminology for a moment...Space 1999, which 
you cite, ran only from 1975-1977, three years again, which once more does 
not allow for any real momentum to be built up in making the general populace 
aware of it.  Quantum Leap made 5 years, but since we're talking space-SF at 
the moment, and it'sreally more of an anthology series with recurring 
characters, that goes into a separate category for now.

     If this show goes the full five years -- and it will -- it will become 
the only non-Star Trek space series to do so in the history of American TV. 
That is a *huge* accomplishment.  Will it become widely known and accepted by 
the American consciousness, mainstreamed like ST, so that Jay Leno can comment 
on Klingons and everybody in the audience knows what he's talking about?  
Who knows?  Maybe, maybe not.  Doesn't really matter to me one way or another.  
The show will be there.  A painting is no less a 
painting for the number of people who pass in front of it.  It is what it is.

     I could probably help matters a bit by going more for merchandising, put 
in some scantily-clad women, doing a lot of stunts...but I've said from the 
start, I'm not here to try and make a franchise, I'm here to tell a story.  
Some folks will like it, some won't.  Them's the breaks.

     So the thesis of your panel, in some measure, seems to be, If B5 does 
not become as well known as ST, is it ultimately successful or important in 
American culture?  To me, this is inherently flawed reasoning.  ST is only the 
measure of ST, and nothing else.  I'd even argue that except for the original 
series, there really isn't any one thing called Star Trek.  There was the 3 
season show that Gene did in the late 60s; there was the first movie Gene did 
in the late 1970s; the other movies that were done by other people, like Nick 
Meyer and Harve Bennet; the TNG series that was created by Gene and David 
Gerrold; the DS9 that was created by Berman/Pillar; and the ST:V created by 
Piller, Berman and Taylor.

     They are all, in many ways, very different creations, that share only one 
thing: the brand name.  If you renamed B5, STAR TREK: BABYLON 5, the ratings 
would go up instantly, and it would become more of a household name than it is.  
It would be no different a show, but it would have that brand name behind it.

     "What keeps Trek from falling into the "cult" classification is the 
ongoing production."  Negative.  To play one side of the coin for a moment, 
the second most of the population knows or recognizes the word "Klingon," it has 
stopped being a cult show, *on a philosophical level*.  And that happened long 
before TNG ever went into production.  That happened over the 20 years the 
original three-season ST was in syndication.

     To play the other side of it...I hate to break it to you, but media SF is 
STILL considered a "cult" area, by critics, by networks, by the press, by most of 
the population.  A very small portion of viewers watch SF, including ST.  It may 
seem to you otherwise, because as SF fans we're nominally in the fishbowl, but it's 
true.  In syndication, you need far fewer ratings points to survive.  Overall, 
neither TNG nor DS9 got anywhere near decent network ratings, though there were a 
few times in TNG's history -- the pilot and a couple others -- where it approached 
that.  Put onto a network series list, they would both be where ST:V is right now...
in the cellar.

     So, overall, I think the entire thesis of the panel is flawed, and proceeds 
from the trap of accepted cliche, misinformation and fuzzy thinking that has little 
to do with the realities of TV and culture.

     Now to the main point of *my* thesis here.

     I'm frankly tired as hell of "ST vs. B5" or "ST/B5" panels, however they're 
couched.  They are separate shows, they have nothing to do with one another, 
they're as different as night and day, and the only reason to put them into the 
same panel is to start a fracas or take a philosophical position by defined 
contrariness.  And, fundamentally, it continues to put ST at the center of the 
universe.  We're going on our third season now, and things look good for seasons 
thereafter.  We've carved out our own identity. why can't we be taken or discussed 
on our own?  Why does there always have to be this nutty feud?

     Are you going to be doing ST/Quantum Leap panels?  Will there be any X-Files
/Star Trek panels?  No, because they're nothing like Star Trek, AND NEITHER ARE WE.  
Yet everywhere we go, ST follows us around like Marley's Ghost, rattling its chains 
and dominating the conversation.

     "Can Babylon 5 replace Trek as THE icon of SF?...without a continued run."
First off, THE icon to whom?  To core ST viewers?  Of course not.  To core B5 
viewers?  In many cases, it already has.  You equate numbers of episodes to 
quality of episodes.  Many SF writers have written MORE novels than Robert Heinlein...
but how many have written them BETTER?  And which is more an icon of SF?  Who is 
this person who decides what a media or print SF *ICON* is?

     The Oxford American Dictionary defines "icon" as, "a painting or mosaic of 
a sacred person, *itself* regarded as sacred."  If that's the Pointy Hat under 
discussion, I'd rather pass, all things considered.  I don't WANT this show to 
become an ICON.  I want to tell this story, about these people.  You can't sit 
there worrying if it's going to become a Huge Eternal Monster, or some revered 
icon, or anything that comes after the fact. That way lies madness.  You can 
only concentrate on telling the story, and making the program, as best you can.  If the audience finds you, and likes it, you get to stay on the air and finish 
your story; if not, you don't.  That simple.

     Nothing personal in this, btw, this isn't a flame, and I'm not annoyed,
I'm just trying to answer the question honestly.  And yes, the info you 
provided re: BB was most helpful.

                                                                       jms

     Understood.  No healing needed; it wasn't directed at you as much 
as the topic.

     I do understand your point; but I still don't think it's valid.  
If by cult you mean, as you say, "anyone who is a fan of something that 
is no more," not being produced, then EVERY TV series ever produced, 
that is now no longer being produced, becomes a "cult" show.  Again, that 
broadens the definition to the point where it's essentially meaningless.  
Specificity In Language Is Our Friend.

     The other point that I forgot to bring up in an already overlong reply 
was this: you ask, can B5 "become the mainstream reference to SF?"  For 
starters, it shouldn't, because then, for the mainstream SF = B5, and I don't 
think that's correct.  The whole point of the exercise is to broaden out and 
encourage MORE SF on the air.  What is the mainstream reference for cop shows?  
Is it CANNON?  HILL ST. BLUES?  NYPD BLUE?  DRAGNET?  There are so many of them, 
there isn't one clear point of reference.  That is the goal with SF, to get 
people to understand that there isn't any one thing that is a reference point 
to SF.

     What would it be in literature?  Heinlein?  Asimov?  Clark?  Ellison? 
Ashton-Smith?  Russell?  Simak?  Bradbury?  Anybody who says that Writer X is 
THE reference point in SF would be laughed out of the room.  The only reason 
that ST has kind of "been" that by default is that there hasn't been much 
ELSE in 30 years that's been even moderately successful.  Once that changes, 
you'll get to the *proper* definition of SF, as advanced by (I believe)
Asimov, who said, "SF is whatever I point to when I say, 'That's SF.'"

     (Which, by the way, is one of Paramount's greatest fears.  Until now, 
they've had a lock on the genre, and ST has thus been special, and they're 
worried that if there are lots of space genre shows around, that ST won't
be *special* anymore, and will have to compete on its own merits.)

     The other thing to consider in all this is the cultural aspect.  Will 
there ever be another Beatles?  No.  Because as well as their artistic 
contributions, the Beatles occupy a very special place in music history; 
they were nominally the first really big breakthrough for what we now 
consider modern rock.  They were the biggest.  They changed the field of
rock forever, redefined it, gave it tools that did not exist before, gave 
it a measure of legitimacy it did not have before.  Many other bands since 
have sold more records, but none will ever occupy that primary, pivotal 
position in our culture.  There cannot be another Beatles, and you cannot 
define another group in that light, despite every six months somebody
coming out and saying that X is "the new Beatles."

     Ditto Star Trek.  It is very much a product of its time, and it fills 
that same kind of pivotal role in SF television.  It changed SF TV back in 
the 1960s, no mistake.  It occupies a unique niche in American television 
that cannot be replicated.  Which is why I've always run from reporters who 
ask if this is the next Star Trek, if I'm "the next Roddenberry," and the
like, because there can't be either, any more than somebody is the next 
Beatles.

     The fundamental problem is that after ST went off the air, nobody
picked up the ball they'd created and ran with it.  They chipped at the 
stereotype of SF, and broke some of it, but nobody followed through with
another show.  DRAGNET changed forever cop shows; prior to then, they were 
always considered low-ratings shows, of interest only to those who like 
police procedurals.  For all its stiffness, DRAGNET showedcops with real 
lives, drinking problems, debts, marriages, dinners, dating...and in 
very short order, other shows followed suit.  Had that not happened, cop 
shows that came 20 years later would've been compared with Dragnet, since 
that would be the only reference point.  But it *did* happen with Dragnet
..and it *didn't* happen with Star Trek.

     The larger the possibilities, the less likely ANYthing is to be a
"reference point."  And that, to me, is the goal.

                                                                    jms

The whole REASON was to do stuff we couldn't do otherwise.

     Book 3 will be out later this month.  No plans on hardcover.  DC keeps 
saying book 11 is the last, but I've been told by WB that the deal to extend

From:  J. Michael Straczynski, 71016,1644#293427

     For some time, I've been cautioning people dealing in pirated 
material; videotapes, Links, PPGs, the whole gamut.  The usual 
reaction from those involved is, basically, screw off, on the grounds 
that there's plenty of ST pirated stuff out there, and nobody does 
anything about it.  Well, for starters, that's because there's a lot 
of grey about the copyright during the period during which ST wasn't 
being produced, and the copyright wasn't being enforced.  Second...
we're not ST.  A mistake many pirates continue to make, to their 
detriment.

     To the pirates out there, be warned: Warner Bros. is prosecuting 
these cases to the full extent of the law.  Case in point: I saw 
bootleg copies of B5 episodes for sale at the Chicago ComicCon, 
confiscated them, and told the person selling them, David Scott, 
*not* to do this anymore, because if he did, we would come down on him
..hard.  His reaction was basically a shrug.

     So this same person showed up at San Diego Comic Con, selling the 
same B5 tapes.  WB was notified.  And the FBI showed up and seized the 
material. And that of the other shows he was selling.  He tried to make 
light of it at the time, nobody follows through on this stuff, after 
all.  Wrong again.  He has been prosecuted by Time Warner Entertainment,
with charges filed in United States District Court (case number 92-1602 
H POR), and there has already been a judgment rendered to the tune of 
*thousands* of dollars.

     To the pirates out there: be warned.  We're not kidding around.  We 
will take you down, hard.  Especially those selling the poor-quality 
videotapes, and those selling supposed "real props" from the series, 
which are simply cheap knockoffs with expensive price tags to separate 
fans from their money.

     (And to the OTHER dealer in Chicago, who was selling fake PPGs and 
other items, from whom I confiscated the illegal goods, and has since 
been mouthing off to other dealers that in lawfully confiscating this 
material I "shoplifted" -- and I confiscated this stuff in front of 
several witnesses, and put the dealer on notice as to what I was doing -- 
by all means, continue running your mouth; you assiduously didn't have an 
address anywhere available, and your behavior will simply make it that 
much easier for us to find you.)

     One of the reasons that I'm very careful on what we do and don't 
license is that I want them to be done *right* when they're done; as a 
fan, I've grown to despair over cheap knockoffs whose exorbitant price tags 
only feed the sharks that made them.  I won't have inferior quality products 
out there, licensed or otherwise.  We take great pains to make everything 
involved with this show of the highest quality, and will not allow anyone 
outside to hinder that effort.

     The limited edition is numbered and signed by Harlan.

     Under the terms of the Writers Guild Basic Agreement, to which all 
the major studios are signatory, the actual physical manuscript remains
the property of the writer, *not* the studio, under the Separation of 
Rights clause.  So it's 100% kosher for Harlan to reproduce the material.

     Depends on how you define knockoffs.  If she walked into a store and 
found xeroxed copies of her book for sale, that's absolute, blatant copyright 
infringement, and can be confiscated.  This is a similar situation.  But you 
don't just "fill your bag with the offending items and depart."  You go 
directly to the person running it, show them the item, and tell them exactly 
what you are doing, why you are doing it, what law they have broken, and that 
you are confiscating this illegal material.

     If they make a fuss over it, then what you do is to go find the nearest 
security person or police officer, put them into contact with the WB Legal 
Affairs office, and they will fax a note authorizing the police to not only 
confiscate the material, but to seize any *related* material, AND to press both 
civil and criminal charges against the person.  If that means bringing the 
FBI in, so be it.  They have a whole division specifically to protect tv and 
film product against copyright infringement, particularly video pirates.

     So it's in the best interests of the person at the dealer's table to 
cooperate.  I'm fully authorized to do this, and they don't have a legal leg to 
stand on, and they know it.  So it's best to just warn them, and take it, and 
hope they stop.  They get one chance to do it right.  After that....

     If they choose to turn cranky, well, that's their perogative, and I won't 
carry anything out...I'll just have their butt arrested, charged, and fined.

                                                                       jms

     CITY was only published once before, in an anthology of SF play scripts, 
something like 20 or so years ago, and has not been seen since, nor is the 
original available.

     Two things I forgot to mention: the limited edition is a numbered edition 
SIGNED by Harlan, and the longest afterword is by David Gerrold, who I 
inadvertantly left off the list of contributers.

     What's also worth pointing out is that, thus far, the new producers of The 
Outer Limits have shown no interest in doing a follow-up to Demon, which is short
-sighted, to say the least.

     It would be difficult, but do-able.  It would've run like this:
I hire a writer/producer as show runner on the every day aspects of 
running the series; all scripts go through me after he's done his work 
on them for any final thoughts from me (outlines also); the show runner 
handles casting of guest stars, but I'd be involved in the casting of 
regular/recurring cast. We'd work together where time allowed.  But for 
the moment, it's a moot issue in any event.

     Not going to happen.  We get a broadcast schedule from PTEN that 
tells us when new episodes/reruns will air, and we book our delivery 
schedule accordingly; this allows us maximum time to finish tweaking 
the episodes by taking advantage of the rerun periods.  The only way

     They believe in a variety of afterlives; the god you worship, of the 
centauri pantheon, holds dominion over a given "heaven" or afterworld.  
If you appease the god sufficiently during life, it will accept you into 
that afterworld, in preparation for the day when all heavens are united; 
if not, you will have to be reborn and choose another until one accepts you.

     Yeah, that seems to be the tendency; each time we've introduced 
someone, it's gotten hammered...nobody liked Ivanova in the beginning, 
they said she was nothing but an ice maiden...they made fun of Vir, 
said he was nothing more than comic relief, ridiculous, had no business 
being assigned to Londo...there were grave doubts about Londo and the 
hair...Sinclair got hammered in the beginning...Sheridan got hammered 
in the beginning...and each time people assumed that what the character 
seemed to be at the start was all the person would ever be.  Even when 
it was shown that other characters grew into something other, still it 
was hard for a lot of folks to assume that this new character would do 
the same, and become interesting over time.

     Tom:

     So good of you to emerge from seclusion to post this via Linda.  I 
wish your message touched the facts at two contiguous places, but one 
cannot have everything.  I do hope this won't be another post-and-run 
situation, because there's much to clarify here.

     So you're saying that because Michael O'Hare initially said he 
wouldn't be coming, you fined him the $5,000 remaining on his fee, and he 
agreed to this.  Aside from the loathesome mentality behind this excuse, 
please explain to me why it was that on the Sunday of Chicago Comic Con, 
Michael had been told, by you, that you would be present by 12 noon, with 
that very same $5,000 owed as his balance...and never showed up.  If he had 
agreed to this, then why was he still awaiting this payment, and why were 
you saying you would have it for him?

     Simple answer: because Michael O'Hare agreed to no such thing.  This 
is a cover story to excuse non-payment of Michael's fee.  Further, you 
told some users on this very system that Michael had been paid the balance 
of his fees, in phone conversations, even offered to send a photocoy of the 
canceled check (which of course never happened).  You really should work 
more on getting your story straight.

     We have begun documenting, in writing, some of the destructive and 
hurtfulthings you have put out on the rumor mills about Michael, myself 
and others...so your assertion that you "would never hurt" anyone doesn't 
carry much weight at this end of the modem.

     I have had a good conversation just today with Deborah Smolinski at 
Visions, and we are working closely with them on this situation.  Certainly 
they should notbe faulted for falling for rumors started by others.  The 
purpose of the convention is not, and never has been, the issue.  As for 
your statement that "I have never spoken to Bob Mcgloughlin since the Big 
Bang show in June," Deborah said about 90 minutes ago that you and he had 
spoken just recently about this situation.  Who am I to believe?

     "JMS wants CMC and myself out of the science fiction convention 
business."  No, I simply will not allow the offenses and incomeptence on 
record to stand without comment.  Even after the Planet Hollywood debacle, 
in which I sent you a several-page letter explaining what would be required 
to fix the apparent problems, there was the spirit of cooperation until such 
time as you began selling unlicensed B5 jackets, patches, and posters for a 
non-existent charitable cause that used our name.  At that time, I told you 
that Babylonian Productions was withdrawing all support from this convention, 
and I would caution my cast in this regard, though leaving them to make their 
own decisions.  Some of them went out of concerns for the fans who had 
purchased non-refundable airline tickets and would be screwed otherwise.

     And as long as you're here, some additional points.

     Mark Hamill has been stiffed by you to the tune of $21,000.  The check 
for his speaking fee has, he tells us, bounced.  Another check made out to 
cover first class airfare and accommodations has also bounced.  Why hasn't 
Mark been paid?  Why do you write checks that can't be covered?

     I have received messages from many people...the photographer you hired 
to shoot the convention, travel agents, security people...who say that they 
have not been paid by you.  Why have they not been paid?  They come to me 
because you promoted this as a B5 convention, so I have inherited the 
problems you created by default.

     Why did you have someone working on designs on the fraudulent Project 
Starfury months after you had been told to cease and desist from such 
endeavors, with this individual putting in $5,000 worth of work that has 
now been wasted?

     Why were you telling people -- and we have now written documentation 
to that effect -- that I had been "tossed out of the Writers Guild" when 
such is not true?

     Many users here and on other systems have repeatedly asked you for 
refunds on their tickets.  Why has this not been forthcoming?

     In your newsletters, and your talks, including your May 28th meeting 
with fans in Schaumburg, IL, you stated that one of the major features of 
the convention would be the transformation of the Odeum theater into 
"Outpost Odeum," with massive role-playing aspects, props, and a scripted 
game which would include appearances by paid actors performing with the 
"Outpost Odeum" game.  Many went for this reason.  Yet no such event 
was presented.  You promised, in detail, a Sandman reenactment from Logan's 
Run; what happened to *that*?

     Would you care to comment on the assault on a dealer by staff, when he 
attempted to document poor conditions in the dealer's room, which led to 
hospitalization and surgery for severe injury to his eye?

     An individual began selling video tapes of our actors appearances at 
Big Bang.  He was told, by you, that you had contractual freedom to make and 
distribute these tapes, when, in fact, the contracts stated clearly that 
no such video or audio sales of the performance could be done unless a 
seperate agreement were entered into and signed by the actors.  Why 
was this person misled?

     For months now, many people here and on the other nets have been 
posting their dissatisfaction that what was promised by Big Bang was not 
delievered upon.  Since you clearly have access to the nets, as shown by 
your posting, why have you not previously addressed the concerns raised by 
so many people who attended your convention?

     Finally, let me repeat once more: my concern, ever since the Planet 
Hollywood event, was that the Big Bang convention was being poorly and 
incompetently run, and would hurt fans, and I wondered at the capacity of 
CMC to deliver on its promises.  The reactions from virtually every person
attending the convention bears out my concerns.  Cast members returned saying 
uniformly that it was the worst-run convention they had ever seen, and some 
had been attending conventions for over 20 years.  It was a disaster, and has 
left a pile of debris that you have yet to clean up, and which comes to 
*my* attention because they can't find *you*...with phone numbers that get 
disconnected, calls that don't get returned...and always you try and 
blame others.

     Everything I have said about BB has come true; your statements, 
however, are another question altogether.

                                                                 jms

     Except that Michael O'Hare has already been dragged into this.  
And Tom's latest message does it again.  On the one hand, he says Michael 
is a good man...and then, by implication, by alleging that Michael agreed 
to do the Big Bang without receiving the second $5,000, implies that Michael 
lied to and defrauded the fans at Comic Con.  That fundraiser was done 
because he did not receive the balance of his payment.  According to Tom, 
there *was* no balance of payment.  So clearly, someone here is fabricating.  
By his message, Tom is implying that Michael lied to me, and to the convention 
goers who came to his support.  Or that we both lied about it.

     We didn't.

     Thank you.  Over the years, I've worked extremely hard to develop 
a rep based on trust, and loyalty.  That this has sometimes gotten me 
into trouble goes almost without saying.  It's one of the things that 
matters most to me, because I've been in positions when I've been 
screwed, and vowed never to do it to anyone when I was on the opposite 
side of the desk.

     Here, for me, is the most telling thing.  Talk to anyone who's ever 
visited the B5 set and production office.  The one sound you hear the 
most often, in either place, is laughter, people *enjoying* their work.  
That is probably one of the things I'm most proud of.

     Whenever you hea a producer say, "Oh, we're one big family," you know 
nine times out of ten they're lying.  And, in fact, we're not like a family; 
more like a bunch of guys who get together ten months out of the year to 
have fun, make a show, play around and hang out with each other.  Everybody 
has lunch together behind the stage, whole huge groups go off on vacation 
together, after hours lots of them hang out, have dinner...we look after our 
own.  We are one of the very few studios -- and this includes the majors -- 
that provides health insurance for our employees whose premiums are 100% 
employer paid.  During the time after the big quake, we pulled carpenters 
off sets to help several people save their homes from water damage and other 
problems until real construction could be done; when the fires hit, we had 
teams ready to drive into fire zones to evacuate our DP when it looked like 
his house might go up.  We take care of our own.

     And as much as is ever possible, we try and look out for our viewers as 
well.

                                                                  jms

     You really do have to be totally and completely monomanaical to do this 
job if you're going to do it right.  So B5 is my life.  If I'm not writing 
or directly working on it, I'm watching dailies or thinking about where to 
take the show.  I have a pad beside my bed and frequently I wake up in the 
middle of the night with a scrap of dialogue or a plot solution, so 
I scribble it down and leave it where my feet land so I'll remember it's there.  
I don't get a hell of a lot of sleep during the week, and try to crash on

     To the rest you cite...there isn't time for much of anything else. I've 
seen a grand total of 1 or 2 movies at theaters in the last eight months; I 
haven't gone to a single party for longer still; except for twice weekly 
dinners with Harlan, we don't see anyone for dinner, I haven't had a chance to 
read a novel since the start of the year, I barely follow the news anymore...
it's literally a round-the-clock job.  But it's okay, because this is what 
I've been working toward since 1987.

<Just a thought, but Ed Wasser, in an interview in TV Zone, refers to 
what we've been calling the Shadows, in the singular, the Shadow,
a couple of times. 

BTW Whatever you're paying AK and PJ it isn't enough, they have been 
wonderful throughout the series, but in The Long, Twilight Struggle, 
Comes the Inquisitor and The Fall of Night they were superb. I hope 
you have them under cast-iron contracts for the rest of

     They have to ride the signals between beacons; you can't just 
go wandering around or you'll get lost, so you have a highway of 
related beacons.

     We're talking here William Messner Loebs, right?  So I'm confused, 
then; I've seen his credit endlessly...I guess I'm having prolonged brain 
fart, because I could swear it was on Flash (but you're right on the Mark 
Waid part...senility is definitely creeping in).

     Whether or not GG is making a mess in Comics Forum is not the issue 
for me; he's *there*, and as such the forum members are vulnerable to being 
quoted out of context, without their permission, in his mean-spirited little 
rag, and I refuse to make that process any easier for him by being there.

     You should definitely have Rob Davis call Laura Hitchcock at DC, if he 
is interested; we're doing 13 more issues -- one-shots and 4-issue miniseries 
-- so there's room to play.

     Agreed.  The use of different tactics and weapons at different distances 
gives a sense that there is a *strategy* behind what's going on, that it's not 
just two ships coming with city blocks of one another and clobbering each other.  
Strategy implies intelligence, and to see intelligence in the shadow vessels 
is scary indeed.....

Not really, re: stealth ships, but there is something in us all that responds 
nervously when something large and dark and menacing flies overhead, particularly 
close-up.  Maybe it's second-cousin to the instinct that makes baby ducks run 
for cover when the shadow of a hawk falls over them.  Either way, it's 
compelling, and that sense is what I wanted in that shot.

     Your analysis is *exactly* correct.

     Also, check Sebastian's reaction when he asks Delenn what if she's wrong, 
"have you ever considered that?  HAVE YOU?"

     She responds, softly, "....yes."

     Look at his face when she says this.  It rattles him.  It's not the answer 
he expected, but more important, it's not the answer he wanted, needed to hear.
He needed to hear her say that she had never had the slightest *scintilla* of
doubt, that as he had been, she was a True Believer, a fanatic, incapable of
doubt of mistake...and thus doomed to failure.  He can't even meet her gaze; he
turns, looks away, and suggests an "intermission" that is more for his benefit
than hers.

     There's an awful lot going on in this show, a great deal of it sub rosa,
under the surface, implied in gestures or hesitations or looks, some implied,
some stated outright.  He *hates* the memory of Jack; it's not his name, the
one thing that is his...remember, he is caught up with "who ARE you?" and his
answer to that is lost in the persona created by history...his true name, is
what's totally forgotten to history.

     I'd say that those are good and accurate points all around, well 
considered.  As for locale, it was similar to, but not exactly the same 
as the one in which the Marcabs died, though I did want to somewhat evoke 
the memory of that when I indicated the set I had in mind.

     Of course, his real name was never Jack Sebastian; "Jack" 
is his working name, Sebastian could be a first or last name.

     It wasn't intended that Delenn should touch Draal; it sorta 
happened on the set, and no one really noticed, and it wasn't worth 
going back and reshooting the whole thing.  My sense is that if it's 
like a virtual reality situation, she would "feel" it even though 
it's not there, if the image was impinging correctly on the brain.

     But in either event, the image is not and should not be considered 
to be solid.

     As for Londo's shot...the director called "cut" I think a bit too 
soon, we used every frame we had to extend that shot (and, in fact, we 
even went so far as to freeze the final frame and extend the shot by a 
smidge, if you look at it carefully).  Nonetheless, I think it works 
pretty spiffily.

     As for the mass drivers, the amount of energy required to move 
something that big would generate huge amounts of heat, possibly making 
them even white-hot, hence the glow.

     Anyway, thanks for the comments; I do think it's possibly either 
the best, or one of the best shows to that point.

     Yes, it was a definite nod to Chamberlain, and a bit of foreshadowing 
for ominous things to come.

     There are a number of metaphors in the show that operate on many 
different levels; it can't be a one-to-one corrolary to WW II, because 
that limits and makes predictable your story.

     In musical terms, it's almost a tonal piece, taking elements to 
which we respond, almost subconsciously, and then rearranging them into 
something that is, one hopes, a new construct.  You can find here echoes of 
Vietnam, of Kennedy, of Chamberlain, of WW II, of Korea, of the Mideast; 
in a way, it's a thematic piece that touches how we have come to think of 
war, and conflict, across the development of the 20th century, and the 
role of the individual in that regard.

     We have learned to think of war as something now on a huge scale, 
an entity in itself.  Once upon a time, before the gatling gun and the 
automatic rifle, combat was something individual, even in larger wars, 
one person against the enemy...and that person was honored, one person 
could turn the tide against the enemy.  In a world in which weapons of 
mass destruction exist, where then is the individual?  Where then the 
bravery, the struggle, the triumph...and the failure?  Where, 
fundamentally, is the responsibility?

     All of that is intertwined with the storyline, and to communicate that 
I'm not averse to taking elements of history that resonate with that theme 
and reworking them, knowing that on a cellular level, we *recognize* that 
aspect, we've seen it...but now in a new context, we can see it differently, 
discuss its implications, *learn* from it.

     This is one of the things I rarely talk about, because it's the kind of 
thing that is best left simply implied, or implicit, in the work, and because 
if you have to draw attention to something in the work, somehow I think it 
lessens it, because it works best unspoken.  And because I guess it sounds 
kinda presumptuous, and high-falutin' and self-indulgent.  But it's one the 
things that matters to me in the context of the story.

     C4 can't repeat the show in widescreen, because it hasn't been 
delivered in that fashion, it'd require going back to the original 
wide negatives; but they are negotiating to show season 3 that way 
(Germany and France have already signed on for that).

<I was right!!!
Kosh is an angelic/christian image.

can be revealed within this show.....>

     Actually, no, not really; Kosh is what you see when you look at 
him. And if a Drazi looks at him, the Drazi sees something different 
than a Minbari; yes, a being of light, BUT....

     Is that what they actually ARE, or how they have programmed us 
to react when we see them?  As Sheridan said, have we been *manipulated* 
to seeing them a certain way, seeing a certain image?  We may not be
seeing what they ARE, but what they WANT us to see.

     It goes a heck of a lot deeper than what it seems.

<>Kosh is what you see when you look at him.

when are the laserdiscs due to be released.>

     Yes, there would be some amount of variation among humans, though not 
in terms of beliefs that may have come along post-Vorlon influence.  This 
sort of thing has been implanted almost at a genetic level, and they do 
have a hand, or a mind, in activating it when seen.  The more people who see 
them in different ways, the longer they must maintain that, the greater the 
strain on them.

     And someday, some happy, distant day, we do hope to have widescreen 
laser disks, but that day is not yet in sight.

     Since "The Fall of Night" has now aired in the UK, and word is getting 
out, herewith a post I left on GEnie about Kosh's now-revealed identity.  
I thought it came out fairly well, so I'm repeating it here.

*****

      Okay.  Here it is.  I'm gonna do it.  I'm gonna reveal Kosh.

      I'm not kidding.  Bail now if you're looking in and don't want to 
know.




     No backsies.





     I mean it.




     Last chance.

     Okay, this is it.

     "If he leaves his encounter suit, he will be recognized."  
     "By who?" 
     "Everyone."

     "The First Ones taught the younger races, explored beyond the rim, 
built civilizations...."

     Kosh is what you're pointing at when you say "That's Kosh."

     "Yes, the Vorlons have been to Earth, the Vorlons have been everywhere. 
The Vorlons *are*."

     They *are*.

     "For centuries, the Vorlons have helped the younger races, guiding us, 
and --"   "And manipulating us?"  "It is, as you say, a matter...
of perspective."

     They *are*...a matter of perspective.

     Each race who sees them, sees something out of their own past, their 
own legends, religions, faiths.  A being of light, if you will, but a Drazi 
sees the Drazi version of that, Droshalla; the Minbari see the Minbari 
version of that, Valeria; humans see a human version of that.

     It is the mirror in which we see our beliefs reflected, but is it 
the progenitor of those beliefs...or an implanted image that overlays that 
vision on top of the true form of the Vorlon?  Is it revelation, or is it 
manipulation?

     The Vorlons are a cypher.  The Vorlons are a matter of perspective. 
The Vorlons are guides...or users, emissaries or puppeteers, who wish 
to be seen a certain way, so that we will react properly.

     Is this good, or is this bad?

     And the truth is, even though you have seen a Vorlon, have you seen 
THE Vorlon, the one behind the image that dances somewhere between your 
optic nerve and your brain?

     Or to quote a message I left long ago, paraphrased from memory, 
"The hand Sinclair sees is not the hand Sinclair sees, and the hand Sinclair 
sees is not the same hand someone else in the room sees, and is not even the 
hand that that person sees."

     The Vorlons Are.

                                                                 jms

<My impression of Kosh was one of relative weakness. I increasingly get the 
feeling that Kosh is indecisive and weak. Kosh allowed himself to be poisoned 
by a Minbari and, we assume, be attacked by Morden. He needed Sebastian to 
determine the motives of Delenn and Sheridan and a Vicar to probe Talia, and
here he needed Delenn to convince him to take action. He seems to use everyone
else but seldom does anything himself. Here he demonstrated the ability to fly
and somehow misdirect those watching. There might have been several ways a 
metaphysically-enlightened being could have resolved the situation without 
revealing himself. I assume that, for example Ironheart, could have done 
something with a simple thought.

I suppose I do find Kosh slighty "rightous" for my taste.>

     Actually, the "snitch" was the C&C tech, NOT the pilot, they just 
have a somewhat similar appearance.

     We've established that klaxons go off elsewhere in the station 
during an attack to warn civilians, but they aren't going off in C&C 
because they make it impossible to concentrate, as per military tradition 
(see "And Now For a Word" to confirm this).

     There wasn't time to call Draal, and they can't begin relying on him 
for every problem; they have to be able to hold their own.  You would only 
bring in Draal on something really major.

      Yeah, I kinda figured that recorders like this would be outfitted with a

got lost, and track as long as possible what happened after the log was

Ironheart claimed he could do something similar, and he was part of an

     Yes, the camera was still mounted on the Starfury, but cameras even 
today are constantly transmitting to other locations; TV cameras don't 
just transmit on a cable to the box they're attached to, they are uplinked 
to other places.  Similarly, the recording device continued to receive 
transmission fro the Starfury until such time as it either went out of 
range or, in this case, the transmitter was destroyed.

<Back when you were over here for the Babcom '95 con, you showed us a 
tape including some goodies from forthcoming episodes. The only one 
which we haven't seen in the Last Four [tm] appeared to show Vir falling 
from a great height, which caused considerable anguish and discussion 
amongst Vir-fans.>

     That was from a scene we cut from an episode.

<I have some questions as well.  It seems that Ironheart should have 
picked up on the hidden personality inside Talia's psyche.

 It seems that Talia was basicly a good person.  Which of her personalities 
was the construct, Talia or Control?>

     Control was the construct.  The alternate personality was dormant at the 
time Ironheart was there.

<>> Control was the construct.  The alternate personality was dormant at

I have been thinking about this. It seems to me that one would not just 
*construct* a personality, you would have to have a starting point. 
Was the new personality formed from Talia to begin with? Is the new 
personalities name Isabella?>

     I'd rather let this aspect slide for the moment.

<I have only one burning question - that scene with Delenn and Sheridan 
in the garden, where they're discussing the gaps in her vocabulary... was 
that by any chance inspired by the long-running thread here about that 
portion of Mira's anatomy? <g>>

     No, the scene just came out of looking to have some fun with 
language.

     Nope, no such scene was cut.  It's just a slightly awkward

And yes, we'll definitely be seeing him again.  (We first met him in 
"A Voice in the Wilderness.")

<First, the important stuff<g>-Did Ann Bruice get married?  I 
noticed an additional name on her credit.

All the spoilers I read didn't make much of this exchange:

Delenn:...unless the Vorlons were prepared to stand against them.
Sheridan: Are they?
Delenn: I do not think so.

That scared the h*ll out of me.  Does this mean the Vorlons won't 
help against the shadows? If so, we're in deep trouble.

The SFX was great, including the shuttle effects.  Can't wait for 
season three.>

     Yes, Anne got married.  As for the Vorlons line..."prepared" 
should be taken in the same sense as "ready"...so they may not yet be 
ready.

     Definite agreement on the shuttle sequence, works nicely.

<I just caught TLTS and I just wanted to thank you for staging a space 
battle between two opposing fleets instead of just two ships.  And for 
having the ships engage at a distance too great for them to all fit on 
the TV screen at the same time.  You have once again raised the bar on 
TV SF.>

     Thanks.  One of the things I wanted to try was to find a way to stage 
long-range combat. One of the things everyone says is that even though real 
aerial combat tends to be at great distance -- and space combat would be 
conducted over thousands of kilometers, you probably wouldn't be able to even 
SEE your opponent at that range, just pick up the enemy ships on your scanners 
-- you can't do that for TV because you need to have both in frame, 
hammering each other short-range, to make it work for viewers.

     But I've always liked a challenge, so I thought I'd see if I could make 
it work.  The two sides are, as noted, thousands of kilometers apart, and take 
most of that sequences just to catch up with each other.  And frankly, I think 
it's probably one of the most dynamic battle sequences we've ever done, so you 
can expect more in the future, now that I've kind of got the hang of how to 
do this.

                                                                   jms

<The Narns fire an energy mine of some sort.  Was I seeing things,
or did the Shadow ships "phase" out and then back in to avoid the
brunt of this attack??  If so, it was a VERY interesting maneuver.>

     No, they didn't phase out so much as absorb the energy, 
at cost of great pain.
