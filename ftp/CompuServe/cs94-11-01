BABYLON 5: THANK YOU JMS
DATE: FRI OCT 28, 1994 12:21:12 AM #12187

     It will definitely do; thank you for your kind words.
They (and all the others noted here) mean a lot.  There were
many times, over the five years we worked to sell B5, that we
thought it would never happen; that I was told to just forget
it, move on; that I could've sold 3 other series in the same
amount of time and made big bucks.  But there was a story that
I needed to tell.  And there have been times of great doubt,
if it would all come together; tough times in particular when
the pilot first aired, and in between that and the first season.
Then you do the best you can, and you begin to wonder if anyone
will ever notice, or care; with the snipes in the trades and
the magazines, you start to wonder if you're crazy.

     Very few people *really* understand what goes into the making
of this show, the care and dedication, and the years it took to
get this on the screen.  It is nothing less than a labor of love
*for the genre*, which is very important to all of us who work on
Babylon 5.

     Thanks.  Overseeing the audio mix are me, John Copeland and
George Johnsen, and the latter in particular is a REAL perfectionist.
We try to use the surround channels to heighten certain effects,
because frankly, we all have killer systems, and WE want to hear it.

BABYLON 5: B5 SOUNDTRACK @ LOSCON
TO: ALL
DATE: TUES NOV 1 1994 8:56:21 #16172

     I'm pleased to announce that Christopher Franke's soundtrack
for BABYLON 5 will be available starting around December in most
markets (a great stocking stuffer).  In addition, a LIMITED EDITION
version, which I'm told will be different from the mass release
version, will be for sale at LosCon in Los Angeles over the
Thanksgiving weekend.  I think only about 500 or 1,000 will be
avilable there, and I expect they'll be grabbed up pretty fast.

     (If those here involved with LosCon could get me about fifteen
minutes of open room prior to the start of my Sunday presentation,
I could play about 15 minutes of the CD, assuming a player is
available and hooked up.)

     It is, by the way, a *beautiful* album.  Chris has done
something quite extraordinary, in that instead of a series of
cuts and snippets, like most soundtracks, he's reorchestrated
all the primary themes in the show into one long symphonic piece.
It's gorgeous and rich and full, non-stop for the length of the CD.
I received an early prototype, and have it on almost constantly
while I'm working.  Never get tired of it.

     (I also just did the liner notes for the album, I'm that
excited about it.)

BABYLON THE BOOK #14707
DATE: MON OCT 31, 1994 2:29:13 AM

     For a while, back a few years ago, when I was working on the
new Twilight Zone, our offices were just a few blocks away from a
B. Dalton Booksellers, which was across the street from the local
Scientology HQ.

     Whenever a load of books came into the store, one of the clerks
there told me, they'd come in from across the street and buy them
en masse, to keep the book high on the selling charts.  In a few
cases, he said, the new boxes of books had B. Dalton price stickers
on the covers...meaning they took the purchased books inside,
repackaged them, sent them back to the distributing warehouse, which
sent them back to the stores again.

                                                                   jms

BABYLON 5: SCREW-UP
DATE: TUES OCT 25, 1994 3:12:23 PM #9737

     Well, we tracked down more on the screw-up, and that's how
the "To be continued" got in, and there's a second composite shot
missing (from the DownBelow area).  We rousted our post production
people out of bed last night, and at 3:30 a.m. had them correcting
the mistakes made by others, reassembling the entire episode.  The
correct version is going out on the bird today, tomorrow, and
tomorrow night.  It will also be hand-delivered to KCOP here in town
to make sure they get it.

     I encourage anyone who saw "Chrysalis" over the last day or so
to look at it again on the rerun; I think you'll find parts of it
much better.

     This has been a complete and utter meltdown, and we're all out
for blood at the moment.

HUMANS PLACE IN THE GALAXY
DATE: TUES NOV 1 1994 3:30:22 #15915

     Basically, I think our strength comes, and will come, from
the fact that we are (in my universe-view, at any rate) the only
species that really tends to build *communities* of diverse groups,
humans and aliens, whereas the other species tend to either
congregate only with their own kind, or conquer, rather than form
communities which, in the long run, become stronger than the sum of
their parts.

I like the sense that, okay, the *incidents* of the story are over,
but life goes on, and there are things yet to delve into, how
the events we've just seen AFFECT our characters.  Sometimes we put
major information into the tags, so they're not throwaways; sometimes
we just treat them for fun, or for some nice character moments.

     Londo is a fascinating character to write; there's layers
upon layers, and every time I sit down to write him, he surprises
me with something else. And it's certainly more interesting to
watch someone you like falling into something terrible than to
set up a bad guy from day one; no complexity or sympathy there.
It's kind of like watching an accident in slow motion.  But in
the final analysis, all is not dark for Londo.

     Peter's having the time of his life.  He loves where his

play...I saw him for a bit on the set today, shooting "Soul Mates,"

Lois Nettleton, Jane Carr and Blair Valk as his three wives).

     Basically, yes, the characters are real for me.  Having created
all of them, I'm essentially in the position of having Londo, G'Kar,
Kosh, Delenn, Garibaldi, Ivanova and all the rest chasing each other
in circles through my head 24 hours a day...which may explain a lot.

     Usually, when I put one of my characters into a situation, I
pretty much know how they're going to respond, though sometimes they
surprise me. I took very much to heart Mark Twain's advice that you
should never sit down to write a scene until you have finished it to
your satisfaction; as a result, I "play" the scene over and over in
my head, sometimes a dozen times or more, until I can see it clearly
from start to finish, THEN I write it down.

     It is strange sometimes to read other writers writing my
characters; sometimes they get it, sometimes they don't.  But
realistically, you can't expect other people to write someone you
gave birth to with the same degree of familiarity that you bring,
and that applies to any show.

BABYLON 5: MORDEN'S CLOTHES #16171
DATE: TUES NOV 1, 1994 8:56:19

     Our sensibility is that men's fashions *really* don't change
that much, in the long run (and to a lesser extent, women's). 
Pull out some pictures of the settlers in the 1880s, and you see
button shirts, jeans, shoes, socks, hats...they *really* haven't
altered that much.  Some of the lines, yes, but the silver or
spandex jumpsuits that were predicted in the 1930s for the 1980s
have not materialized.  Form follows function.  People dress in
layers.  So we tend to keep the silhouettes pretty much the same,
but adjust the lines and details.

     (And yes, G'Kar definitely returns in the second season, in a
big way.)

even *encouraged* to come to the set during filming.  (On ST,
freelance writers are generally discouraged or outright forbidden
to visit the set, and even staff writers labor under this.)  The
writer is to be on-set, and if there's a question about a line, if
I or my story editor aren't available, the director is under orders
to take his or her question to the writer for final determination.

BABYLON 5: NEW SEASON
DATE: FRI OCT 28, 1994 8:52:07 PM

     There was a new episode aired a few days ago, "Chrysalis," that
was our season ender, which shows Delenn entering the cocoon and we'll
learn more on why later.

                                                                jms
===============================================
QUESTION #12550: <poster just saw downlink of PtsOD> Why do the
Minbari bear a grudge against Sheridan, a warrior who killed the
enemy while defending his home?
=================================================
BABYLON 5: POINTS OF DEPARTURE
DATE: FRI OCT 28, 1994 8:52:04 PM #12847

     They don't much like the way he did it, which was rather sneaky.
Also, the Minbari do have something of a superiority complex, and that
he got them rankles more than a little.

                                                                jms
DATE: MON OCT 31 1994 2:29:16 AM #14709

     My sense is that the Minbari have something of a superiority
complex; the idea of being beaten, even briefly, by a technically
inferior race is going to grate on them.  Also, bear in mind, that
the military caste has not been fully informed about WHY they were
ordered to surrender...so there's a great deal of animosity just
barely submerged there, which is pointed at the only real human
they know from the war...because he cost them.

                                                               jms
DATE: SUN OCT 30 1994 8:25:04 PM #14441

      Actually, there have been other times we've shown C&C empty,
or nearly empty.  In the first episode, we have Sinclair alone in
C&C the first time we see him, and Garibaldi mentioning that he goes
there when no one's around because it's quiet; also, in "Chrysalis,"
we see Ivanova pretty much alone there, feet up on the console, because
no ships are coming in for now.  So we've established it previously,
just didn't button it down here.

                                                                 jms
DATE: SUN OCT 30 1994 3:53:05 PM #14253

     Well, my thought at the time, and I probably should've put this
into dialogue in retrospect, was that there's a window about every 36
hours when the entire C&C system goes through self-maintainance for
about half an hour, backing things up, doing self-repair, filing logs
with Earth Central, that sort of thing.  They normally pick a slow
period in docking, and any other routine stuff is handled through the
backup C&C on the other side of the station axis (you can see it
directly above the docking bay when the normal C&C is directly below it).

     At first I'd considered putting that in Ivanova's mouth when she
says, "Of all the time he could've picked," but then the reveal of where
he was and what he was doing fell flat; it needed to be a surprise or
it lost its impact and the humor.  Ah, well....

                                                                   jms

     Yes, Delenn's reason for the chrysalis is covered in the next
episode, "Revelations."

     We will be changing the main title sequence after "Revelations"
airs to include the new version of Delenn.  Would be silly of us to
include the new version in episodes prior to her unveiling.

     (Jesus...how many producers will sit down and RE-DO their opening,
with all the expense involved, just for two seconds?  I gotta be nuts.)

     Also touching up a couple of other shots in the opening as well,

      Re: the ever-improving CGI...there's an action scene in the teaser
of the second episode, "Revelations," that is particularly amazing.  And
there is one shot of a Narn ship in extreme close-up toward the end of
the scene that looks absolutely *solid*, and every bit as real and
detailed as any model, and then some.  It cannot be distinguished from
a physical object.

                                                                    jms

     Thanks.  If you think PoD was a "wham," then I can't wait to see
your reaction to "Revelations."

     Interestingly enough, I figured on giving Sheridan a tie to the
Civil War through his ancestor, General Philip Sheridan (sometimes
called "Little Phil" by Lincoln).  Afterward, I discovered that Bruce
is a big civil war buff, so the Lincoln stuff worked very well.

     One of my favorite sequences from this episode is the stuff aboard
the Minbari cruiser during the Battle of the Line; the shots surrounding
Delenn and the other Minbari gives it a very god-like aspect.  Just
wonderful.

                                                                   jms
DATE: MON OCT 31 1994 2:16:19 AM #14700

     Chris did interpolate a little of the Battle of the Line music,
but it couldn't build to a cresendo as originally done because the
musical cue had to continue out through the next scene, and had to
operate under dialogue, so it was more restrained.

     And yes, the EFX are definitely improving even further.

above the tech pit, off to one side, was added for the series.  We've
also added a lot of additional stations and filled stuff in, though,

     We're doing pretty good.  Only complication is that
right now, pretty good (which would've once been nothing
less than wonderful and a guarantee of future seasons)...
is not a guarantee.  First Fox grabbed a bunch of CBS
stations.  Then CBS grabbed a bunch of independent stations
to fill the gap. Then Paramount grabbed some stations, and
now there are VERY few berths left for syndicated shows,
and the only ones who will survive are those that can pull
in BIG ratings.  So we'll see...I'd say that we and every
other syndicated show are right up against the wall just now....

EPISODE LENGTH?
DATE: TUES NOV 1 1994 8:40:00 #16150

     Negative.  ST and B5 have *exactly* the same number
of commercials; the difference is in how we break them up.
The amount of program time is the same.

DATE: THURS NOV 3 1994 11:57:01 #18276

     As I understand it, here's the difference.

     B5: teaser, four acts, tag, then right into the
credits.  You get five commercial breaks from start
of teaser through end of credits.

     ST: teaser and five acts: you get six commercial
breaks before you get the end credits.  So you get fewer
commercials per break, but more breaks. In B5, you get
fewer breaks, but more commercials.

     I believe that our running time is 41:42 total,
with a fairly short opening.  The ST opening title
sequences tend to run longer, which may account for
the difference in time; but the "dry" time (meaning
that spent on story) is pretty much the same.

     Actually, the 5 transition is something that, when
I first discussed it with Kevin Kutchaver, was considered
almost impossible to do because of the elements: it's a
raised etch, which dissolves into a cutaway, then a fade,
then a wipe, all in one continuous move.  (I don't actually
remember whether it was me or Kevin who suggested the move,
or both, so I'll assume it was him for the moment.)  Kevin
had to come up with some real tricks to make this work.

DATE: THURS NOV 3 1994 9:59:22 #18125

     There's a reason for this: due to time constraints,
we have to get Bruce to do the narration *without* having
the images in front of him; he had no way of knowing where
beats would go with the images, or what would be under it
(since we were still putting the new opening together), so
we had to artifically build in pauses when we did the final
transfer (as opposed to year one, where we had the images
assembled long before we had Michael do the narration).
What took forever was that 5 fade/dissolve/wipe, which just
killed us time-wise, but is spiffy to look at.

     Now that it's all together, we plan to have Bruce re-do
the narration with the images in front of him, so he can
respond naturally and make it flow, the way he would've been
able to do had we had the material ready in time.

It was fine, but it could've been better.  Now it is.
Expect it around the same time as the new VO.

     Actually, Kevin works closely with Ron, and many
of the better effects in the show are collaborations.
Nowhere is this more evident than in two episodes to
come, "The Geometry of Shadows" (my personal favorite
of the first six), and "The Long Dark," where they've
done some real landmark work.

     Exactly.  That's something that a lot of folks haven't
noticed (or at least haven't commented upon).  We had to
digitally isolate the moving (sometimes a little, sometimes
a lot) head shot within the larger picture, bring in the
five between that, and frame-by-frame continue the digital
isolation, the fade, and the push-in.  It was a real headache,
but I love the effect, and Kevin did a great job on it.

B5 SOUNDTRACK @ LOSCON
DATE: TUES NOV 1 1994 8:56:21 #16172

     I'm pleased to announce that Christopher Franke's soundtrack
for BABYLON 5 will be available starting around December in most
markets (a great stocking stuffer).  In addition, a LIMITED EDITION
version, which I'm told will be different from the mass release
version, will be for sale at LosCon in Los Angeles over the
Thanksgiving weekend.  I think only about 500 or 1,000 will be
avilable there, and I expect they'll be grabbed up pretty fast.

     (If those here involved with LosCon could get me about fifteen
minutes of open room prior to the start of my Sunday presentation,
I could play about 15 minutes of the CD, assuming a player is
available and hooked up.)

     It is, by the way, a *beautiful* album.  Chris has done
something quite extraordinary, in that instead of a series of
cuts and snippets, like most soundtracks, he's reorchestrated
all the primary themes in the show into one long symphonic piece.
It's gorgeous and rich and full, non-stop for the length of the CD.
I received an early prototype, and have it on almost constantly
while I'm working.  Never get tired of it.

     (I also just did the liner notes for the album, I'm that

     The scores in B5 are done by Christopher Franke,
of Tangerine Dream, working with the Berlin Symphonic
Film Orchestra.  We're *very* happy with the work he's
been doing for us; it's inventive, imaginative, moving
and at times very touching and personal.

     Chris composes here in LA, faxes the score to Berlin,
watches and conducts the orchestra over two-way closed
circuit video over high compression phone lines, they
record it there, the music is then sent digitally back here
over the same high-compression fiber optic lines, and
delivered to us.

     As for how it's determined where music goes...for
every episode, we have a "spotting session," which is
where I get together with Chrisopher, our sound effects
and post-production people, to go over the sound for the
episode.  As part of this, I sit and watch the show with
everyone else, and when I think a music cue is called for,
say, "Music in."  We note the time code on the episode
there, and at the point where I say "Music out."  Chris
then finds the core of the scene, its meaning, and finds
ways to illuminate it through music.

BABYLON 5: POINTS OF DEPARTURE
DATE: THURS NOV 3 1994 4:04:29 #17552

     What you have to understand is that we figured we're going
to be getting a lot of people sampling the show in its first
episode, year two. We were therefore a bit heavy on exposition,
telling rather than showing, because there's so MUCH to tell,
particularly for a new audience.

     If we don't get that new audience, I don't know if
there will be a third season, given how competitive the
marketplace is getting, so we have to be careful how we
bring them in.  Yes, that means explaining a bit more
than long-term viewers have been accustomed to in the first
episode; I think it's a relatively small price to pay.  The
next episode, "Revelations," is really the culmination of
the events of "Chrysalis," and shows more than tells...and
it does a lot of it.

     Yes, you can go in and shoot at a Minbari
*cruiser* visually...but the reality is that any
long-range weapon will be intercepted by targeting
fire, and if you get up real close and personal...
well, actually, you *can't* get up real close and
personal because, as Mitchell learned in "Sky,"
you get shot by the fighters.

     What the fighters tend to remain engaged with
are the Minbari fighters, which are *incredibly*
fast...much too fast to target visually.

     And believe me, as Sheridan stated, Earth's
been *trying* to break the stealth tech for a while,
just hasn't been able to.

     Actually, it was my decision.  The original costume
designer on the pilot asked if I wanted all the fasteners
to be uniform, or if we'd go the traditional way (which
is true of military uniforms today).  I figured, again,
that the key to B5 is more how we're alike than how we're
different, and said to keep it.  We'd've saved some money
if we'd made them all fasten the same way, design-wise,
but it made more sense this way.

     Let me get into this for a second.  A lot of people,
in the beginning, said they didn't see "a lot of depth"
to Sinclair when he first came on the screen, just as you
did with Sheridan.  Later, the majority of these changed
their minds.  Why?  Because you don't get depth from spending
one hour with somebody.  It's like any friendship; after
knowing that friend for several months or years, you don't
ever *see* your friend quite the way you did at first.  You
now have layers of familiarity.

     A number of folks said that they liked how much Michael
had settled into his role by "Infection," only to learn that
that was the first one shot.  It wasn't that Michael had
settled into the role, it was that the audience had finally
settled into Michael.

     We are a nation hooked on instant gratification; an
impatient nation. As with Sinclair, there's a lot of depth
to Sheridan, but you only get to see that, as with any show,
over *time*.

FIRST HUMAN CONTACT

     Sinclair was the first human the Minbari (or at

far for the final victory.  The Earth Explorer vessel
was part of a military fleet that encountered a Minbari
convoy, there was a miscommunication, a misperceived
threat, and our ships opened fire.  There was no
person-to-person contact.

     Thing is, I don't think that those two elements --
the "hard SF standard that (we've) maintained through
season 1," and "the concept of Minbari souls being reborn
as humans" -- are in any real conflict.

     The definition of hard SF is a technical solution to
a technical problem.  But now does that mean that everyone
in the story has to be an atheist?  Not at all.

     You have to separate *hardware* from *people* to make
the SF equation work.  Your hardware has to be as rigorously
based in fact as possible; that's the science part of SF.
But the people have to be people.  And that means that they
will, sometimes, believe things that may seem foolish.  But
that is not a contradiction in the approach.

     Back as far as "Believers," we've always set belief
against science, and generally tried to avoid making ANY
pat statement about either.  Whether or not the part about
souls is true is secondary to whether or not some of the
characters *believe* that it's true.  Some will, some won't.
Will I, as the Old Fart of the Galaxy, say in the series
*THIS* side is correct?  No. My job is to start arguments,
not resolve them.

     It has been established, in prior episodes, that there
are brief periods when C&C is in "standby mode," during which
time no ships are due, the station is in "night" cycle, and
the operational equipment in C&C goes through routine backup
and maintenance.  In "Midnight on the Firing Line," our first
episode, Ivanova is told by Garibaldi that Sinclair is in C&C
when it's in standby mode because he likes the quiet during
those brief periods (usually only about an hour or so); in
"Chrysalis," Ivanova asks Tech 1 if any more ships are due in
for a while, is told no, and she puts her feet up on the console,
watching the news, with the place pretty much deserted.

     This isn't the bridge of a starship; this is mainly a
center of operations for docking and other station activities
requiring command personnel.  Every separate department --
environmental, other resources -- has its own separate control
center, with lots of redundency.

     In addition, there's always somebody monitoring stuff
as it comes through, so if there *were* any kind of problem,
there'd be somebody on site in C&C in thirty seconds.  Basically,
we're talking an hour or so once every 36 to 48 hours.  I
could've explained this in dialogue, but it would've taken the
edge off the revelation and humor, and I figured we'd done this
before enough times that it wouldn't be an issue.

there to be more. The first book, VOICES, is a story featuring
the telepaths, Talia, Bester, Gray, and many more.  In fact,

and a sense that there is something dark and menacing
gliding just beneath the surface, ready to come out at

about this season's graphics that's so much better than
last season's (the folks at Foundation try to explain it
to me, but generally there's math involved, at which
point I get confused and fall down), and I think that
it's the way they've managed to separate the background
from the foreground images.

     Last season, the images were superlative, no
mistake; sometimes, though, they had the sense of
moving matte paintings, more or less all at the
same focal distance.  Now they've somehow been able
to clearly delineate foreground stuff (ships) from
background stuff (nebula/stars), giving it all a
more three-dimensional appearance.

     Or it's pixie dust.

     You're forgetting several elements.

     1) It would be in the VP's best interests to go
along on the trip, to help defuse any suspicion ("Boy,
was I lucky.").

     2) Going a few hours out of the country is one
thing; you're not looking at the aspect that traveling
in normal space takes a lot of time and expense...a
ship as massive as EF1 is hideously expensive; two
would be a major waste of government money, and they'd
both be traveling side by side, further wasting money.
Also, whereas Air Force 1 travels nominally alone, EF1
has a full escort of fighters, with a minimum of four
in the "air" at any one time, plus another batch inside.

     Going between planets is a much different process
than going between here and London; and if both parties
are required at the other end, the only sensible way is
to have them go together.

     The correct phraseology would be, "I'm Captain
Sheridan, commander of Babylon 5."  He is the station
commander, and his rank is captain.

     1) Captain Sheridan will retain command of B5
and not give it over to Ivanova unless he is
off-station.  First, he's the ranking officer.
Second, Earth currently doesn't much care if the
Minbari are mad.

     2) C&C stands for Command and Control.  Since
Sheridan is in command and in control, thus he is
in C&C a lot.  I'm also trying to get Ivanova out
from time to time to explore other aspects of her
character.

     3) No, you wouldn't put someone who's not a
main character making contact with ships because
in many cases, you need a command officer making
decisions.  Routine communications with incoming
ships are already being handled by lower-ranking
officers, the dome techs located in the pit and
around the edges of the dome.

     We have a *lot* of sets...I think 16-20 standing
sets, and something like 59-60 swing sets, more than
just about any other show I can think of.

     As we were making some minor modifications to the
costumes, such as putting some red piping along the
edges, it came up that if you're a qualified fighter
pilot, you generally get wings.  Thus, we added them.

     The chrysalis is virtually all prop, with some roto
work to enhance the glow in "Chrysalis."

     In syndication, it takes a while to get in the final
ratings, because it's aired over the course of a week;
we should know more by this Thursday or Friday.

     Yes, we definitely show the episode titles at the top
of each show, in the first act.  As for introducing a lot
of new aliens, the danger in that is that soon the show
becomes the Alien of the Week, and given where the story
is going, I think it'll be a long time before any of our
current alien characters gets boring.  That can only happen
if the character simply is what he is, and never surprises
you.  Not much chance of that here.

     The Star Wars X-wing fighters are not really efficient
within space; you need something with thrusters on all sides --
front, back, top, bottom -- to facilitate movement along an
XYZ axis.  This is the most sensible, non-aerodynamic version
we could develop.  (We've heard from a number of scientific
types at JPL and Nasa and elsewhere commending us on the

WHITHER ELLISON?

     Harlan's script for us for last season encountered
trouble when he was injured in the earthquake, and other
health problems associated with his heart cropped up.
He is currently working on one now for us.

     Harlan's role on the show is basically under the category
"free floating agent of darkness."  He's free to get involved
with anything he chooses; he can wander into wardrobe (and has
made many useful suggestions there), props (ditto), gives
suggestions to outside writers like David Gerrold and Peter David
and D.C. Fontana, contributed to the narration last year, and
did the closing narration (over end credits) on the show this year.

     Primarily, though, I liken him to Jiminy Cricket, perched
on my shoulder...someone who's been through the wringer (on
Starlost) and can point out the potholes in the road and help me
avoid the same things that caused him grief.

     My brief take on Spielberg: the man is a *terrific*
director.  But he doesn't know what makes a *story*.  He
knows images, knows how to bring your emotions right to
the front, but a story is a very different creature.  When
he has done his best -- Duel, Jaws, Schlinder's List -- he
has always been working from someone else's story.  Whenever
he has personally gotten into the writing process, he slips.

     Take the highly-touted debut episode of "Amazing Stories,"
as an example.  Old man's saying that the Ghost Train is gonna
come by, pick up Grandpa, and take him to the Other Side.  This
is in the very top of the first act.  They talk about this a lot.
Lots of nice shots.  And then, at the end of the episode, the
Ghost Train comes by, picks up Grandpa, and takes him to the Other Side.

     One of the most common errors directors make in trying to
create stories is that they get caught on the image...and as a
result, the stories they become involved with END ON THEIR
PREMISE.  The premise should be where you START, not where you
finish.  This problem has nowhere been more obvious than in the
series work he's been involved with.

     There's no real direction, nothing to *say*, just images and
moments that don't entirely add up.  So they pour money into it
to make it look spiffy.

     I sometimes think what I could do on B5 with the budget of
DS9 or DSV or E2 or ST:V...then, sometimes, I think maybe it's
better this way.  We don't have a lot of money...so we have to
be creative instead.  Works for me.

     The "Be seeing you" is a kind of nod to the Prisoner, yes.

     As for Kosh, when it came time to design the character,
I gave very specific instructions to, first, Peter Ledger
(the artist who did the early conceptions of Kosh for artwork
for the studios), and then our costume designer and prosthetics
people.  I had very detailed elements that had to be included,
given what's inside, so everything kind of had to bend to that.

     The actor wanted to pursue other avenues.  She'd
primarily worked as a romantic lead in films, then came
in at the last minute to help with season one.  She then
wanted to go back to that.  The character stayed because
we need the character to have some prior knowledge of the
situation, rather than bringing in somebody new.

situation where those who've seen basic SF before on the tube
will go, "Oh, okay, I got it...this is the Bad Guy, this is
the Good Guy, this is the Comic Relief, this is the Ally,"
and so on, because that's generally what's been the case in
TV SF; you set up the various sides from day one, and virtually
nobody moves.

     So you get them to rely on their conditioning, then you
begin to move the chairs around, so suddenly what you THOUGHT
was the good guy is maybe something else; and what you THOUGHT
was the comic relief is a tragic and dark figure; and what you
THOUGHT was the bad guy is maybe one of the real heroes of the
story.  And you try and make the path that results in those
changes as interesting, moving, or scary as possible.

     Of course Londo realizes he's being...not exactly set up,
but that he's getting into a very bad situation.  But on the
other hand, he sees that perhaps this is his last chance to
grab for something more than what he is; he's not a young man
anymore, and offers such as this, even though he knows there
will be a price someday (as he states to Morden), do not come
along every day.

     Here is the key to characterization: who is your character,
what does he want, how far will he go to get it, and what is he
prepared to lose in that process?
