knows that this is a game on one level, her comment about just
rewriting the dictionary...she knows the problems aren't *really* gone,
they just defined them away.  But when she's in front of a crowd of

     The padded out area of Centauri males is where their genitalia
(their tentesticles) are located.

     Actually, Centauri have six.  They extend out from the sides of
the body, and "fold" in over the solar plexus when not in, er, use. 
(We actually saw one extended for other purposes in the first season,
"The Quality of Mercy.") Female Centauri have six...er...slotted areas
on either side of the spine, just above the hips, three on either side.

     To go any further would probably bring in the FBI.

     Yeah, the Loki was a little nod, sort of appropriate to who she

     The crew you see on the White Star doesn't reflect those in other
parts of the ship.  Also, being fairly advanced, it doesn't require a
big crew in command.  You could even fly it single-handedly if it came
to that.

     And yes, the historical parallels are definitely there.

     You have to remember that all Garibaldi's people knew was that a
few guys came through the station that may have been involved in the
assassination. That is NOT the same thing as showing that Clark is
involved.  There was no apparent connection.  We the audience suspect
it, from what happens, but until now there has been no evidence of it. 
So yes, they know that Santiago is dead; that there's some indication
that he may have been assassinated...but that's a long way from
pointing to Clark.

     With Clark removing all the evidence, and others giving orders to
drop it, and knowing Clark would stop any kind of investigation, what
is there for them to do officially?  They had to begin working covertly
to prove it, which is what they've been doing ever since "Hunter,
Prey."  If you're a military officer, and you're given a direct order
from your commander in chief or the Senate Oversight Committee to drop
something, and you violate those orders, you're up on charges or fired.

     Yes.  For instance, you're a star, and you say, "I want my name
to appear before the title."  So the next star says "Well, then I want
mine right after the title."  Editors' credits have to go in a specific
place in relation to the title.  And so on.  It's to help avoid
problems of dumping people's credits where they won't be seen.

     If you're talking about the conference room scene...Draal wasn't
put into the scene digitally.  You do a split screen, with the camera
locked off.  In one Delenn walks over to a point just short of the
line; in another you get a shot just of the wall; then Draal walks up. 
You then use a dissolve technique to fade him into the room on his side
of the split screen.  But he's not being put *into* the room, he's
already there, so he's neither bigger nor smaller than he is in real
life, since he IS in real life there, not added in.

     Randy, I honestly don't think, after episodes 8-10 have aired,
that you're going to have any problems with how fast the main story is
progressing. And do bear in mind that the "main story" isn't just the
war; if you wanted to do that, you'd just do Space A&B.  It's operating
on a whole lot of other levels.  Nonetheless...this entire season is
much faster overall in developing than the two before.  The first two
seasons we were mainly putting the guns into position.  Now we're
pulling all the triggers.

                                                                  jms

      It takes us no longer to make the episodes or the EFX really
than it did before.  But PTEN will not air shows out of sweeps periods,
for the most part. The episodes on hand now were finished weeks, and in
a couple of cases over a month ago.  They sit on the shelf until PTEN
decides to air them.  The only thing we did was swap "VoA" with
"Passing Through Gethsemane" to give that one a little bit more time. 
That's it.

     Correct.  There's a certain number of stations you have to have

if you go into Europe, you find people holding grudges 500 years old,

     We'll approach McGoohan when we have a script good enough for his
skills.

     RE: Bester...thanks.  I'd decided a while ago that the next time
we saw him, he either had to win, or he had to be right.  If he lost
again, it'd cut his credibility out.  This gave me a chance to do some
interesting things with him.  He's a fascinating guy...a creep, and I
wouldn't trust him for a second, but fascinating nonetheless....

     We shot two plates, first with him in the machine, then him out,
never moving the camera, so it matched exactly.

      You're right about the shadow war, in many senses.  The story of
B5 is the story of B5 and its people, not the shadow war, which is a
*part* of that story but not the whole of it.  (Remember, it wasn't
even mentioned in the first season.)  If it's just about a war, any
war, then something's wrong. There has to be more to it.

     What you have to understand is that virtually all of the items
you list are generic tools used in great mythic sagas.  A lone group
with great responsibilities, a dark force gathering strength, defenders
of light, beings of great power who are inscrutable or difficult...the
names change but the archetypes remain.  Tolkein used those archetypes,
as I'm using them, as other writers have used them.  Consequently, you
see in this show whichever myth-cycle you're most familiar with.

                                                                  jms

     Correct.  The widescreen footage used in the titles is exactly

that they're the same.

     You fire your weapons (missiles, other stuff) not necessarily at
the same moment, but so that it all *hits* at the same time.  Time is a
factor for the arrival at the target.  Hence, time on target.

      "Dust to Dust" is what I call one of my "pretty box" episodes. 
I set down the pretty box in front of you, and you think you know what
it is. Then something else entirely jumps out of it at your face.

{original post had no questions}

     Your friend should learn a few things from history.  Your friend
should learn that virtually everything the Political Officer said was
taken, in one form or another, from actual speeches from people like
Goerring and Goebbels and Hitler and McCarthy and other members of the
House Unamerican Activities Committee, stated right out in public. 
Your friend should learn that some epidodes are meant to be lighter,
some darker, because you can't have despair, sturm und drang every
episode or you're going to lose viewers left, right and center.  Your
friend should learn to speak for himself.  You should stop hiding
behind "your friend's" comments.

     That "your friend" doesn't like something doesn't make it bad,
any more than liking something makes it good.  Your friend should learn
that the universe does not revolve around his opinion.  Your friend
should try writing something, and selling it, before he sets out to
tell a writer the "better ways" that writer should be telling his
stories.  Your friend seems to think that unless it's done *his* way,
the "better way," then it's not good.

     "jms...not having the time to find better solutions to each
scene."  I had plenty of time to find solutions to each scene.  I chose
the solutions that I liked.  And that most folks seem to have liked. 
Again, if your friend would've chosen a different way, then it's your
friend's story, not mine, and it's not "better."  Because I don't
happen to tell my story the way your friend wants to tell a story
doesn't make his "better."

     So I guess all the people who enjoyed VoA, who enjoyed the
dialogue, who laughed out loud at all the right places, who liked
it...they're all fools and idiots because your friend says otherwise,
huh?  Because clearly it's *bad*. No subjective opinions here, your
friend says it's bad, well, then, by golly, it's bad...and the rest of
the viewership is just plain dumb not to perceive it.

     "Your friend" has clearly never been through a writing workshop,
or learned how to present constructive criticism.  It's his way or the
highway.

     When "your friend" has written 145 produced television scripts,
and been nominated for multiple writing awards, written columns and
books on scriptwriting, *then* he can tell me the "BETTER" way to
write.  Meanwhile, if he has logical concerns, questions, flaws to
point out, mistakes that were made, I'm happy to hear them.  But anyone
who sits there and says that he knows the *better* way to do
everything, because his way IS the better way, and if it's not done HIS
way then it's wrong...doesn't have the first idea what the hell he's
talking about.

                                                                  jms

     The shot as filmed wasn't locked down (locked camera), and they
had to take the film and carefully insert the material so it wouldn't
look jumpy.

      Ivanova wanted to get in the face of the First Ones, to say,
"Look, you can blow me away, but damn it, listen to me."  If she'd said
that "more reverently," as your friend noted, it would've worked
against the logic of the scene and the resolution.

     (Also, the political officer never "stormed into Sheridan's
office." She was waiting there, quite demurely, as he entered.  So
again, when he says that his complaint is "with Sheridan's lack of
response when the political officer stormed into his office," and that
never happened in the first place, you can understand why I might have
a problem with this.)

      Yeah, everyone turned in great performances in this one, very
intense and layered.  And as a result of G'Kar's attack, the next
several episodes will find him still in prison.  In the B5 universe,
you don't just go in for a long time at the end of an ep and next thing
you're out again.  He has to serve his time, and now we'll see him in a
cell for a while.

      And yes, you'll learn more about what happened to the Narn
telepaths in coming months.

      She didn't say that she was from the "B5 advisory council."  She
said that she had been dispatched by the Senate Oversight Committee,
which as we have established before, has jurisdiction in many ways over
B5.

      This is the difference between TV logic and Real logic.  In TV
logic, yeah, she should've tossed her outta there...but we try to be
rigorously real about the B5 universe.  She was sent by the Senate
Oversight Committee, as is their province, with the backing of several
governmental offices, in an area over which Sheridan doesn't have
jusrisdiction: the political arena back home. In the real world, you
can't just toss somebody out the door because you don't like them...not
if you're a career military officer who answers to a civilian authority
or government.

     "...didn't seem to announce her authority well enough...the
Babylon 5 Advisory Council...."

      Once again, as I noted elsewhere, this is NOT what she said, she
specifically noted that this was from the Earth SENATE.  How much does
one need to explain the senate?  (Jokes aside.)  As it was, that scene
went about 2 full minutes of carefully balanced exposition...more, to
explain the senate, when we've been seeing senators all three years is
silly.  It WAS announced well enough.

     One simply has to pay attention.  Thus far, the "better ways"
have struck out consistently.  Most have been based on totally
incorrect perceptions of what was said or done in the episode; the
others are matters of personal taste that are, frankly, just lateral
moves.  Most, again, are simply from not paying attention.

     There's a great story about the first time Van Gogh met Gaugain,
his role model.  Gaugain looked at Vah Gogh's paintings, which had been
hung on all the walls for his inspection, and after a moment announced,
"You paint too fast."

     To which Van Gogh replied, "No, you LOOK too fast."

     Take the lesson for what it's worth.

       Thanks.

       Implying more than one sees is something that you kinda have to
learn over time.  It can be very effective, as here.

       You just have to kinda put yourself out on a limb, as a writer
or as an actor.

       This scene *should* be very affecting.  It goes to Joe's Theory
of Violence on TV.  To wit...that we need more of it, but it has to be
realistic violence.  It has to show consequences.  You glorify or
desensitize violence when you shoot somebody, and they just go down, no
yelling in pain, no sobbing as their guts fall out onto the street. 
It's just gunfire, loud noises, excitement and fun.  If you're going to
show violence, then show it for what it *is*, and show it the way
people would react to it.  Make the audience understand that this is a
*person*, not one in a series of body counts.

       (There's also Joe's Theory of Button-Fly Jeans, btw...which
holds that when you use the men's room, you only actually *have* to
unbutton the first three buttons...the fourth one is just for show.)

     He's still wrong.  She was waiting, demurely, when Sheridan
entered. The argument didn't start until well afterward.  Tell him to
run the episode again and maybe LOOK at it this time.

     Second comment...I suspect that Hank has a problem with women. 
His concerns repeatedly are with the women characters, that they're too
much in your face, that they're not reverential enough, that they're
"pushy," doesn't like that they can be sexually aggressive.

     In short...the problem may not be the show....

     Also, the statment "a Fox network series" is incorrect; some Fox

     Generally speaking, in television, if you're not going to see

folks new to the show won't know what you're talking about.  Those who

       Phil...I get this at the start of every season.  Let me repeat
what I've said, oh, about two dozen times already before.

       At the start of every season, we have new people sampling the
show. Do you want the show to continue?  If you do, then you have to
continue to add new viewers.  If viewers tune in and they're lost in
the overall arc, they're going to tune out again.  So you give them
some stand-alone episodes in the beginning, shows that are a little
more accessible, but introduce them to the characters, the situations
and the universe so that when the arc begins to move again, they know
enough to get into what's going on.

       Sure, I could've just kept going right with the strong arc
episodes. Which the new viewers, 90% of whom sample shows in the first
few weeks of a new season and not thereafter, wouldn't have been able
to follow well.  And they would've tuned out.  And it would've been a
very big nail in the cancellation coffin.  You can bring in new
viewers, or you can get canceled and never tell the whole story.  Pick
one.

       Second, you cannot -- CANNOT -- sustain the kind of intensity
you have in the final four over the course of a season.  You need to
have some lighter moments as contrast or people are going to start
sticking their heads in ovens all across the country.  So at the start
of a season, I try to do some lighter stuff, to bring people back up a
little, bracing for the next drop in the roller coaster.  You need
peaks and valleys to develop any kind of rhythm, or to appreciate the
other side of it.

       I got the same thing in season one, and season two..."Why these
light episodes?  What's happened to this arc?"  Then by season's end,
the chorus usually turns to "That was a GREAT season!"  So my response
is, Unless you think I've suddenly turned stupid, or I've decided to
betray the series I've now worked 10 years of my life to produce...will
you for chrissakes *trust* me once in a while?  Show a little patience.
When I introduced Vir, everybody on the planet jumped funky all over
me.  "He's just a comic character!  It's Flounder!  He's dumbing down
the show!  Space him!  He stinks!  Joe's losing it!"  And now, of
course, we see what Vir is, and in many surveys he's now one of the
most popular characters.

       You know what the #1 comment from the pilot was, on the nets
and elsewhere?  "LOSE the guy with the funny hair!  He's just
ridiculous." Londo. Every time I've done something a little different
in the show, I've usually been jumped on, because they're not willing
to trust that I know what I'm doing...until they've seen it for a
while, then they Get It, and it's "Oh, now I see it."  Great, thanks,
now that you've been beating on my head for six months.  Next time show
a little patience.  (And btw, ALL of the comments related above are
real ones, many of them right here on Compuserve, from people still
around here.)

       Every story can't be an arc story at this point; you've got to
see the characters outside the arc, in the way they live their lives,
in other things that happen to them, or else you won't CARE what
happens to them in the arc. No, the Purple/Green Drazi story didn't
move the arc ahead, but it showed you a lot about Ivanova, didn't it? 
So now if and when something should happen to her in the arc, you care
about her.  It's the difference between just being chess pieces, and
being *people*.

       Okay, here's the breakdown.  Season 3.  You had arc episodes
only a bit in the first batch.  "Honor," "Voices" and now a little in
"Dust." You've got one more stand-alone next week, "Exogenesis." 
That's the last one for a LONG time.  Episodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15,
16, 17, 20, 21 and 22 are ALL arc stories, most of them heavy, none
less than moderate.

       I said, from the start, that each season would have
stand-alones and arc stories.  About 20% in year one, 35% in year two,
50% in year three, 70% in year four, and 100% in year five.  And the
stand-alones tend to get pushed toward the beginning of a season for
the reasons stated.  Is nobody paying attention when I say these
things?  Because if so, then why do I get gigged each season at the
start by people saying "HEY!  HOW COME THESE AREN'T ARC EPISODES?" 
(And as it looks now, year 3 has closer to 13-14 arc episodes, so we're
ahead a bit.)

       Before people start making sweeping generalizations about the
season, it might behoove you to see the season first.  If anything, my
concern in looking at what's been done for year 3 is that we're too
GRIM for the larger portion of it, and maybe a bit complex...so I'm
working to clarify a few things here and there as I do these last few.

       So that's my response to the generalizations.  To the
specifics....

       The political officer: improbable dialogue?  Most of it was
taken direct from political statements, public ones, made by Goebbels,
Hitler, Joseph McCarthy, Stalin, and other fanatics.  The kind of Big
Lie dialogue people continue to fall for today.  Go to a Pat Buchanan
rally sometime and tell me it's unlikely dialogue.

       The chess maneuver: I mainly get this comment from people who
don't play chess much.  I used to be a decent (not great, but decent)
player, and I fell for a move out of left field sometimes.  (I'm a
sucker for a fool's mate.)  Sheridan isn't a chess master, he's still
rough around the edges, and Theo's been doing this a lot longer.  He
got foxed.  It happens.

       "Marcus, the walking cliche."  Heard this about Vir, Zack,
Morden, Londo, and others.  My prediction: by season's end, Marcus will
be one of our more popular characters.  Because you haven't seen all of
what he is yet.  Any more than you did Vir on his first two
appearances.

       (Y'know, there are days I hate the american culture of
immediate gratification and kneejerk condemnation and stereotyping with
insufficient information.  So far there hasn't been an uninteresting
character in the lot. Do you think suddenly I'm going to introduce a
lox?  Okay, Keffer wasn't all he could've been, but that was because
that character was always doomed, and doomed to go fast, so I think I
put a little distance between myself and him. That doesn't apply here. 
I said Vir was a great character, and some folks snorted and made fun. 
I was proven right.  So trust me, Marcus is a great character.)

       The two small story points...like I said, I went for a lighter
touch in "Voices," because it was the last chance to have some light
moments for a long, long, time.

       The White Star was so named as a balance to the Black Star,
which Sheridan destroyed.  What here is a problem?

       I don't mean to rag on you, Phil...I know your interests are
only the best.  But (expletive) it...y'know?  I was real patient the
first time I went through this at the top of season one, patient again
at the top of season two...and it's just wearing a bit thin.  If I knew
what I was doing then, why should I suddenly not know what I'm doing
now?  How many times over do I have to prove myself, and this series? 
It seems like everything good I did in the season before gets forgotten
because we just take a BREATH before moving on to the next stage.  And
then suddenly it's "The sky is falling!  The show's falling apart!  The
arc is gone!  Ohmygodohmygod!"

       Patience, people.  I've been faithful, and honest, and straight
with all of you.  I haven't let you down yet.  And I don't intend to. 
Season three collectively represents the very best work we have done on
this show to date. Starting with #8, "Messages From Earth," the arc and
the story kicks into high gear, moving faster than ever before.  MAJOR
stuff happens.

       And natch, I'll go through this all over again in year four,
because they'll say it doesn't move as fast as year three did.  You
can't win.  I appreciate the concern, Phil.  Honest I do.  But I've
always had a problem with people judging the season on a sampling. 
Give it a chance.

     Thanks.  I really think this season is just overall such a leap
over the previous season, especially once episodes 8-10 hit.  As it
happens, I showed a bit from 8 to some folks in the office the other
day, one in particular being a fan of the show who sat in on an
interview...to say their jaws were on the floor doesn't *begin* to

     Basically, like many manipulative people, she projects whatever
she thinks will work best with her audience.  Appealing to Zack's
patriotism, trying to find Sheridan's affections by flattering him
mercilessly (on many levels), playing the straight-chinned leader in an
address to security forces...she puts on whatever face she thinks will
work.

       Yes, it helps if the person's mind is in a different state --
asleep, exhausted, in a heightened state of awareness -- for the
Vorlons to make contact, which is why their presence is often
associated with dream imagery.

Subject: B5 Sound

{original post had no questions}

     The sources of the problem are two-fold, and we keep trying to
get it straightened out.  When we deliver the episodes to WB, the sound
level is where it should be.  Then we watch the show and the levels are
a lot lower, and there's some phasing going on.  As near as we can
determine, at some point after we've turned over the episode, when
multiple levels of dubs are being made (for closed captioning, another
for national spots to be inserted, and so on), the audio goes from
digital to analog and back again. In addition, some stations tend to
clamp our audio, but run the commercials hot.  We're working to find
out where this is happening and stop it.

                                                                  jms

     Never said that the shadow war ends this season.  I simply said
it wouldn't run all the rest of the series.  And even when a war is
over, the afteraffects can be felt for some time.  And there may be
related problems still to clean up.

     Neither the Ikarrans nor those on Epsilon 3 were First Ones.  And
the level of tech between Vorlons, Shadows and Walkers is fairly close.

     No, insofar as I have been able to determine, in the history of
TV no one has ever written every episode of a season of a dramatic
series single handedly.  The closest would be Terry Nation, who wrote
the first season of Blake's 7, but that was only 13 episodes, not 22.

     As for what folks say about me...probably it's all of those you

       In defense of Phil...who I have spoken with before, and met
once, and who asked his question in good faith and I kinda handed him
his head...don't take my reaction necessarily as venue to jump on him. 
Some days, when I've been working 18 hours straight on the show, I come
across a comment that puts me into Wet Cat mode.  That was one.  Which
is why I made a point of trying to say that I understand the
question(s), and whence they proceed.

       There are a very few flakes and idiots and dangerous loonies
out there in net-land...but Phil isn't one of them.  It's the
consistent idiots you have to watch out for.

       Re: the discussion group...this is one of the things that I've
decided I'm very proud of, regarding B5.  Delenn pointed out that
humans form communities; it's what we do.  And a B5 community has
arisen.  Fans of the show gather in pizza parlors to watch the show,
set out open invitations for picnics and house parties to catch shows
off the satellite, create discussion groups...form communities.  People
have formed lasting friendships, regular pub groups, even gotten
married because of the show.

       Others have gotten involved in social work, contributed or
worked for charities, food kitchens, other causes.  Decided that their
fates are in their own hands, and been inspired to move across the
country to form new lives and pursue what they *want* to do instead of
what they felt they *had* to do.  I hear from them frequently in email,
and in public messages.

       I'm very happy about that.  If Star Trek's shining element was
that it got people involved in the space program, perhaps B5's shining
element is that it gets people involved in the human program.

     Many of us on the show are fans of fighter planes and military
history, especially producer John Copeland.  So we've taken to giving
the Starfuries nose art...in fact, the near-legendary WW II flying
squadron the Flying Tigers actually gave us *permission* to use their
logos on Sheridan's fighter.

     Thanks.  Yeah, Exo is the last non-arc episode for a long time,
and the last chance to catch one's breath before the big fall.

     My personal evaluation of the episode is that it's okay.  The
second half, I think, isn't as strong as the first half.  Halfway
through writing the episode, we had a problem come up in production
that unexpectedly took me away from the script for about a week. 
(Nothing major, but it had to be dealt with and it took time.) 
Usually, I write copious notes on a script before I begin writing it. 
In this case, the story was so crystalline clear in my head that I just
dived in, and was blasting away terrific when the hit came midway 
through.  By the time I got back, I'd lost some of the fingerprints of
the story, and had to kind of re-find them again.  Mainly, I think the
expository sequence at the end could've been done better.

     Needless to say, that's the last time I trusted myself without
notes, no matter how well I "see" the episode in my head.  It'd be a
great script for second or first season, but we have to keep raising
the bar, every aspect has to be better than the last thing we did, so
for my money it's not quite up to that standard.  Happily, it's the
*only* episode this season that I feel that way about...the rest are
all just nifty.

     That said, I think it has some great moments for Marcus, Franklin
and others...and yes, there's a lot more planned with Franklin coming
up this season, particularly toward the latter third of the season.

                                                                  jms

       For what it's worth, if your concern is with the suits, we
haven't had a single writing note from WB since episode 2 or 3 of
season 2.  Not one. Nada.  No nots at all on our cuts of the episodes. 
Nothing.  They completely trust us, and they leave us to tell our
story.

      With some thematic exceptions, most of the music Chris composes
for us each week is unique, and tailored for that episode.  So yes,
it's all mainly new.

      Re: the coat of welcoming...here's a little tidbit...we had to
make up an entire alphabet for most of our major races (and I've been
gradually building up a dictionary here and there for languages).  So
they came and asked if they could embroider something in Minbari on the
shirt Vir's wearing when he comes back.  I said sure.  Did I have
anything in mind?  No, not really.

      So I'm on the set that day, and I see the embroidered shirt, and
I ask what these five letters spell, since I don't offhand read Minbari
yet.  He looked up at me and smiled.  "It spells out ALOHA."

      We have a very demented crew.

       I agree.  We're slowly ratcheting up the tension, and this has
got to take a toll on people.  Franklin probably wouldn't be doing as
many stims as he is otherwise.  Actions have consequences.

       And yes, having seen prior episodes adds more texture.  Still,
one can follow the episode for what it is.  The more you watch, the
more you get out of it.

       No, we can't contract with occasional actors in this fashion,
so we have to book them ahead of time, as soon as a script lands in the
production office.  If they're not available, sometimes we have to do
without and make the character someone else, or juggle episodes so we
can shoot when they are available.

                                                                  jms

{original post had no questions}

       Probably about 120 would be the oldest a human would get; there
hasn't been that much change in that end of it.  The median age,
though, is different, so that right now, the average lifespan is 68
years, I think.  By 2260 you can add another 20 years to that.

                                                                  jms

     "Don't you know better than to try and say something good about a
Trek show in the B5 area?  I'm surprised JMS didn't come flying in here
accusing you of having a sinister agenda and trying to do him personal
harm."

     An interesting comment from you, given that you're addressing
this to Wayne Hall, your brother, so obviously he came in here to leave
the message so you could then respond in this fashion, and thus attack
me.

     Also intresting in light of your comments on AOL, in which you
were the single loudest voice screaming bloody murder whenever B5 was
mentioned in the ST areas, and your repeated request, verging on
demand, that people be prohibited from mentioning B5 at ST conventions,
bitching about the mention of B5 at ST panels, and generally carrying
on cranky whenever the show got any mention at all in a ST folder.

     Whereas, on the other hand, when the B5 page was opened on AOL, I
made it a *point* to make sure that there was a subsidiary section set
aside for the discussion of other TV series, including the variations
of ST, to create a more open environment.

     The problem, as usual with you, Randy, is entirely yours.  You
continue to project onto others your own problems.  You're truly a
pathetic individual.

       From the start, I've indicated that there's a side-story that
could go off in the B5 universe after the 5 year story is up, but it
wouldn't be B5. Frankly, however, given the current state of the
syndication market, I'd suggest that the odds of that happening are
slim and none.

       So barring anything truly exceptional -- like someone handing
me an anthology series -- my plan at the moment is to retire from TV at
the end of the five years and go back to writing novels and plays.  At
that point, I think I'll have said just about everything I want to say
for TV.

       It has come to my attention that someone at Capricon this past
weekend was trying to get fans to buy allegedly "real" B5 costume
elements for as much as $3500, attesting that he has a letter from me
verifying its origins.

       We have never released ANY costumes for sale for any reason,
and I have certainly never written any letter affirming this, or
allowing this. If this letter exists it is certainly a forgery, and
this matter should be turned over to the local police department for
investigation by their fraud and bunko divisions.  If you have had any
contact with these individuals, beware.

to touch passion, not be burned by it, and come back to tell what it

       Well, yes, Randy, I'm sure I responded exactly as you thought I
would. When one exhibits poor behavior in public, one will usually be
corrected.  You came in here and, totally unprovoked, without any
message from me, without even a word from me in the thread, took a
cheap and untrue shot at me, and my behavior.

       When one pokes the bear without *any* justification, except to
do it, well, I suppose it is only natural to expect some kind of
reaction.  If I were to pour a pint of chocolate milk on someone's
floor, I could anticipate their reaction.  But the problem would not be
in the reaction; the problem would be in the ill-mannered, senseless,
stupid and uwnarranted provocation.

       Still, I take this as a sign of growth on your part that you
can now predict the kind of response your generally poor behavior
elicits.  And, as usual, you just dive out of the way instead of
confronting the facts of your past behavior.

       Which is exactly what *I* expected of *you*.

       Symmetry is a wonderful thing, is it not?

       Good news.  We've finally convinced Warner Bros./PTEN to go
with eight new episodes in a row, starting the first week of April. 
The new schedule, which just went out via fax to the stations today, is
as follows:

       So here now is the revised schedule:

       NEW EPISODES:
       2/12    EXOGENESIS
       2/19    MESSAGES FROM EARTH
       2/26    POINT OF NO RETURN              (w/Majel Barrett)

       RERUNS:
       3/4     FALL OF NIGHT
       3/11    THERE ALL THE HONOR LIES
       3/18    AND NOW FOR A WORD
       3/25    IN THE SHADOW OF Z'HA'DUM

       NEW EPISODES:
       4/1     SEVERED DREAMS
       4/8     CEREMONIES OF LIGHT AND DARK
       4/15    SIC TRANSIT VIR
       4/22    A LATE DELIVERY FROM AVALON     (w/Michael York)
       4/29    SHIP OF TEARS                   (w/Walter Koenig)
       5/6     INTERLUDES AND EXAMINATIONS
       5/13    WAR WITHOUT END: PART ONE       (w/Michael O'Hare)
       5/20    WAR WITHOUT END: PART TWO

       We're now in the process of working to get 2 new episodes in
July, so there are only 3 left for October.  Even so, we're very
excited to get a chance to show eight episodes in a row, building up to
the end of the May sweeps with our big two-parter.

{original post had no questions}

       Actually, they did use that kind of technique on some of their
own population.  The medical population, for instance.  Recently
uncovered (and shown on A&E, which I sometimes think is the All Nazi
Network, All Nazis, All the Time) were a series of "informational
films" produced during the war and shown to doctors charged with the
notion of eliminating the insane, the genetically flawed, and others
not classified as jews or gypsies or poles or other non-desirable
races.

       They went through, each film gradually stating their theory
more clearly, and explained that these poor souls weren't *really*
alive, weren't *really* aware.  It systematically showed how it was
better, really, in the lokng run, to put them out of their own, and
society's, misery.

       If it ever comes around again, watch it; it'll chill your soul.

{original post had no questions}

       Next time you're in a bind, btw, you may want to point out to
someone out there that the *head* of the British Sci-Fi Channel, in an
interview, stated that he felt that B5 was the best SF show currently
around.  So if they want to move toward serving the UK population,
where B5 is #6 on the sell-through video charts, they definitely should
do more B5 coverage.

                                                                  jms

       Warners owns the copyright to B5, just as Paramount owns the
copyright to ST.  By contract, if there should be a spin off or sequel
of any kind, I would have to be involved in it.  The contract doesn't
say that there cannot be any of these; you're correct, that can't be
negotiated.

       But there are a number of common-sense things at work here, as
much as anything involving a studio can be described as common sense. 
Given that all our actors/service contracts are deliberately for 5
years not the more traditional 7, continuing B5 per se past year 5
becomes impossible, due to the hideous level of re-negotiation of
contracts that would have to take place. The cost would skyrocket.

       I've always said, from the start, that there's a side story
that could go off after B5 is finished, but I just don't think it's
likely for the time being.  The numbers have been good enough to
continue the show, but it's not a blockbuster, not a
franchise...primarily due to the fact that we don't have a national,
regular timeslot.  (Where we *do* have that, in the overseas markets,
the show is extremely successful.)  There've been some small talks here
and there touching on various feature film possibilities, from 
direct-to-video to something theatrical -- but, again, due to the
corporate structure at the studio, which is straight out of the pre-
Cambrian period, I doubt anything much will happen on that front for
the time begin.  It's nice that they've broached the subject, but to
become a reality takes a bit more.

       If I were to engage in predicting the future, here's what I
think is most probable.  The show will continue to go on, doing well
enough in the ratings to continue for two more seasons.  A comfortable
level.  In 1998, after we've finished our first run, we are
contractually already sold to the TNT cable network, which is
*extremely* excited about the show, plans to promote it, and sees it as
a way of breaking into the SF genre.  There, for the first time, we
will have a regular, *daily* timeslot on a national network.

       Then, I think, suddenly we're going to be "discovered," much
the same way ST was discovered in syndication after it left the
network.  Give it about a year or two for WB to notice this (see
pre-Cambrian comment above), then suddenly they're going to start
running around seeing what they can do to capitalize on this.

       At that point, I'm not sure which way the runes point. 
Certainly they'll start cranking out more merchandise stuff, which by
contract I have to approve, to make sure it's quality stuff.  If they
want to do a feature, I'll have to be involved, and they'll have to
negotiate with all the cast members, who by then will have moved on to
other projects and may or may not be available.  Ditto for any
spinoffs.

       So by the time they get their brains wrapped around the
question, it'll already be the year 2000.  By then, much of TV as we
know it now will have changed considerably, as it has already changed
considerably in just the last 10 years.  A spinoff or sequel may no
longer be financially viable in the new marketplace.  Ditto for any
features.  Certainly nothing much could be done until 2002 or 2003 in
terms of development, pre-production, production and post production.

       So as you can see, one doesn't need a contract saying you can't
do something...in TV, entropy tends to take care of the problem very
nicely.

       Nothing new.  Which is what I figured.  I think they want to
get a sense of the coming renewal situation before talks go any
further.  Which will take another month or so.  Basically, the stations
get pitched all new show pickups at NATPE, then they go home, confer
with their general managers and owners, and then decide finally which
shows they will and won't pick up. We won't hear anything definitive on
that until probably late April, possibly even early May, depending on
circumstances.

       Alas, I would feel inappropriate in referring you to any of our
staff for consultation, as a) they get such requests frequently, and b)
they're very busy on other stuff.  Probably any good makeup technician
in the area could do the same in any event; we're not doing anything
that hasn't been well established in the field.

       Thanks (I think).  Yeah, I've said from the git-go that in my
view the second half of Exo isn't up to the first half.  It is, in my
view, the weakest of this season's 22.  On the flip side, that means
the other 21 are pretty nifty.

       Agree with you on Marcus.  I'm finding I have the same problem
with him I have with Londo...getting him to shut up once I wire him up
and let him go. He's a lot of fun to write, in that he can do the
physical action stuff very well, he can do comedy, more dramatic
emotional stuff...the whole range.  I can take him places and do things
with him that I can't in some ways for the other characters, in that he
has only one responsibility, whereas the others have larger
responsibilities to more people.

                                                                  jms

       Thanks.  Bruce did an excellet job in this episode, I agree. 
As did everyone else.  This is, in my opinion, about as flawless an
episode as we have ever made.  It's one of those cases where the sum is
even greater than the sum of its parts...and the sum of its parts ain't
bad.

       From here on through the next batch, the intensity level
continues to crank up.

       We definitely pushed the envelope in terms of EFX this time
out; mixing and matching, and in sheer amounts of shots, and their
complexity. But the result, I think, is eminently worth the effort.

       Here's something that occured to me today.  Any time you have
someone you're trying to convince about the quality of a show, and you
say, "Here, just watch it next week," that's always the one that comes
a-cropper.

       "Messages From Earth" airing this coming week is possibly the
best thing we've done to that point.  It's guaranteed to grab anybody
who watches it.  So this would be a good one to use.

       Pick ten friends who you know haven't yet tried B5, or are
diffident about it, and give them a call.  Tell them to give THIS one a
look.  Then all you have to do is sit back, and wait for the jaws to
drop.

       Thanks.  Yes, I tend to find *process*...the going from one
state to another, to be interesting.  Growth not only provides drama,
it can often produce irony, tragedy, and comedy, and ah *loves* all of
those.

{original post had no questions}

       If you're looking for rationality here, save your time; these
are the same two, he and his brother, who *insisted* over on AOL that I
had sent official B5 reps to conventions to bash ST...and when
challenged, backpedaled fast...until finally admitting that they saw a
couple of guys on a panel who'd said bad things about ST, but were in
NO way associated with B5 in ANY official capacity whatsoever.  They
basically just made it up.

       He just posted a HUGE and *provable* fabrication about DS9's
ratings over on the ST section, and then has the audacity to come here
and say that *I* speak with a forked tongue.

       They seem to think that somehow I should prevent B5 fans from
ever saying anything derogatory about ST.  I don't have that kind of
control. They said it here again, that I "allow" this behavior.  This
is irrational thinking at its finest, that somehow I control or allow
viewers of this or any show to do or say ANYthing.  Their attitude is
like a cranky child, "Make 'em stop talking bad about our show!"

       Basically, accuracy and the Halls dine at separate tables. 
You're making the same mistake I did at first with the Halls...assuming
that you were dealing with sensible individuals interested in the
facts.  You're not, and they're not.

> Speaking of writing and the like, how is the carpal tunnel doing

       Frankly, the carpal tunnel is not good right now.  Yesterday it
shot up from my left elbow to wrist...it's hard to describe unless you
take a shishkabob skewer and drive it from your elbow to your wrist
real fast a few times.  Mainly it's a dull but constant
weight/discomfort in the wrists, fingers and forearms; the ring finger
of my right hand is now constantly turned inward...I have to sleep on
it flat under my pillow at nights to straighten it out by morning. 
(The left hand just started doing the same thing a few days ago.)

       This is the worst part of the year for this, at this point in
the writing.  Last year at this time, I had to write 20 minutes, then
ice my arms down for 20 minutes, then write 20, then ice 20.  And so
on.  The discomfort is pretty chronic now, but not always as acute,
because I'm doing the exercises, and wearing the wrist restraints, and
doing all the things I should be doing.

       But the bottom line...to write this season means writing over
1,000 pages of scripts in less than 10 months.  Not counting interim
drafts and the like.  That's the equivilent of a novel every 5 months. 
That's going to take a toll on you no matter what you do.  (Dictating
or voice recog doesn't work for me; I write through my fingers.)

       When these last two scripts are finished, though, I'll have a
fair amount of time to recuperate before doing it all over again.

                                                                  jms

       Basically, it's the cost involved in transporting something as
basically trivial as eggs.  Yes, it can be done, but the cost per egg
would be quite substantial, given limited space in ships.  Space flight
is still very expensive.

       And yes, a shadow vessel has one "core" sentient, and once in,
it's very difficult for that person to ever get out again.

echo, or a shadow, so to speak, of his moment in "Honor."  The latter
is meant to sort of indicate what might be ahead for him, what he may
have to do at some point along the line.  He has to give up things that
mean something to him. (We'll get more of this philosophy in a few more

       One of them was; David Gerrold's premise was used for the

the author holds onto ancillary uses, so I can't go around assigning

       Yes, what he's writing will, in time, become the Book of G'Kar.

       And correct, I went for a different feel in this episode, on
the theory that a little change is a good thing, if used to a purpose. 
It's built like a series of waves, with quite moments in between.

       This is the second so far to strongly tie into the comic, yes.

       Thanks.  The stories ebb and flow at different paces, some
slower, some faster, depending on the nature of the story.  I try to
give each one a separate flavor.  Where it may become a hassle is that
some folks, myself included sometimes, tend to flip pages in a novel to
get to the exciting stuff...but the interim parts, though slower, are
where you get to know the characters and care for them, so that what
happens later has consequence.

       The forces will continue to build over the course of this

atmosphere, where it could be picked up by its emissions, the
disruption caused in the air by the engines, and frankly by plain

       No, usually it's not a problem, except when I get physically
tired at the end of a long day.  It's a full-immersion process only
from July through April; from April to June it's a bit slower, so I can
recuperate then (we don't shoot April to June).  I actually have very
little trouble living in the B5 universe with half my brain, and
hanging out here and the other nets with the other half of my brain. 
Granted, I don't have any brain left over for a personal life during
this period, but my personal life has always been pretty brainless, so
there you are.

       Okay, then if gravities is inappropriate, 'splain to how
shuttle and jet pilots refer to gravities in similar situations, e.g.,
pulling 2 g's when at a certain accelleration and turn pattern.

       Also, when the Galilleo probe was inserted into the Jovian
atmosphere, and a number of scientists on CSPAN were talking about
Jupiter, they commented that the interior of Jupiter would be twice (or
whatever number) the gravity of Earth.

       You're dealing with a much greater *mass* than with Earth, and
thus greater gravity.  I don't see where in here is the flaw.

       Because there wasn't a jumpgate he had access to, only a jump
point created by the White Star.  In the prior situation, he blew up a
standing jump gate.  The only one in the vicinity would be at the
transfer point near Io, which if destroyed would seriously harm Earth

       I believe Sheridan wasn't shown the badge in the comic; and
Garibaldi is always cautious about what he says in front of others,
like Kirkish.

       Thanks.  Actually, we crank up the whole Nightwatch story over
the next two episodes, and what's happening with Earth, until it hits
fever pitch. Things really start to move.  (There's almost a short lull
after #10, just to let folks catch their breath a bit before the next

       Actually, no, the plan next season is not to write all of them;
it only happened this season because so much gets changed that it's
hard to bring in freelancers.  Next season, things will have stabalized
enough to bring in freelancers again.

       "If Talia is 'the future' then why is she off the show?"

       Because stuff happens.  Because rocketry was the hope of the
German Luftwaffe to win the war.  Didn't work out that way.  Just
because a character says it, doesn't mean that it's guaranteed to
happen at all times. A parent can look at a child and say, "He's our
hope for the future," and the next day the kid gets turfed by a
semi-truck.  Stuff happens.  Nothing is guaranteed in the B5 universe;
any character -- ANY character -- is vulnerable.  That, for me, is part
of what's exciting.

       Vir is in this season about as much as last, yes.

       Talia's gift was exactly what was indicated, nothing much

telekinesis.

       No plans for Ironheart for long, long time.

       Exactly.  You need a clear and present danger, and with a
population that nearly got wiped out by the Minbari, who are skittish
to begin with, you drag out the possibility of someone else doing the
same thing and it makes it a lot easier to do what you want to do.

       Having taken steps to further help promote the show, there's a
lot more happening.  If you're in Portland tonight watch "Good Evening"
tonight at 7:30 p.m. on KGW and in Seattle on "Evening" on KING-TV for
a piece on "Point of No Return."  Also, tomorrow's Showbiz Minute on
CNN will do stuff on this episode as well.

       EXTRA will be running clips this weekend, and the AP has a
story on it, as well as the New York Times Syndicate Inside-Trek
column.  The episode has been picked as a highlight in the Philadelphia
press, the LA Times, and in major newspapers in Dallas, Houston,
Chicago, San Francisco, New York and elsewhere.

       Slowly, we're getting noticed.

       Well, they all could've died.

       Neither situation relied on introducing new technology, only on
taking advantage of what's known currently.  It's a simple equation:
ship A is more powerful than ship B.  In a head-to-head situation, ship
A (shadow) will destroy ship B (white star).  If you can't directly
confront a stronger enemy, you have to find some way to work around it,
outsmart it.  (And fortunately, this one was flawed, "insane," as
Delenn put it.)

       And the minbari know more than they're saying.  But then that's
generally true of them.

       And yes, the shadow ship arrived with a new "core" for the
buried ship.

       If presidents, ministers and generals can't control the media,
we have little chance of doing so.  So we just have to try to keep
things close to the vest on our own (which is why the title for 322 is
classified for now).

       Whether I write the episode, or a freelancer does, the fee per

       Given that we're looking at a high-energy weapon capable of
burning through a four-mile wide Narn orbital base as though it were
made of butter, it's putting out enough energy, I figured, to lead to a
reaction with the hydrogen, whether it's a fusion reaction of some
other.

       We're talking a concentrated level of energy equal to a
thermonuclear reaction on a controlled level, or a fusion weapons
system with an energy output well beyond contemporary science to
calculate (particularly since this system is capable of delivering the
energy, undiluted, to targets tens or dozens of miles distant).

                                                                  jms

       Not a gaffe; we flopped the shot because the writing was done
left to right, instead of right to left, which is Narnish script.

                                                                  jms

       It's Nightwatch.

       The thread will diminish for a while, then return down the road
in later seasons, after the story takes its third major turn.

       By the last few episodes, pretty much all of my cards are on
the table. But by the last episode of this season, we find that the
game we've assumed we've been playing ain't necessarily the game at
all.  The show takes a fairly subversive direction, and of all the
seasons so far, the one that follows, year four, represents the
greatest writing challenge to make this actually work.

       Which is another reason why it's important to get the B4
storyline and several other threads out in the open, and clear the
decks, because this is gonna take every bit of whatever talent I've got
to pull off.

       Year four is the point in the novel when you're just past the
halfway mark; you know the reader thinks he or she has got the story
sussed out. The reader knows all your tricks by now, or thinks he/she
does.  You've been pulling doves out of your hat for 243 pages.

       Now you'd damned well better be able to pull out an alligator.

                                                                  jms

       During Larry's last year with us, I did most of the rewriting
on freelance scripts anyway, so it doesn't really save me much on
typing.  (If anything, the process is longer and more difficult than
just writing 'em myself.)  Doing it this year was an interesting

anytime soon.

> Has anybody brought up Vincent Van Gogh yet?

       It was a mild Spring day, warm, clear, sunny, when Vincent Van
Gogh picked up his easel, and some paints, and walked a mile and a half
to an open field where he often painted landscapes.  He set up his
easel, sat under a tree for a while, ate part of an apple, composed a
brief note to his brother Theo.  Then he pulled out a derringer and
shot himself in the chest.

       After an hour, realizing that he was not going to die for a
while yet, he picked himself up and staggered the mile and half back to
Theo's house, where a few hours later that evening he passed away in
Theo's arms.

       Some say his sad ending came about because he felt he was a
burden to his brother Theo, and the guilt did him in; others because he
sold only one painting during his life, for 48 francs, and he felt he
would never become a painter of any worth.

       On reflection, perhaps it was the thought of people bidding for
his ear that did it.

       Exactly.  The goal would seem to be impossible.  So how do we
do it? Is there a vulnerability that's been laid out but not picked up
yet?  Is there an advantage we don't necessarily see yet?

       We have to be smarter.  Humans are at our best when against the
wall. And we have to do it ourselves, in the final analysis, nobody
else can do it for us.

       Yes, sometimes they introduce talk shows as an instrument of

       Yes, the current mini-arc (8-10) is the second major turn in
the storyline.  The third starts with the last episode of this season,
going into the fourth year.  Then you've got one more big turn about
the last quarter or one-third of year four, and then a bit of a flip at
the end.

       We found that the research division wasn't being updated on air
schedules; the new reports now feature accurate ratings for accurate
times, which gives us a *much* better understanding of what's going on.

 Joel Hilke <102354.1702@compuserve.com> asks:
> But would he have fired on another earth ship?

       If I can, let me address one aspect of this, for your
consideration.

       Back when I was working on MURDER, SHE WROTE, we'd sometimes
get letters saying, "This wasn't a good episode because I figured out
the ending. It wasn't a surprise."  (Which is, to some extent, your
point here.)

       The problem we had with that particular letter was this: of
COURSE you figured it out.  Because you were paying attention to all
the clues we had put out there in the episode.

       There seems to be this notion that nobody should be able to
jump ahead, or else something's wrong or bad about the episode. 
Absolutely not true.  If you're going to play fair with the audience,
whether it's B5 or M,SW, you've got to put enough bits of information
out on the table so that the person who's really following it can
figure it out...so that at the end, those who *didn't* figure it out
can back up the tape, watch for the clues or leads, and see where it
all came from.  That's playing fair.

       If NObody gets it, you haven't done your job right.

       If EVERYbody gets it, you haven't done your job right.

       The best case scenario is a bell-shaped curve.  Some don't have
a clue what's coming, some manage to figure it out, and the majority
have a kind of vague sense where it's going, but there are still
surprises along the way.  If the bell-curve shifts one direction or the
other, then you're in trouble.

       So far, B5 seems to be hewing right to the bell-curve.  For
every person who says "okay, this was expected," there's been another
saying, "I had no *idea* this was going to happen here, or so fast." 
(Many of these have been right on this forum, in fact.)

       Finally, do bear in mind that you have an advantage here that
99% of all the viewers don't: the discussion here on CIS, and direct
comments from me.  For instance, I just noted elsewhere that we've got
major turns at the end of this season, and one 2/3rds into year 4. 
Now, if at those points, somebody says, "Well, I knew this was coming,
that's bad," I intend to whap them, because the reason they likely knew
it was coming was because I *said so* right here.

       But that same 99% doesn't have this advantage.

       This is the main difference I've noted in the mail that's come
in: the net-folks are constantly trying to figure out what's coming up
next, treating it like a mystery story (which, really, it's not, any
more than ANY novel is a mystery in that you don't necessarily know its
turns and twists as you're reading it), whereas the non-netted folks
tend to just take it as it comes.

       See, that's the other part of this.  People on the nets tend to
treat it as though it's a mystery novel, and when it doesn't hit that
aspect, say it's flawed as a result...when it was never INTENDED to
function as a mystery novel.  It's a novel period.  A mystery novel
depends absolutely on the riddle at the center of it.  This is a saga,
which uses a different structure.  It isn't a mystery any more than
Lord of the Rings is a mystery, even though when I first read it I was
wondering what was going to happen next.

       Also, a mystery novel is done when the mystery is finally
unraveled. Not so the B5 story.  By the end of this season, most of the
mysteries will be unraveled, and the pieces laid on the table for all
to see.  It then becomes a matter of what the characters *do* about it
thereafter.

       If I'm doing my job right, and setting up things to come
properly, and giving all the clues to it, then by definition a certain
number of people HAVE to figure out what's coming.  As long as it's the
smaller portion, that's as it *should* be.  So you'll understand why I
tend to get in here for a moment when that's held up as something bad
or poorly done. (And, again, even you note that the only reason you
knew about the shadows on Mars was via reading it here, or others read
it via the comics.  Again, that's a very small portion of the audience;
most I've heard from had NO idea about that aspect of it.  If you
hadn't read it here, you likely would have been surprised by it.)

       Anyway, just something to consider in all of this....

                                                                  jms

       What I usually get are letters that say, "I didn't know there
was an arc until I saw four or five episodes."  Because that's an
aspect that really hasn't been as well promoted as it could've been. 
But once they glommed onto it, they ran with it.

       The theory is that we'll use the fan club web page to allow

       If you could send me a copy of the catalog, I'd appreciate it. 
We have already shut down some of these companies, but others sprout up
again, offering inferior merchandise or models that fall apart fast. 
When we do models, and eventually we will, they will be *quality* and
worth fans spending hard-earned money to purchase, not cheapo
knockoffs.  (As a for instance, when we sell patches and pins via the
fan club, they will be made by the same sub-contractor who makes them
for the show, so they'll be high quality and *100% authentic*.)

       Also, bear in mind that Sheridan went into Earth-space knowing
the risks.  For him to fire on the Aggy would be selfish, and wrong; he
knew full well that this could be a one-way ride.

       If you're going to have a situation where Sheridan fires on EA
ships, it has to be the ONLY way of dealing with the situation, and it
has to be SUPREMELY motivated, so that it's not just him or one of our
guys who's at stake.  It has to be a big situation to merit taking the
lives of fellow officers, in the same service.

                                                                  jms

       Most of the Omega class of destroyers are given Greek names,
such as Achilles, Alexander, Agamemnon and others.

       And thanks.

       Thanks.  I think Zack was mainly nervous in that last bit,
which may account for his twitchiness.  And yes, Morella often
prophesied for Turhan.

       I think they know the White Star (aka the unidentified ship)
got away, but they put the best face on it back home.  Which is one
more reason why Clark's declared martial law.  Things are spinning out
of control, he's in increasingly hot water back home, and he has to
seize control.  Whoever was in that alien ship knows too much about his
operations...if that were to come out, he's finished.

       Good point.  Because the show *is* going somewhere, it's
possible for people, knowing that, to jump ahead a bit.  90% of the
speculations are wrong, but if 10% are right, then there you are.

       Of course it can't hold.  And they're going to go through
plenty of fire.  Remember, this is the first of three that accomplish
that.  Each escalates upon what went before.  Don't worry...you'll get

       I think probably the hardest thing in the writing this season
has been in pulling the story through the next level, around the
corner, and into a new relative shape.  Some things are the same, and a
lot of things are different the deeper you go into this season.  It's
been a real tough act to get this boat where it needs to go, but I
think we pulled it off.

       Ivanova's not what you'd call orthodox under any circumstances.

Subject: Finished Writing!

       Well, it's done.  I have today turned in the first draft of
script #22 for year three, which I suppose could be called a
cliffhanger episode. This marks the first time in the 50+ year history
of American television that one person has singlehandedly written an
entire season of a series. (The closest record is Terry Nation, who
wrote the 13-episode first season of Blake's 7.)

       (I have no plans to do this next season, btw; this was
necessary because of the substantive changes in the B5 universe this
season.  Next season is a very different story...literally as well as
figuratively.)

       So far the film based on those 1,000+ pages represents some of
our best work on Babylon 5.  There's some nifty stuff coming.

       We are currently filming episode #18.  Four more after this,
and we'll be finished shooting year three, as of April 9th.  Not long
after, we should get the word on year four, probably by late
April/early May.  But the writing is finished...and for the first time
in 8 months, I will be able to go out, see a movie, play Wing
Commander, find something that vaguely resembles a life.  This is where
I now also become a director's worst nightmare: a writer-producer who's
finished writing and finally has time to hang out on the set and give
lots and lots of helpful advice.

       It was a hideous task; two-thirds through I began to understand
that there was a *reason* nobody's ever done this before...you'd have
to be outta your ever-loving mind to even try.  But as with everything
else on B5, if we don't know it's impossible, we just go ahead and do
it.

       The title, as stated elsewhere, is classified, though you may
get a sense of what's coming in the two eps that precede it. 
Regardless, the writing on year three is now complete.  Overall, I'm
quite pleased, and I think by the time you hit this episode, you'll
feel the same.

                                                                  jms

       The editorial does seem odd when you then flip to the back of
the magazine and realize that the highest marks were *consistently*
given to jms scripts.  That would appear to be a contradiction.  I
think it's also a bit unwise to question the quality of a season before
you've even *seen* it.  I suspect someone will be reconsidering those
words by the end of the season.

       Also, it wasn't like I sat down and decided to do this for my
own benefit...this season, with so much happening, the show changing so
dramatically, it's nearly impossible to bring freelancers into that. 
Next season, when the chairs have stopped moving around, that can
change and we can have other writers again.  This was necessity, not
whim.

       Elsewise...thanks for the kind comments on PoNR.

                                                                  jms

       It's not always as simple as that.  You also take a uniquely
Western perspective.  Look around at Russia, Cuba, 1930s Germany and
the beer hall putsch, Iraq, Iran...a leader can survive all kinds of
opposition if he has sufficient control of the armed forces.  After the
Gulf War, it was generally assumed that Saddam would be gone within a
few months; now his position is stronger than ever.

       Also, Clark didn't (ostensibly) declare martial law to protect
himself, he did it because of an imminent alien threat which was
detected long before these allegations came out, we just had Ganymede
attacked and that's spitting distance from the primary Earth jump gate
at Io...there is indication of collaboration and conspiracy among some
in the Joint Chiefs (and in fact that's correct, from his point of
view, given Hague's activities)...there's enough ammo there to justify
martial law.  Dissolve the Senate?  Just happened a couple years ago in
Russia, when we had tanks firing on the Senate building. Some might say
that Yeltsin was in the same position as Clark in that his motives
might be saving himself.

       (The majorit of our posters, btw, are taken from genuine WW II
propaganda and war-support posters that were actually in use.  We make
some slight modifications, but the gist is there.  Yes, we do fall for
these things, we do go for these things.  We always have.)

       As for the USA-western perspective...during WW II we saw
Japanese civilians interned in camps along the West Coast...afterward
we saw people prosecuted for being Reds, saw careers and lives
destroyed by even the hint of "commie" influence.  If you look at
newsreels and documentary footage from the time, you see a populace,
fresh out of a war, who survived by focusing on the Enemy, given a new
enemy.  Might they have gone along with some kind fo martial law if
they thought that if they *didn't* cooperate, the nation might be
vulnerable to Russian nukes or invasion?  I think the climate was
perfect for it.

       Could it happen right here, right now?  No, because the
surrounding climate isn't right.  Could it happen if the conditions
*were* right?  Of course it could.  We're not genetically or
evolutionarily different from the Germans or the Russians or the Cubans
or the Iraquis.  If we think we'd never fall for that, we place
ourselves in *exactly* the position of guaranteeing that we *will* fall
for it.  Because we won't recognize it when it happens. We can justify
and rationalize it as something else.

       Yeah, people back on Earth still have guns.  What of it?  Right
now, with martial law, the streets are quiet, the news is more positive
than usual for a change, the quarrelsome jerks in the senate have been
given a good kick in the butt, the president's getting things *done*,
we've all still got our jobs, the muggers are hiding out, life goes on
except for the lawbreakers. You gonna go out on your own and start
shooting at Earthforce troops armed to the teeth with *vastly* more
advanced weaponry?  On whose behalf?  The aliens? The troublemakers? 
What're we rallying for?  Or against?  This'll blow over soon, it
always does.  It never lasts.  Right now, just ride it out, wait and 
see what happens.  Who knows...maybe Clark's right?  Who wants to be
perceived as a traitor?

       Those are the thoughts of any populace in this situation.  Just
as when Yeltsin declared martial law in Moscow, as when Mayor Daly sent
in the shock troops in Chicago, on and on.

       Here's the number one rule: a population will always stay
passive for as long as they perceive that they stand to lose more by
opposing the government than by staying quiet.  It's when they have
little or nothing left to lose that they rise up; the politicos first,
then, more reluctantly, the general population.

                                                                  jms

       'Course, if you were to do anything that monumental, you'd
spike right smack in the middle of your three-part story.

       One of the things about these three episodes that's again worth
stressing is that they're really one story, linked carefully.  Each of
the three begins *one frame* after the other.  After they've aired, if
you sit down with a VCR and edit them together, you'll find that they
flow absolutely SEAMLESSLY from one to the other.  So PoNR is at the
dead center of the piece that propels you toward the last third, like
the second act in a three-act play (which was my structure for this).

       That may help.

       I imagine that Writer's Digest'll be plugging the book in June,

     And then we'd be just like SAAB.  I'd rather we set our own tone.
I like the jumping from humor to dark stuff...for one thing, it keeps
the audience from collectively sticking their heads in ovens across the
country. Second, a good dramatic piece can help create tension which
laughter relieves, giving you a roller-coaster effect.

       We knew that at some juncture they'd be split, so numbering
them as parts 1, 2 and 3 would be awkward.  And distribution hates
having to market multi-parters, for reasons of their own.  So...three
episodes.
