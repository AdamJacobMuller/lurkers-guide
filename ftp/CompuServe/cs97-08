"I would like to express my appreciation for the way that you and all
the members of the cast at Blackpool gave no hint of the turmoil going
on over that weekend."

      Thanks.  You are kinder than honesty would warrant.  We were all
more than a bit upset as we watched things unravel in front of our
eyes; Bruce was about as upset as I've ever seen him, although he
buttoned it up beautifully when the fans came around, because they
deserved only the best.  I did my best there, but there were lapses...I
was sharper tempered than I should have been with a couple of stewards,
because I was more at the direct center of the whole situation, and
immensely frustrated and bugged at the whole thing. I guess that's why
I'm a writer and not an actor.  But it's been nagging at me ever since
I left, frankly, because they had no way of knowing what was going on,
or why I was in that state, and they certainly didn't do anything to
merit that.

                                                                  jms

      Our casting director, Fern Champion (and I can't tell you the
amount of humor we have with that name), like all casting directors,
makes the rounds of theaters and movies and TV shows to see who's hot. 
So she has her own list. On top of that, once a role comes out in a
script, it goes out to actor's agents in what's called a "breakdown," a
two- or three-paragraph description of the character: age, sex,
attitude, the part itself, guest or recur or regular...all that.  The
various agents then send the info on to their clients who seem to fit
the bill.  Then if the actor is interested, the agents sends "sides,"
meaning pages from the script in which the character appears.

      If the actor likes the sides, and the character, the agent then
contacts the casting director and tries to get their client into the
audition.  There's some prescreening...if we see the resume ahead of
time, and actor X doesn't have the training or experience, we move
on...but in the end, we get anywhere from 5-9 people in for an
audition.  If we like one of those, we cast that person.  If we're
caught on two, we do a callback with those two and decide. (We = the
CD, me, John, Doug and the director.)

                                                                  jms

      I could write all of S5, but at this point there is no *need* to
do so, so why do it?  Just for the record?  No...I'm just as happy to
bring in a few outside scripts.  Not many, only about 5, just to break
it up a little.

      Actually, our casting director at the time (not the same as
Fern) apparently didn't feel Wayne had enough credits for our show, and
it took John Copeland (who'd seen his work) finally pulling rank to get
him in the door to where I could see him.  Once in...that was that.

      The problem over there isn't the material, it's the restraints
put *on* the material by Paramount.  Jeri Taylor is one of the best
writers and best show runners in town; give her room to flex her
muscles, and she can flatten any show around and blow the doors off SF
TV.  Unfortunately, due to the Paramount heavy-handedness and
restrictions on all their writers, you have a situation with a Ferrari
sitting in a garage and never allowed to go more than 20 miles around
the block.

      I'm keeping DC and David in my hip pocket for the moment; there
are an awful lot of writers who've wanted desperately to write for the
show in the last few years, who couldn't because I did two seasons
alone.  I have kind of a moral obligation to give those folks a shot,
and since there are only about 5 open assignments, I have to be very
selective.  If I can in good conscience give one to David or DC, I will
definitely consider doing so.  But the new guys deserve a shot.

      No, the final four contractually belong to the local stations;
they may not be showing it *now*, but should be showing it in October.

      Hatrack would, of course, be a loose interpretation of the bony
crest at the top of a Minbari's head.

      (long pause to see if he buys it or not)

      Okay, okay...bear in mind that if you misuse the language you
can create words that don't actually exist.  In German, for instance,
they create new words by adding suffixes and prefixes to previous words
(as Mark Twain said, they eventually acquire a perspective, like a
train receding into the distance).  The fact that Ivanova came up with
that word -- taking English in her head and trying to find Minbari
equivilants -- doesn't mean that it *is* a word to the Minbari.  I can
say, "uberfleidermaus," which would mean "the supervising bat," but
that ain't a word the Germans would recognize, even though it is in
German.

      B5 was created in 1987; the pilot was shot actually before the

air.  There were only a few weeks between the airing of the two pilots.

      Yeah, a number of shows are now adapting the B5 storytelling
model, with an overarching arc and shows that keep it going.  The new
Roddenberry series has a five year arc of its own, apparently.  More
will follow, now that we've broken the ice.

      I honestly don't know how important the web has been because
frankly, if you added up all the web-users out there, it wouldn't be a
blip on the ratings charts.  That said, our audience has definitely
increased over the last 4 years, one of the few syndicated shows that
has grown while nearly all the rest have fallen.  Xena has grown, and I
think one or two others, but that's it.

      It just takes any show a while to find its audience, or in this
case, for our audience to find *us*, given scheduling.  We've begun
doing that, and are nearly at critical mass.

       No, it was just a natural extension of already being online. 
The only deliberate decision involved was, "Do I *change* my life and
what I do for pleasure just because I'm more well known now than
before?"  I'm still the same person, so the answer was no.

      One of the first things I had to do, in plotting out the
storyline, was to set aside trap doors for *every single character*,
because you never know when or how the real world is going to impinge
upon you.  An actor can quit, or get hit by a car, or slammed by a
meteor...there's no way to control the characters the way you do in a
novel.  That's a given.  But you can't bring X-million viewers along to
a certain point, then say, "Well, all the stuff we were going to do we
can't because X isn't here."

      So in a way, the structure of the story is kind of like a
computer game tree...pull out a piece along the way, and it goes down a
different path, but ends up at exactly the same point at the end.  It's
the difference between different *results* and different ways of
*getting* there.

      You can do a story about a platoon in WW II, for instance, and
some of the platoon may live, die, be injured, whatever...but the story
of WWII is the story of WWII.

      Beyond that, a challenge is just that: a call to see just how
good you *really* are, kid.  If you've ever seen GLORY, there's the
scene in which one of the Massachusetts 54th is being taught to shoot. 
He does just fine, hits the target, reloads fine...when nobody's
shooting at him.  At which point the colonel starts firing a revolver
right next to his head, teling him to try and do it NOW, and do it
FAST, with ten thousand guns firing at him.

      That's when the art comes in, that's when the skill comes
in...in dealing with what you *don't* expect.

                                                                  jms

       No, these scripts are *not* legitimate or legal.  I know they
say they buy from "script dealers," but that translates out to "people
who stole scripts from studios."  WB is aware of this one, and
preparing to go after them.  The actual ownership of the physical
*script* itself is shared and/or alternated by the studio and the
writer, and it *cannot* be sold without the permission of the writer.

       Selling B5 scripts is something I'd like to do, with the
difference that the writers involved -- David, Larry, Peter, everybody
 -- would get a percentage, just as with a book publication.  That's the
way it *should* be done.  These guys who sell scripts through stores
and mail order don't give a penny to the creators or writers whose work
they are selling.

"From what I've seen of Bruce B. on shows like PI and the like, he
must be one of the most unpretentious TV stars I've seen.  I wonder how
much this has to do with him working with James Arness."

      I don't know if it's specifically that, but yeah, Bruce does
have a kind of outspokenness and frankness and "ah, hell," attitude
that comes from his long association with westerns.  He's absolutely a
straight shooter.

"I can't imagine what B5 would have been like without Bruce.  Bruce
has brought a LOT to the show.  You, and the fans, really lucked out by
Bruce getting on board."

      Bruce has done a great job.  He loves the role, he *is* the
Captain, and around the stage he's the show's cheerleader, team
captain, and resident bright spirit.  Peter also does a lot of that, as
does Rick, but Bruce is just an amazing team player.

"Am I out of touch, but doesn't the Basic Agreement with the Guild

      Yes and no.  For instance...my script for "The Coming of
Shadows" is being published in the UK by Boxtree, and subsequently in
the US.  There is no ancillary payment for this other than the general
licensing fee that goes against the overall merchandising revenue
stream.  (Showbiz talk, folks, pay no attention.)  So I don't get any
kind of royalty on the script book per se at all.  I called the WGA,
and this is entirely within their purview.  Also, Fox is selling

      No, you almost always write the character long before you have
the actor; you just find the actor that fits the character, then slowly
the two begin to merge once the role is cast.  When Bruce came on

the line (meaning not counting actors, directors, and writers).  There
actually wasn't a syndicated TV contract in existence...which is why
most shows shoot out of LA, because they were afraid to work something
out with the union. So we then negotiated the first syndicated TV
contract that I'm aware of for shooting here in LA, and which is now
being used to bring other shows back to LA that had left previously.

      You're quite correct, she's definitely too young to be

No, the mining incident took place when he was first officer on the

      The improvements were instituted when David Moessinger was
brought on as Executive Producer.  He did a year of the show and then
left when Angela was named exec.  The improvements were already in
place by then.

      Re: Angela...I have to say I enjoyed working with her.  She
struck me as a woman of tremendous integrity and honesty, not to
mention skill.  As an example...when she took over as exec, there was
one episode being directed by her son, who had been doing them here and
there for about a year.  As I watched the dailies, I found he had
gotten the episode *completely* wrong and was, in my view, undercutting
the whole episode.

      I went out, very upset and angry, and confronted him in front of
the whole crew.  Suffice to say it's bad form (I was angry, it was
stupid, I make no excuses) to do after a director in front of his crew
in *any* event, even if you are a writer/producer but to go after the
*son* of the *star and executive producer*?

      I got back to the offices and everybody was just
dead-white...they said, "You're going to be fired the second she hears
about this."  About an hour or two later, the phone rang, and she
wanted to see me.  I went to her office, and she asked, "What happened,
and why did you do what you did?"

      I explained the situation, why I was upset, and explained how
the episode was being killed in the directing because he didn't
understand a large part of it.  She considered it for a moment...and
finally nodded.  "You did the right thing," she said, and that was the
end of it.

      That took a lot of guts and integrity on her part.  She knew me
well enough to know that I leave my ego at the door, and all that
concerns me is doing what's best for the show, and the story. 
Sometimes, on some shows, that ain't enough.  With her, it was.  'nuff
said.

                                                                  jms

       Actually, the B5 cover has become an instant collector's item,

those who bought multiple copies now have a good little investment on

       Because posting material already existant about a show is one
thing (and WB requires that the proper copyright be appended to all
such web sites in any event).  A different situation is a sim, which
*uses* copyrighted characters and situations, creating a *game* which
is not licensed, which also results in *story material* that also
infringes on the copyright and could create further complications.

                                                                  jms

       No, the re-editing has not been completed; the editors jumped
in and did some of it, based on my notes, in their spare time, because
they want to see it done, but the actual

yet to be done, and that's where the main part of the work happens.

{original post unavailable}

"Originally, the creators of B5 went to the ST folks with the concept.
They thought it would be easier to launch the B5 concept in the ST
Universe. However, after much talk, the Trek folks turned it down. 
Soon after, DS9 was launched."

      This has been repeated elsewhere and needs to be corrected.

      1) B5 was *never* at any time submitted to anyone at Star Trek.

      2) B5 was *never* considered by me, or anyone involved with B5,
or discussed with anyone, as taking place in the ST universe.  This
story could flatly and simply not take place within the confines of the
ST universe as set up and maintained.

      3) B5 was *never* turned down by the ST folks for reasons 1 and
2 above.

      4) B5 *was* submitted (treatment, artwork, series bible, pilot
screenplay) to Paramount Television, which did review the material for
some time before deciding to try other avenues.

      Just to clarify....

                                                                  jms

      The only thing that is intense about this news is that it's

stuff for 501, and has a major personal arc throughout the first part
of this season, another toward the end of the season, and is on board
for all 22 episodes.

      He didn't make it into the movies because of agent stuff, but
that's only the two movies, and we have every intention of having him
in the third one.

      This is one of the problems with the internet...someone mishears
something, posts it, and because it came from "an authoritative
source" in this case Peter, it gets picked up as real.  And then I have
to spend days correcting and "contradicting the cast, so who's telling

how dare I "get rid of" both Ivanova and Garibaldi in the same season,
accusing me of trying to sneak the "firing of Garibaldi" under the
radar while everyone was off looking at the Claudia situation...so I
spent a great deal of time calming people down, then backtracking it to
the original source (which would've been faster if I'd just done a
tapcis sweep here, but the notes all came to me from the internet,
from those with shared CIS accounts, or who knew someone who had a CIS
account). The root for all of them was your note, or someone who'd seen
your note and went ballistic.

       People need to understand that when they post unverified
information as "news," and it's wrong...and it's wrong about 9 times
out of ten... ultimately, I'm the one who pays the price for it.

       Her first day is today.  She's working out swimmingly. 
Everyone is finding her a real joy to work with.  She took home about
30 tapes of prior shows to watch over the weekend, has buried herself
in homework studying scripts and articles about the show, and has
basically impressed the hell out of the cast and crew.

       And no, I can't tell you yet.

       Actually, this is not "a stupid rumor," in that Paramount did
have the material dating back well before DS9 was conceived.  It's a
rumor if it comes from somebody outside.  It's my show, I was there.

       No, no plans to put B5 into book form; it was designed to be
told for TV, and that's where it should stay...and the sequel is still
being negotiated.
