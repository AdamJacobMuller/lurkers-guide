      Stephen filmed that sequence by having all of the cast on the

"By any chance, is the post-apocalyptic religious order shown in
"Deconstruction . ." a direct decendant of Brother Theo's order on
Babylon 5?"

      It's altogether possible....

      And Theo is only awaiting a story worth bringing him in for.

      Exactly (and thanks).  A few people have interpreted the final
card as "meanspirited" (when it's on one level a reaction *to* five
years of constant carping and meanspiritedness from lots of sectors,
from the nets to the press and elsewhere)...but what it is, is a
statement of hope.  That whenever you try something different, there
are going to be naysayers, and people who say it can't be done, and
certainly can't be done by *you*.

      It ain't just B5, it's any dream out there.

      And in the end, they are wrong.

      Faith manages.

      That's the message of the card.

      That, and the truth that in 10 years the naysayers will be
forgotten, and made irrelevant...but the show, the *show*...goes on. 
And will be around long after they and I have gone to dust.  And all
people will know when they see that card, 50 years from now, was that
some jerks said it couldn't be done, and they were wrong, because they
are *always* wrong.  If you have the dream, the ability and the
passion, you can bring your dreams to life despite overwhelming
opposition.  That's the message.

      But for those on the other side, they will never see anything
other than meanspiritedness because that's all they can *ever*
see...because that's all they can bring to the table.

      There's an old saying about books, which I'll rephrase to
include B5: Babylon 5 is like a book, and a book is like a mirror: if
an ass peers in, you can't exactly expect an apostle to peer out.

                                                                  jms

"Happily your note could only be read as mean-spirited by someone
feeling a bit guilty. It is a mirror: you get out of the comment what
you put into it's creation. You see it as a redemption/accomplishment
of a plan, I see it as a confirmation of my own fandom, and a critic
will see it as an insult on his/her own unkind words."

      Something for everyone....

"But have you had many negative comments about it? I hope not as many
as you've had positive."

      No, not that much...and what there is, is mainly from the
weasels for whom it was somewhat intended.

"BTW: was my interpretation of the fiery emergence of the Agamemnon an
over-interpretation on my part? Or will you remain enigmatic - it
means whatever it means!"

      It seemed an appropriate placeholder when WB told us we had to
omit Claudia's credit because she also appears in (the new) 522,
"Sleeping in Light," to avoid incurring fees.

"It's been said B5 represents a paradigm shift in science fiction -
and we're all better for it."

      Sometimes I think maybe we've actually done it....

1.  Is Sheridan the "One Who Will Be" because he stops the
Vorlon/Shadow war and ends the reign of the First Ones? Is it because
he is the founder of the new Interstellar Alliance?  Or is there yet
another (currently unrevealed) reason?

      That's part of it, and what he grows into.

2. Did Zathras see the founding of the new Alliance, or just the end
of the Vorlon/Shadow war?

      I think he had a sense of it.

3.  Does "The One" take on a different meaning beyond the
Sinclair/Valen-Delenn-Sheridan trilogy in the *future*?

      Depends on how you look at it.

                                                                  jms

      The future wasn't being transmitted back; we were seeing the
records of the past from the point of view of the final character, one
million years hence, who has come to collect them prior to the final
chapter in Earth's history.

      Well, there's Crusade (the follow-up series), the B5 prequel,

and several other series notions I have in various stages of

      Mainly it's been in terms of the violence and language...I don't
think we ever could've done G'Kar's whipping scene on network TV, for

      The mac and pc versions of the B5 informational CDrom should be

      B5 was always designed to be, and announced as, a 5 year story.

"If WB is involved in making production decisions, why don't they
carry the show in their primary market?"

      I don't know what you mean here by "primary market," since
"market" is usually taken to mean a particular area or region, so the
term is being used here incorrectly.  If you mean syndication, the
influx of new shows and the other mini-networks has chewed up available
time-slots...and remember, TNT is now owned by WB, so one could argue
about what is now their "primary" venue.

      I don't think it's anticlimatic at all; putting on our logic
hats for the moment, do you really think that I intend to wipe out all
of humanity and decimate the earth in Crusade?  No.  In any show, this
is going to be a given, the question is how do you *get* there?  The
premise exists to push us out on a mission...it's what happens in
pursuit of that mission that's going to be especially interesting.

      As with Londo/G'Kar, you saw them strangling each other...but it
was in the learning of *how* and *why* this happened that the fun
started.

      Some general stuff....

      Today, John Copeland and I finished re-editing "The Gathering,"
the B5 pilot movie.  While there were some areas we couldn't get into
because of the complexity in redoing the mix, virtually every scene got
tinkered with to one degree or another, and most important, the roughly
14 minutes of footage left out of the original version is now back in. 
The whole thing is tighter and faster, and there's more recent CGI,
we'll have Chris Franke re-score it, and it's just in general a lot
better.  (Some parts of it even make more sense now.)

      One additional change: because of the desire on PTEN's part to
have as many commercial breaks as possible, the 6-act script was
jerry-rigged and broken down into 9 acts.  One side-effect of this is
that 9 acts wears on you, and wears you out, more than the standard 6. 
You start to get a feeling of being led up to things too often, and
there isn't time to dwell on the acts you're in.  I was finally able,
with this re-edit, to move scenes back around again to what I
originally wanted in a 6-act structure (you'll see a number of scenes
juxtaposed from their original order).

      Anyway...the TNT Special Edition is much improved over the
original.

      Other stuff: the fanclub site continues to expand and improve. 
If you haven't been around in a while, you may want to check it out
again sometime soon (http://www.thestation.com).  The chat room is
running better than ever before, there are new graphics, and the B5
Emporium should be online in a matter of days allowing purchase of B5FC
stuff online with credit cards. (Mail order stuff is still being
processed.)

      Latest additions to the lineup: Psi Corps hats and pins, patches
of various sorts, Earth Alliance pins, Ship Recognition charts in
poster form, and others.

      Finally, I'll be a Guest of Honor at this year's LosCon, held
Thanksgiving weekend in L.A. at the Burbank Airport Hilton.  My 2-hour
B5 presentation will be Sunday afternoon, where I'll be showing clips
from the two TNT tv-movies (including lots of stuff from the finished
prequel), from upcoming S5 episodes, new bloopers and so on.  I'll also
be joined by John Copeland, producer, and Harlan Ellison, our
conceptual consultant.  This is always an SRO venue for us -- LosCon
has been a part of B5 from the start -- so you may want to get there
early.  (Or even go the day before; it's a fun convention.)

                                                                  jms

      Actually, I was watching a debate on PBS a few weeks ago, and
they made the point that Christianity may have been the *cause* of the
fall of the Roman Empire, rather than its saving grace...apparently it
began to take the church structure as its own model in how to operate
(when its own infrastructure began to collapse), and put religious
leaders into positions they should never have occupied for reasons of
simple incompetence, and in short order things began to fall apart.

      I wish I could've made that paragraph more sensible, but I was
writing while listening, and I only got the sense of it...perhaps
someone else out there who heard it can fill in the gaps, but that's

      Yes, that's the point...there will always be short-term
setbacks, but as long as we climb back a few inches higher than we were
before we fell down, we keep moving toward the goal of becoming a
better people, and getting off the planet.  Taking our place among the
stars.  While it's vaguely possible that I may *see* a Mars colony
sometime within my lifetime, I know that I will never live there...but
that ain't the point, it isn't a victory if *I* do it, and a failure if
*I* don't, it's if *we* do it or not.  Maybe we'll do it today, maybe
we'll do it tomorrow, the point is to decide to DO it, and then by god 
DO IT.

      And yeah, that little closing card is going to remain on the
show for its life...which will be long, long after its detractors (and
admittedly myself) have gone to dust.  On the one hand, it is a
statement of hope to anyone else out there who has a dream, to follow
it no matter who speaks against you, no matter the odds, no matter what
they say to or about you, no matter what roadblocks they throw in your
way.  What matters is that you remain true to your vision.

      On the other hand, for the reviewers and the pundits and the
critics and the net-stalkers who have done nothing but rag on this show
for five years straight, it is also a giant middle finger composed of
red neon fifty stories tall, that will burn forever in the night.

      In billiards, we call that a bank-shot.

      Why did the story of Ishmael end at the last page of Moby Dick?

      Because that's when the story ended.

      A story is a slice of a continued and continuous world; the
world exists before, and continues after.  The story never ends; you
just pull out pieces of it long enough to tell to other humans, who are
finite and cannot wait for infinity to unravel itself and tell us what
everything meant. Certainly, amazing things would continue to happen in
the B5 universe.  But our telling of this piece of the story, is
finite.

      We are finite.  Zathras is finite.

      The story is eternal.

> Have you read Elaine Pagels book, "The Gnostic Gospels?"

      That's an odd perspective since so much of Medeival christianity
ran on money...pilgrims providing a constant stream of money to various
churches and shrines to saints, leading to competitions between
shrines, and (of all things) the "sub-letting" of shrines by taking the
bones of saint A and sending on bone to shrine B, another to shrine C,
and generating money in those regions.  And of course the buying of
spiritual favors, patrons, the rich folk sending others to do penance
for them...it was all about money.

      (Source: Finucane's MIRACLES AND PILGRIMS, a fascinating book,
btw.)

      Interesting aside...for the last 6-8 months, I've been doing a
fair amount of research into medieval England, especially the medieval
church, for a play I'm writing (which may become a novel if I'm not
careful).  Dumped several hundred dollars on a massive order from
Amazon.com back a few months ago to fill out what I needed.  That was
what tangentially led me into the post-Burn sequence in
"Deconstruction."  My brain has been full of monks for the last 8
months or so, and knowing the role they played in maintaining secular
knowledge from about 500 AD and for some time thereafter, that seemed 
the perfect route to go that would also resonate with the look of the
Rangers and the religious caste Minbari and the whole feel we were
setting up.

      It was only when I was about halfway into the act that I
thought, "Oh, crud, this is the same area Canticle explored."  And for
several days I set it aside and strongly considered dropping it, or
changing the venue (at one point considered setting it in the ruins of
a university, but I couldn't make that work realistically...who'd be
supporting a university in the ruins of a major nuclear war?  Who'd
have the *resources* I needed?  The church, or what would at least LOOK
like the church.  My sense of backstory here is that the Anla-shok
moved in and started little "abbeys" all over the place, using the 
church as cover, but rarely actually a part of it, which was why they
had not gotten their recognition, and would never get it.  Rome
probably didn't even know about them, or knew them only distantly.)

      Anyway...at the end of the day, I decided to leave it as it was,
since I'd gotten there on an independent road, we'd already had a
number of monks on B5, and there's been a LOT of theocratic science
fiction written beyond Canticle...Gather Darkness, aspects of
Foundation, others.

      You're correct; the part where the money got to be bigtime for
the church was in the 13th-15th centuries.  That was where the saint
business went bigtime, to the point where the church bosses had to
start hammering the local branches where the saints were getting too
powerful, and began creating challenges to the main line of authority.

      I love the competition that broke out among them...some saying
that their saint was better at miracles than the one down the road, and
if you're stupid enough to *go* to the one down the road, why, things
could actually get worse for you....

the total and absolute fatigue.  Combined with only getting a few hours
sleep here and there, it's kinda taken a toll, but fortunately I'm at
the tail end of the thing finally, and should be back up to snuff in a
few days.

      No point in leaving the galaxy; stars go nova, it only affects
the immediate vicinity (big as that is).  By this point, they were in
the position of the Vorlons, and now have to take their (our) place
guiding the younger races, the next wave, while not getting in the way
and remembering the lesson of the shadow/vorlon conflict.

      The zinc lozenges are absolutely positively the #1 item to have
as soon as you start to feel a cold or flu coming on.  Trust me, I've
learned the hard way on this one (and they can alleviate the symptoms a
bit once you've got it).  You can get the cherry flavored ones, which
take some of the onus off it (the throat-candies with zinc aren't as
effective, btw).  Alternate zinc lozenges (NOT the pill form, letting
the lozenge dissolve slowly in the mouth) and the vitamin C (ditto) as
often as you can, eating to counteract any acidic effect...and lemme
tell you, it makes a HUGE difference.

      Things can sometimes be black and white without being right or
wrong. If I say a thing is hot and dry and you say it is wet and cold,
those are bipolar distinctions; neither is morally right nor wrong, but
there is a very definite and demonstrable difference.

done.

      No, no difference at all, from my perspective.  You find out who
the character is, what they want, how far they'll go to get it, and how
far someone else will go to stop them...and the rest attends to itself.

"I think one of the problems in N. Ireland is some people hold a
grudge for way too long."

      Granted.

      I was talking to one of the guys who worked on the shoot for
"The Quiet Man," filmed in Ireland.  At the end of the shoot, they were
going to have a huge wrap party, all the stars, crew, studio folk, the
whole bit.  A big deal, lots of money.  The guy was setting it up
through his aide over the phone from England, and after everything was
all set, just a few days before, he called himself just to make sure
everything was going ahead on schedule. The person in Ireland said it
was all fine, and could he have the name of the person to whom he was
speaking?

      "Cromwell," the guy said.

      They canceled the whole thing the instant he said that name.

They wanted to split up the B5 stuff for maximum result, so thaty had a
clip on the non-broadcast night, and Bruce for the broadcast night.

      I and John Copeland select all of the directors on the show.

      Parenthetical to this: there are only 3 people who are in charge
of this show: me, my partner Doug Netter (who mainly gets into the
business aspect and casting), and producer John Copeland.  That's it. 
Ain't nobody else.  We're very producer light on this show.

      End parenthetical.

      We go for directors whose work we know as a rule.  In some
cases, an agent will send us a reel (clips) of a director whose work we
don't know, and if the material looks good, we'll sit down with the
director (whichever way he/she came in) and see if their philosophy of
production is the same as ours. If so, we give 'em a shot.  If they
work out, they do more; if not, not. We've actually got a pretty good
track record on picking directors, and have rarely made a mistake we
couldn't recover from.

      We'll be off for Thanksgiving weekend, then we shoot until
December 19th, which takes us through 514.  We're on hiatus until
January 2nd, then we come back and shoot 515-522 (actually the 21st
episode of S5 since 422 is now 522 and 501 was made 422), wrapping
production on March 20th.  Then we take a few weeks off to let the cast
and crew catch their breath, and shoot the third TNT TV-movie in April.

Subject: The Last ep (wow)

{original post had no questions}

      Thanks; it's one of the things I try to do sometimes...I
basically give you my playbook, I tell you I'm coming right up the
middle, which makes the challenge on this side that much harder...you
already know where I'm going to be, now I have to do it in such a way
that it comes as a surprise regardless.

      This is actually more a literary device than a TV device; there
are any number of books (and some movies) which start at the end,
proceed to the middle, and end on the beginning.

      Because my background is in theater and prose, my natural
inclination is to play with the form as much as possible.  So each
season there's been at least one episode that's "off-format" for
us...Intersections was one, And Now for a Word was another, The
Illusion of Truth, Deconstruction...and in S5 so far almost half the
episodes have been off-format in one fashion or another. With this as
the last year, I figure I may as well go for broke and try some unusual
things.  If you can't do these things when you're starting out, because
it's too odd, you should at least do them when you're doing well and 
can afford the risk.

                                                                  jms

      The part of Lochley is very different from any of those roles;
it was almost certainly the character you were responding to.  Having
now seen her in a number of episodes, I think she's one of the best
additions we've had on the show, quite honestly.  And she's going to be
very popular...though in an offbeat sort of way, because of who *this*
character is.

      For hole-in-the-wall, try Salome Indian Restaurant at the corner
of Magnolia and Lankershim in Studio City...what I like about it is
that it doesn't back up and bite you an hour after eating it, which
(for me) a lot of Indian food does, though I'm very fond of it
nonetheless.  You don't go for the decor, but the food is great.  Try
the Chicken Tikka, the meat samosa for appetizer, or the Dal soup, the
Beef or Chicke Korma, Poori bread, maybe some nice vegetable biryani. 
I tend to eat there regularly.  (Another terrific Indian restaurant is
Taj Majal on Ventura Boulevard in Encino, around the 16000 block or so.
They do a mango-corn chowder that's terrific, and just about everything
else is good as well.)

      For Chinese, the Panda Inn in Glendale, at Wilson and Brand. 
They turned into a chain, but this is one of the original Panda Inns,
and the food is spectacular.  I recommend the Lemon Chicken, the Hot
Braised Sliced Fish, the Panda Beef (crispy, very nice), the Crab/Corn
soup, and if you like shrimp, the walnut shrimp is very nice.

      For coffee shops, Priscilla's in Toluca Lake (all these
references are in the Valley...I don't get out much) near Riverside and
Hollywood Way is a common hangout for studio types, and the Horseshoe
Cafe on Ventura near Van Nuys Boulevard is a trendy college place. 
Both make great mochas.

      Beyond that, I don't tend to go to clubs or trendoid places, I
stay home and I write.

"Touchy, touchy!  What's up Joe, hectic schedule or too many late
nights on the web?"

      No, I do sometimes get annoyed by people whose worldview is so
small that they think that interrogation began with "The Prisoner" TV
show and don't seem to know anything about the real world...and want to
narrow you down to their view by saying that what you did springs from
there, rather than the aforementioned real world.  Fine, I'm glad that
you've seen the Prisoner...now read a book or two about what happens to
political prisoners in the real world.  Then we'll talk.

     Further, as a writer you strive to create something
original...and when someone comes along and says, of something based on
the real world, on research, on stuff I encountered while getting my
degree in clinical psychology, on years spent supporting PEN and
Amnesty International, "Oh, you were just doing "The Prisoner"...it
tends to grate.

"So where did the inspiration for the interrogators attire come from.
You know dark suit, the hint of gold trim and buttons on the collar."

      Well, if you paid attention to the show you'd know that's a
standard business suit which we've used many times before and
thereafter; we literally pulled it off the rack in wardrobe.  You saw
that as a Prisoner suit because that's what you wanted to see.

      The problem isn't in the object being perceived; the problem is
in the narrow world view of the perceiver who bends everything to fit
what he knows.

                                                                  jms

elements differently.

      The *problem* is that it didn't happen that way, for starters,
and it makes it into something more appropos for a fanzine.  Basically,
if you spent all summer building a car, and somebody said you just
bought it from somebody else, no matter how nice that other car might
be, how good it would be to be associated with it...you put in a hell
of a lot of work building it, and to be offhandedly told otherwise is
annoying.

      And, again, it just diminishes the implications, makes it
safe...it's not about the real world, it's just about the Prisoner.

      Yes, the Sunday 1:30 presentation is still on.  What follows
after is not clear; I'm supposed to be autographing, but the program
mentions the HE interview, so I'm not sure what's up there.  The
opening ceremony was over quickly, so you missed it...but I did a
couple of other panels during the day, as well as a quick blip-in at
Hour 25.

                                                                  jms
