      Actually, I was in the shower...and I don't usually have a
computer there, as it's rather dangerous.

      "I wondered if you know what you'll be doing after (B5 is) all
over."

      Depends.  WB is very interested in the sequel series, and we
hope to have some info on that by the end of the month.  That I'd
definitely want to do.  Barring that, I'd like to find a show or a
structure where I could push the envelope again but in a different way.
If I can't find a show like that, or create one, I'll go back to prose.

                                                                  jms

Why weren't others willing to take a chance with B5?  Because it was
something new and different, or because you wanted to tell your story
your way and they didn't like that?

      Two primary reasons why it was a hard sell: 1) SF has *always*
gone way over budget.  The "V" series singlehandedly nearly destroyed
Warner Bros. Television.  Producers always said they could do it, and
they lied, and the studios and networks were very skittish.

      2) They're skittish about SF in general, and space stuff in
particular. We were told, repeatedly, in verbatim terms, "No space
series other than ST has ever survived more than a couple of sesaons. 
There is no market for space SF other than Star Trek.  The market won't
sustain it, isn't big enough to sustain it."  That was, hands down, our
single biggest stumbling block.

                                                                  jms

  Well, now I don't feel so bad.  I realize my brief, occasional
scribbles don't come close to yours (or anyone else's), but I've found
that when I try to put pen to paper, either it comes flying out at top
speed, or it doesn't come out at all.  That, and I tend to avoid heavy
re-examination of what I've done - if I look at it too long, I start to
second-guess myself.

written in just a couple of days; the ones I nurse and revise and futz

I just read about your as yet fully formed concept of a B5 spinoff
involving the rangers. I would like to know some of your specific ideas
regarding this proposal.  1. Does the story take place before, during,
or after the 5 year B5 arc? 2. What characters, assuming you
can sign up the actors, would be involved?-Dellen, Marcus, Lanier,
Sinclair ?

      It would take place after the main B5 arc.  As for specifics on
cast, nothing can be said until things get closer to being nailed down;
there's still a lot that can change on this, and it's a question of
what works best for the show, and who wants to move on, and other
aspects.

      I had nothing to do with the marketing of the series itself, so
I can't affect that either way.  What I'd do different with the
show...I'd just love one more chance to adjust every episode, but
that's an after-the-fact thing. What I'd do different otherwise...I
dunno.  Maybe nothing.  You take a different tack, you just run into
different problems, never fewer problems. So it's hard to say. 
Overall, I'm as pleased as anyone can be with a show.

      Actually, I rather like most British cooking.  My problem at the
last Wolf was that the dining room was open for only -- what? -- 15
minutes at a shot, and never when I was either awake or not on a panel,
so all I had for four days, except for when we chose to go elsewhere
(and that was difficult) was fish&chips.  Four days of fish&chips.  It
will drive you mad.  So finally, on Sunday morning, after the
restaurant had closed (having expended its fifteen minutes of food) I
planted myself in the restaurant regardless, and explained that unless
I had a proper breakfast I was going to go out into the hall and do my
version of Night of the Living Dead and start eating the flesh off the
first person I encountered.  They saw the crazed look in my eyes, and 
wisely fed me.

The entire 1000+ years at once?  What were you doing when that
happened?  So I am assuming the details have come as you've written the
episodes and it was the overall scheme of things that came to you?

When did you see the end of the story?

Thanks for taking the time with these questions.

in as I went, in terms of the backstory and forestory of the B5
universe.

      Our budget is under $1 million per episode, and we have run
slightly UNDER budget every season, which I think is a first for any SF
series.

      To convince WB we first had to make the pilot, show we could do
it responsibly, and get the ratings, THEN we got the series order.

      It's affected me in that it has put me in touch with the
audience, which is a rarity in TV, where all you usually get are the
raw numbers.  It's given me a sense of the room, as it were.  It's kept
me answerable and responsive, and that has the side effect of keeping
you modest and honest.

      It hasn't substantially affected the B5 storyline because the
story is the story; any big committee, network or otherwise, will only
work against you at the creative level.

I'm wondering, Joe, do you at all know Harlan Ellison? I'm a fan of
his works...

As a literary SF lover, I'm sure you've read Asimov. My favorite works
of his are the Foundation novels (atleast the original trilogy... the
only one I liked of the later four was "Foundation's Edge", and even
that paled in comparison with the original trilogy). I'm also an avid
fan of his robot novels...

Do you, with all your responsibilities, still have time to delve into
the realm of literary science fiction?

 (This didn't seem to be *that* bad a question, so I figure you might
  have missed it the first time I sent it.  If you ignored it on
  purpose, then just ignore it again -- I'll get the drift.)

Joe,

    Should we assume that Major Atumbe isn't part of the command staff
of the Army of Light?  I take it that he/she's still third in command
of the station (although why was Delenn running C&C in "The Summoning"?
I know, Atumbe works the night shift...), but not in the command ranks
of the AoL.

    I say this, because you would think Atumbe'd be present at some of
the important War Council meetings if he/she were involved in that side
of things (I mean if Zack, a sergeant, is present, you'd think Atumbe,
a major, would be present).

    I realize that production-wise, it simply isn't realistic to cast
someone to play Atumbe and, essentially, add a new regular character,
so that's why I'm going on the assumption that Atumbe is part of the B5
chain of command and not part of the AoL chain of command.  Is this a
fair assumption?  Will Atumbe ever be seen or the character's role in
things ever addressed?

Thanks,

  -- Brent (who, for some reason, thinks about these obscure details

Subject: TD: Rod Serling

This New Year's the Sci-Fi Channel ran a Twilight Zone marathon, and I
watched Rod Serling's little gem called "The Monsters Are Due on Maple
Street" for the umpteenth time, and am compelled once more to marvel
publicly at the genius of this man. He could pack so many levels of
meaning into a brief 30 minute screenplay, and without a single special
effect in sight.

My age hadn't quite hit the double digits when TZ first aired, so I
guess I wouldn't have realized it then, but he did quite a lot of
pieces that referred in some way to the Blacklist and the McCarthy era.
And I noticed that Art Carney's character in the Santa Claus teleplay
was named "Corwin". Did he know Norman Corwin?  Serling himself was
never blacklisted, was he?  But clearly the issue affected him deeply.

Subject: TD: Rod Serling

       Everyone who came up as a writer during that time was in danger
of being blacklisted or greylisted, or at minimum knew other writers
and actors who had been listed and had their careers killed.  Some
actors, like Jeff Corey, didn't work again for almost 20 years.  So
certainly it had a profound effect on Serling and others.

       As for Corwin...yes, Rod was a big fan of Norman's work, and
cited him as a kind of writer's writer.  He began trying to do
Corwin-like stuff, as did Bradbury and many other writers.  Norman is
one of those writers whose work may not be known to the public as well
as it should, but writers, any writer interested in genuine quality of
language and vision...we know his work. People like Bradbury and Stan
Freberg and Charles Kuralt and others have all described themselves as
"Norman's kids" for the inspiration he has provided.

Subject: The Nature of Shadows

Joe,

In "Interludes and Examinations", Morden had to physically open the
door to Kosh's quarters in order for the Shadows to enter even though
they appeared to pass through the walls.

In the the "Garibaldi's Last Stand" scene in "Babylon Squared" and
"War Without End Pt 1," it was implied that those attacking had to cut
through the walls in order to invade (and the hole was not
Shadow-shaped).

Why is this? Or will this be covered later this season?

 ----- Re: Infringements of STAR TREK Copyrights and Trademarks

Dear (name here):

I write as attorney for Paramount Pictures Corporation ("Paramount").

As you are, no doubt, aware, Paramount owns all the rights to the
television series entitled STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION, STAR TREK:
DEEP SPACE NINE, STAR TREK: VOYAGER, and all theatrical releases
relating thereto (collectively the "STAR TREK Properties"). These
rights are protected by numerous copyrights trademarks in both the
programs themselves and the characters, sets, and other elements
appearing in those programs.

We have recently learned that you have posted various elements of the
STAR TREK Properties on your site at (web site address here). Your
posting of these items is an infringement of Paramounts copyright and
trademark rights in the STAR TREK Properties.

Paramount does not, of course, object to all materials posted on the
Internet relating to the STAR TREK Properties. For example, Paramount
does not object to the general discussion of "Star Trek" over the
Internet. However, when such discussions rise to the level of copying
full scripts or excerpts therefrom, or providing detailed summaries of
the works, suck transmissions are clear infringements of Paramounts
rights. Similarly, posting of copyrighted material such as photographs,
artistic renditions of "Star Trek" characters or other properties,
sound files, video clips, books or excerpts thereform are likewise 
infringements of Paramounts rights.

Based upon the foregoing, we hereby demand that you confirm to us in
writing within ten days of receipt of this letter that: (I) you have
removed all infringing materials from your site, including all images,
sound bites, and video clips; and (ii) you will refrain from posting
any similar material on the Internet or any other on-line service in
the future.

The foregoing is without waiver of any and all rights of Paramount
Pictures Corporation, all of which are expressly reserved herein.

Whats Wrong? Viacom Has Every Right To Do This!

True! Even I must agree. Viacom's action seems so reasonable ... and
yet to completely idiotic as not to be believed!

One thing must make clear at this point. IF a site private Star Trek
Properties for use in commercial manner or in any other way related to
commercial activity, then Viacoms action is a just one. But what
happens here is very different. How can a site maintained by a 14-year
old kid be a thread? Most sites were created and maintained by Star
Trek fans, these sites never charged a single cent. These sites were
created as a publicity and promotion mean to introduce others to the
show. It is these sites that saved Paramount billions in advertising.
It is these sites that snow ball paramounts income in the first place.

Star Trek had been and shall continues to be Paramounts valuable
asset. What makes Star Trek successful is the fans behind the show. It
is the fans who frock to theater to see the Star Trek movies; it is the
fans who pay for memorials; it is the fans who promoted the show to
others. For some mysterious reason, Viacom also think it is the fans
that is hurting their profits???

Is Viacom stupid enough to believe one will settle for an poster image
instead of the real thing? One will be satisfy by owning a 10-second
sound clip instead of a sound track? One will opted for a 20-second
video clip instead of the video tape or laser disc?

Internet was a place for freedom of speech, and I fail to see Trekkers
had abused their right. On the contrary, images, sound clips and video
clips are more like a bate to seduce us to buy the real thing  and in
return, put our hard earned cash into Paramounts pocket.

I sincerely hope Viacom will come to its sense REAL SOON. Otherwise,
the Trek community will become so hurt that it might not exist any more

If you want to learn more about this disaster, use the site
http://www.stwww.com/viacom.html as your starting point to learn more.

If you feel it is time to act, please write to Viacom or Paramount and
let them know your feelings.

:) Rgds.

Subject: Paramount STRIKES!!!

      This is a most unfortunate development.  But there are some ways
you can try to deal with this constructively.

      Last year, WB became aware of the existence of many BABYLON 5
sites, and the Legal Affairs Department was of a mind to take similar
action (as has been taken by other shows, including the Simpsons).  The
reason for their desire is simple.  It's not that the sites present a
*threat* per se, but there is the issue of copyright protection at
stake.

      To explain...and this may help you to at least understand
Paramount's position, even if you don't agree with it...if copyrighted
material begins to be passed around freely, and copied, and
redistributed, and published, without the proper protections,
eventually the material will become *public domain*. The studio no
longer owns it.  In order to demonstrate that you own the material, you
must make consistent, and conscientious efforts to protect your claim
to that name and/or that property.

      Many companies and individuals have actually *lost* the right to
the copyright of material they own or created because they did not take
steps to actively protect it.  Which is why you often see
advertisements from companies like Xerox reminding people that it's a
*company name*, and not a generic term for photocopying.  Otherwise
they risk letting that name become a word, part of the vernacular, and
as indefensible as saying "tissue paper" is a copyrightable term.

      When material from a show is posted without the proper copyright
protection, every time you allow this to happen it moves that material
further and further into public domain.  Once it *becomes* public
domain, the studio will not be able to profit from it, ownership
questions come up, and outside agencies can produce anything they want,
slap that name on it, and sell it. It's a cumulative effect, over time.
And it *is* a real problem; don't delude yourself by saying so because
you *want* it not to be so.  The law is the law is the law.

      When this came to our attention, we (acting sort of as fan
advocates) sat down with WB legal and discussed ways of doing it short
of sending out these exact sort of letters to BABYLON 5 sites.  What we
came to was the following understanding: that WB would not actively go
after sites which used B5 photos and other material PROVIDED THAT the
proper copyright information was appended to the material utilized. 
They are currently in the process of verifying and evaluating sites
before sending letters telling them to append this information.

      This seems to me a fair and reasonable response to what is, in
truth, a genuine concern.  What may help here is for system operators
of web sites to append the copyright information, and notify Paramount
that they are in full and complete compliance with copyright, and
acknowledge formally that Paramount is the owner of all copyrighted
material posted on that site.  They may, or may not, accept that, but
it gives you a place to start.  Obviously, magazines use copyrighted
images all the time, and Paramount makes no effort to stop that...but
if you look in the edges along photos and the like in these magazines,
you will see the words "photo copyright (c) 1997 Paramount Television."
That is the difference that allows them to use this material. There is
no immediate reason why sites should be viewed in any way differently 
than a magazine, IF the laws are followed.

      (Interestingly, there's a debate in the TV community about the
copyright of the original ST being in some dispute, since for about 10
years Paramount did little to protect the name of the original ST,
until the first movie came around.  I have no actual information on
that, however, nor can I comment beyond just remarking on the topic. 
If there *is* any merit to it, that might further explain their
reasonable concern about it happening with current material.)

      So point is...the concern expressed by Paramount is legitimate,
and you should abide by it, OR see if you can find some compromise
position by adhering strictly to the copyright laws in how material is
displayed, and what material is selected, as we have done with the B5
sites.  You may also want to write to those currently running the ST
franchise to see if the producers of the show can intercede on the
behalf of ST fans as we did for B5 fans. Lawyers have little or no
vested interest in the fan/show relationship; those involved directly
in these shows, do have a vested interest.

      Usual disclaimer: I am not an attorney, and can only speak from
anecdotal information, and have no specific information about
Paramount, and am in no way suggesting any difference of opinion with
their actions.  I'm only trying to help you understand the issues
involved.

                                                                  jms

Everything you say is correct, of course, but I'm convinced that with
the Viacom/Paramount decision much more is at stake than the mere
protection of their copyrights.  If that were all they were concerned
about, less draconian action, like the action taken by Warner, could
have been chosen.  I'm convinced that the MSN site has everything to do
with their decision.  Many fan sites were far superior to anything over
at Continuum (I don't belong to MSN and don't intend to, but a friend
does for her business, and I've seen the site), and thus in direct
competition with the exclusive, money driven MSN site.  Of course I'm
sure you know all this, but I'm just raising the point.

      Urk...I'd forgotten about the MSN site.  I wonder also if there
is any advertising at that site.  That might also prompt them to want
to drive people there for ST material, so they can ensure there's only
one place in town to get it, and then collect ad revenue.  Nothing
wrong with advertising on a web site in and of itself, of course; it's
a natural progression that will, in time, give sites greater resources
to do stuff.  Most web sites are "dead web," interesting to look at,
but with the resources to make the site very deep.

      They're not passing through the walls, they're just phasing into

Subject: Hour of the Wolf

Joe,

        WWOR stationed in NJ, which also happens to be my NY station,
threw me a curve ball this week by airing B5 Saturday night at 8:00
p.m., and then again on Sunday night at 8:00 p.m.. This has me
wondering if they're thinking of moving the show back to its Sunday
night slot at 8:00, which they abandoned back on September 26th when
they moved it to Saturday nights at eight.
        At any rate, I ended up watching the same episode back to back
both nights, which really didn't bother me because it's a pivotal
episode which I enjoyed. I'm writing you this because I must tell you
that I've gotten such a kick out of the way in which he handled
bringing Emperor Cartegia into the arc. When first we see him, he's
sporting a new hairstyle not fitting with Centauri tradition. Right
away this is a sort of "heads up" for the viewer to take notice of, but
it's not clear why. Does he view this new trend which he's stirred up
to be "chic," perhaps simply because he is young, or is he somehow 
mentally and\or emotionally off balance? He's smart enough to assess
Molari during the first meeting that we the viewers get to see between
these two men, and we know he's up to something, though we're not sure
what. It all becomes clear once he spouts his "deification" speech to
Molari, and I must commend you on handling the scenario most
effectively. It is not until this point that both we and Molari get to
truly see the Emperor for what he is for the first time --insane. <G>
When Molari first enters the room he is so alarmed, so irritated, so
utterly frustrated by what the Emperor has done that he dares to grab
at his arm as if he were scolding an incorrigible child. Only moments 
later does he realize what he's truly up against, a mad ruler, and his
utter speechlessness upon listening to the Emperor's insane notion is
priceless! <bg> It is also a true credit to Peter Jurasik as an actor,
who earns more of my respect for him as a performer on a seemingly
regular basis.
        Anyway, just a little aside about something which I
particularly appreciated. I know that what we're looking at when we see
Cartegia is a reincarnation of Caligula, but it's all just so much fun
to watch. :) This episode also got me wondering about how Morden will
meet his end, and at whose hands, Molari's or the Shadows.
                Cheers for producing such quality entertainment!  ;-)

jms -

Upon rewatching "...Wolf" one slight question occurred to me:

When Kosh was "tutoring" Sheridan and set up the Moment of Perfect
Beauty, did Kosh have the Lorien experience in mind as something for
which to prepare, or was the relinquishing of the pin leading to an
interesting encounter more to do with authorial artistry?

 -rje-

I can almost feel the rustling-in of some kind of enchantment already.

Speaking of CD's, does Chris Franke have a definite release date for
the second music CD yet? I know the Sonic Images web page says January
but it's January now. Also if there is a release date is it a US only
date or world-wide. I'm over in the states at the end of the month so
if it is a US release date I'll have to have a look out for it whilst
I'm there.

Subject: Killing Kosh2 etc.

Hi!

A couple FTA questions if you have the time:

During the battle between Sheridans forces and Kosh2, why didnt they
allow Kosh2 to escape once he broke out of his encounter suit?  Were
they concerned Kosh2 would take them all out before he left?  Or were
they unaware he was trying to make a getaway?  Or did Sheridan really
want to kill him - was that Sheridans ultimate goal or would he have
been satisfied if Kosh2 left the station when Geribaldi asked him to?

And why did Kosh2 leave through the ceiling instead of the floor
(which should be the faster way out right? -- or was he too busy
fighting with Kosh1 to notice)?  How far can a Vorlon travel and how
long can they stay in space without a ships protection?

Also - Delenn prizes life.  How does she feel about Sheridan murdering
one of the ambassadors?  She seemed to have a sick look on her face
when she was watching Kosh2 being shot down.  Did she support Sheridans
decision, and will it affect her perception of the man who has returned
from Zhadum?

Wow - more questions than I meant to ask  And I can think of 100 more,
but Ill stop bombarding you.  I appreciate any insight!

Thanks!
Debbie

       The idea was to force Kosh2 out of the station, to where it
could be destroyed outside with a minimum of damage to the station. 
Delenn wasn't happy about it, but also recognizes that war means
sometimes having to kill somebody.

      It doesn't need to be a BIG audience, but it does need to be big
enough to make a profit.  And that's what they didn't know.  Since
then, they have made a very tidy profit on B5 already.

       "Why hasn't this been done before?"

       To which the only answer is...because nobody's done it before. 
(At least, here in the US...in the UK similar things have been done for
some time, a la The Prisoner.)

       I guess mostly it's because in TV, the question is always "are
we going to last 9 weeks?" and nobody thinks that far ahead.  To set
things up that you won't pay off for *years* takes someone a little
insane, a) to believe you'll be on the air that long, and b) to count
on the audience to be patient enough to wait for things to unfold.

       And over time, I do think you're more likely to see more of
this sort of thing as B5's impact grows over the coming years.

       My general sense for what comes next for me...assuming the B5
sequel goes...I've done a hard-linked and extremely intense drama with
an adventure component...and now, having done that, and proved that it
*could* be done, despite many who said it couldn't, my feeling now is,
"Okay, we've done that, how can we tweak it so that the sequel has a
different feel to it?" So I'm looking at something that's a little more
in the adventurous mode, with a serious underpinning, with an arc to it
that's not quite as intense in tone, but is still good drama. 
Characters that grow and change, a definite ending, several mysteries
enclosed inside other mysteries, with a much larger canvas, and an even
stronger sense of wonder.  B5 I did to prove a point, to some extent;
now I'd like to try something where, having achieved that, I can sit 
back and, knowing the format now, have some fun with it.  Maybe turn
it on its head in a few places.

       As with everything else I do, I try to find what I'd enjoy as a
viewer, and take it from there.  That was how B5 came about, and that's
how the new show would come about, should it happen.

                                                                  jms

sales. I get a piece of the *net* profit, and since the numbers are
always jigged so that no TV show or movie ever shows a profit, we know
how much that will result in...zilch.

Subject: Atn: JMS- Story Arc

{original post had no questions}

       Just one problem: I never SAID "Crusade" would not have a story
arc. I have only said that it won't be as *intense* an arc as that on
B5, because the tone is somewhat different, because I don't want to do
the exact same thing twice.  But it will have an arc to it.

       My suggestion: wait until you see what it IS before you ask me
to make it what it's not.

       No, that's the standard practice in town.  Actors have sued for
their net of shows that have been in syndication for 25-30 years, and
been told that it's "still in the red."

       Here's the insidious part of all this...they say they want a
ratings system, but of *course* it won't be used for censorship
purposes, they just want it for informational purposes...and the system
wasn't even in place for a week before pinheads like Rev. Wildmon were
out there calling for a boycott of EVERY show rated TV14, on the
grounds that it shouldn't be on TV. (Leave out the insanity that you
only have to create a TV15 rating, make all the TV14's another
category, and suddenly *they're* okay, the same programs would be fine,
if there were another nastier category.)  It's the same thing that 
happened with record ratings, which were instantly used to pressure
some record stores into not carrying more mature fare.

       It sucks.

      The Minbari approached with their gun ports opened...but they
also hadn't locked on.  They were a potential menace, but had not gone
into the territory of definite menace...and when they fired, it was
clear from the moment or two it took to respond that the Minbari ships
weren't ready to attack.  So he chose to cover his butt rather than
take responsibility for screwing up a first contact situation and
plunging Earth into a war.

      Yes, more writers and folks at the studio/network levels do know
a little from SF, but not as much as should be.  I think that will
continue to change with time.  Now that B5 has broken the strangle hold
of "no other SF than Star Trek has ever been profitable on TV," I think
maybe it'll have a positive effect.

      Our visibility is increasing, no mistake, but we still haven't
hit critical mass, and most viewers/reviewers are still largely unaware
of us. But that's okay, I went into this figuring this would be a long
haul.  Once the show is done, it's done, and nothing will ever change
that; the only thing that will change is the size of the audience.

      I dunno...sometimes I think that's the *problem*.  It used to be
the case that network suits stayed in one place for a long time, and
held sway for years...now you've got kids coming in who know nothing
BUT TV running the show.  The median age at the networks is very low
these days, and the turnover is quite high.  The longer you can stay at
the job (within common sense limits) the more confident you can get and
start taking some chances (until you get TOO comfortable, natch).  Now
the rule seems to be "cover your ass and don't make trouble" competing
with "I've gotta do something big to make a splash so I can get a
better deal with I go to another network."

      Very few people make decisions based on what they think will
work, it's all based on research now, focus groups and other means of
being able to point to someone else and say, "I did my job, research
said it was a good show, it's not my fault."

      Most of the really imaginative work being done in TV these days
is happening in cable, frankly.

      Well, you're looking at very different scenarios.  A "sneak
attack" a la Pearl Harbor is against a nation that is not at war.

      In the Black Star situation, Sheridan's ship was damaged, and
they used that to lure in the aggressor ship (which was coming in to
eliminate them) and destroy it.  They were already at war, and they
were taking drastic steps to keep from being destroyed themselves.

      In the Z'ha'dum situation, again, there was a war of aggression
on, pursued by the shadows.  In wartime, one does sometimes bomb the
capital cities of aggressor nations, from Iraq to Dresden to Tokyo, on
and on.

      But neither situation is in the *least* comparable to a sneak
attack. Was there cleverness?  Sure.  But sometimes you need that to
beat a technically superior enemy.

                                                                  jms

       Back at you:

       WB did a focus group for B5.  Peeled of 20 folks for an in-room
review, the rest of us watching through mirrored glass.  One guy hates
the show vehemently, keeps saying it's not science fiction.  Finally
the guy running the group says, "Could you tell us what you feel is an
example of good science fiction?"

       And the guy says, "Power Rangers."

       I damn near went through the glass at him.

       Yeah, that's common...one person wants more EFX, another more
character, another more arc...and if it doesn't have one of those
things, that which works for them best, sometimes it gets written off. 
That's one of the things you learn in workshops...that you didn't like
it doesn't mean it's bad, only that it didn't work for *you*.  But on
many occasions I've seen a note from someone who felt that, because it
had no CGI in it, it was perforce bad.

       Which is why, in the final analysis, one must listen to the
small voice in the back of one's head when writing.  If networks
comprise one sort of committee, fandom -- well-intentioned as they all
are, and as sharp as they all tend to be -- is still another (and
larger) committee, even more diverse. As you say, there's no one thing
the fans want...they're not some monolithic group...they're a diverse
and fasacinating group.

                                                                  jms

      I think a *lot* of people wonder about me.

      And it doesn't have to be done by one person; the third year it
came about because so much was changing, so much was happening, it made
it hard to bring in anyone...in year four, I've had to structure this
extremely elaborate tree so I can flip either way depending on whether
or not we get a fifth year, and again you just can't farm that out in
any realistic way.

      I'm *very* much looking forward to never, ever doing this

      No, the figures are correct.  DS9 does rate higher than B5,
though it's lost about 18% of its ratings over the last year, according
to the trades, while B5 has been gaining over the same period of time. 
Interestingly, on a head-to-head basis with new episodes, we're
generally only about half a point behind Voyager.  DS9 averages a
couple of points ahead of us.

      BTW, I found out the other day that apparently when Scott Adams
had done the Dilbert cover story, he'd intended for B5 to get the
cover, but the folks at TV Guide put Star Trek on at the last minute
because they felt it would sell more copies.

Subject: B5 director

{original post had no questions}

      Thanks.  Mike is one of our core directors; he wasn't available
to us for the first batch of episodes because another show locked him
down before we got renewal notice for year 4 (you can't book directors
if you don't have a commitment), but he's directing one now, and is
going to do a bunch more. He's a great visual stylist.  If I know we're
going to have him as a director, I'll actually write the script a
little differently and call for the kinds of visuals I know he can give
us.

      Funny story...turns out that in Spanish, "vejar" means to abuse,
degrade and humiliate.  So one day, all the crew vanished from the set
mid-day and reappeared moments later wearing bright red shirts with
black type reading "I'VE BEEN VEJARED!"  They're still very popular.

      Fortunately, most studios don't know what they want...they only
get into it if whatever it is, isn't working.  B5 is working, so they
leave it alone. Also, I think they know by now that if a project I care
about is going to be bastardized...I walk.  I've done it many times
before, and wouldn't hesitate to do it again.

      It's got nothing to do with making money...if you look around,
aside from the cartoon stuff, NO WB series are out on disk or tape,
because that division prefers to deal with guaranteed big sellers
(Batman, etc) than with TV, which they feel is kinda below them.

       It's a combination of things, and very hard to explain.  I come
to a given episode knowing I have to do X...X might be "this is the one
where I have to plant the info about the giant space ferrets," or "this
is the one where Lennier gets nailed in bed by Londo."  Then I kind of
check in on the characters in my head...I know what they've been going
through, and I see how they're feeling about it, where they are, what's
going on...then I sit down and "watch" the events in my head like
watching a movie, or watching the news. Some scenes are vaguer than
others, so I keep replaying it in my head until I can see the whole
thing...then I write it all down.

       In the latter case you mention, having nothing, and being under
the gun, I always, *always* start with character rather than a series
of incidents or plot points.  Because character is the key to
everything: plot, structure, all of it.  All you need to know is who
your character is, what he wants, how far he will go to get it, and how
far somebody else will go to stop him.  The rest follows naturally.

       I walked off THE REAL GHOSTBUSTERS when they decided to soften

when they decided to give the sponsor (Mattel) more control over
stories...and others.

"So in other words, you like it here (the Nets) and you do what you do
(make great stories) because you're having fun, and you don't
compromise on principle.  That must be hard in the town you're in."

      Not really.  Not as long as you know what you're in the business
for. I'm a storyteller.  The rest is superfluous.  And it's not really
that hard because I live a sensible life...if they take it all away, I
should still be okay, and I can go back to writing books, or teaching. 
A story is a story, doesn't matter to me which venue it is.  Where this
town gets you is if you're in it for the money.  Money's nice, but
doesn't really mean that much to me...you can only sleep in one bed at
a time, drive one car at a time, eat one meal at a time...how much do
you *need*?

"Joe, you are a truly remarkable man, much like the ancient Bards of
old.  In my humble opinion, you are Shakespere and Homer wrapped up in
one."

      Not a chance.  If I work hard and write my brains out, then in
20 years *maybe* I'll be fit to carry their pencil cases, but no more
than that.

      I think the main reason the Minbari have a problem with the
Black Star incident is mainly because it happened to *them*.  And even
there it's mainly the warrior caste that's annoyed by it...even though
they were en route to doing something just as reprehensible, the
equivilent to strafing lifeboats in WW2.  Frankly, I don't think the
warrior caste would give a fig who else it happened to...they're
outraged because it happened to *them*.

      I dunno...I've always been this way, seeing it in my head. 
Helps to have been a solitary-minded kid, I suppose, always off by
myself.  When I first began to read novels, I saw them in my head in
full technicolor with surround sound.  Especially with Bradbury's
stuff, which is full of imagery; I can still summon up my mind's eye
view of Usher 2, the Martian deserts with their silver windsailing
vessels, the race for the ship in "The Golden Apples of the Sun"...it's
the way I'm hardwired.

      Which is why my scripts for B5 (and most shows) are *very*
detailed; I don't just write action and dialogue, I go shot-by-shot,
close-ups, fades, juxtaposition of shots, lighting, sound, framing of
actors, all of it, to try and most precisely recreate the script (and
the episode) to look like what I saw in my head.

                                                                  jms

      Given that Paramount already pressured one director associated
with ST not to work with us, I'd rather not take that chance again.

      We choose directors based on prior work, a demo reel of their
stuff, a personal meeting, and gut instinct.  They have to understand
that the job is to service the text, not to rewrite or change.  We look
for directors whose work shows a great visual style, and who are
willing to take chances.  We get some directors who come to us because
they can't do the kinds of things they want to do for any other show. 
Here, we *encourage* them to experiment.  The worst that'll happen is
that it'll fall short.  Big deal.  If you succeed, it's brilliant.

       The deal is that what makes for a great novel is not what makes
for a great movie in most cases; novels are internal, movies are
external.  And often execs hear about a big SF book, they don't know
anything about it except that it's popular or famous, and they option
it...then find out what it is and have no idea how to make it...or what
it was...or why it works... and after buying it for what it *is* they
try to make it into something it's *not* because they're more
comfortable wit what it isn't but could be than what it is and can't
be.

       And the fact that I actually understood what I wrote and was
entirely serious in it suddenly tells me that I've been in this town
WAY too long.

Subject: B5 CD #2 is Available!

{original post unavailable}

      So what do you think?  I've listened to it about five times now,
counting the two times prior to approval, and I like it a lot.

      Here's the interesting thing, and it shows how sometimes you can
never quite shake the fanboy aspect in your (my) perceptions.  When I
first listened to the CD, and I spoke to Chris, I gave him a series of
notes, based on how much I liked the first CD, to make it more in
keeping with that.

      I went on at this for some time, and Christopher pointed out
that it was obvious I liked the first one...but that if he went along
with what I was saying, it would make the second soundtrack just like
the first one...in which case, why make it?  Which was just what I'd
been saying about wanting to do the sequel series, if it's picked up,
in a different way.

      We all come to like something a certain way, and want the next

correct, and I let it go through without changes, trusting to his
creative instincts.

      After the finished CD came in, I listened to it again at the
office, and called Chris.  "I'm glad you stuck to your guns," I told
him.  "You were right and I was wrong."

      Which is the other good thing about B5...nobody here is afraid
to argue with me if they think they're right.  I expect nothing less.

      You need to write an outline and submit it, though lately we've
been assigning books to published authors based on a premise from
in-house.  You can't just submit ideas for licenses...a company has to
approach WB with an offer and a business plan.

       We don't keep them on disk after we finish editing; in the case
of the pilot we're redigitizing dailies to go in and make our changes.

       Dailies are the actual film, developed overnight and
transferred to video.  The videotapes are then digitized, and dropped
into the editing machines.  Once editing is finished, the main disks
containing the digitized dailies are wiped; we only keep the list of
shots and frame counts for the supercomputer to use in assembling the
film.

{original post had no questions}

       Thanks.  The White Star mission in that ep has definite roots;
during WW2 to convince the Germans we weren't going to land at
Normandy, our own agents were fed incorrect information, set
loose...and then info was leaked to the Germans allowing them to pick
up the agents and torture the information out of them.  This wasn't
quite as bad as that, the crew at least knew what they were getting
into...but there are often no good choices in war.

it's very reasonable.

      Certainly there's an obsession to get this story out.  And the

       No, I think you nailed it pretty well, anything I could add
would just be lagniappe.

       Neither...I think it's just people talking to talk, to show
they may have some inside information, whether such exists or not....

       Yeah, well, when they're that small and young, they move fast,
I couldn't get a bead on her.

      I don't keep up with the general writing books, I'm afraid.

      Basically, my opinion on the novels is that they've been wildly
uneven. Some were pretty good, some just fell down, for me.  A large
part of the problem was that we went through the notion of taking
proposals for books, and 9 times out of 10 the writer wanted to tell
the story about his guest characters, and the main characters took a
back seat.  I protested and yelled, and finally decided that the only
way out was to pull novels out of my notes, and out of the series
itself.

      So novel 1 of the next batch is about Anna, Morden and the
Icarus; in my view it's the best of the line published so far, I worked
very hard with the author to keep it in line with the series; the
second novel is set on Centauri Prime, from a short premise from me,
during the time when G'Kar is kept prisoner in Cartagia's cells, and
again our characters are in the center, though I think it isn't as
strong as the first one in this batch of three; the third novel, which
I haven't yet read in manuscript form, again from an assigned premise,
follows Sinclair and Sakai to Minbar and the creation of the Rangers.

      With any luck, this batch will be very strong.

                                                                  jms
