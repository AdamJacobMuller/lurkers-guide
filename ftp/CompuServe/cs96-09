      They're going out in clumps, batches of newsletters, then
batches of kits, and so on until they're caught up.  Apparently almost
all of the stuff should be out within the next week or so.

      No one's told me about it, and it would probably conflict with
their standing license with C4, which has first rights to the show.

Subject: Hugo Award

{original post had no questions}

      Actually, no, two episodes of TNG also got Hugos.

      But what *is* significant here is that in 43 years, only 7 Hugos
have gone to dramatic TV series; 3 to the original Twilight Zone, 4 to
Star Trek (old and new).  This is the first Hugo in 43 years to go to a
science fiction TV series other than TZ or ST.

                                                                  jms

      Well, the other obvious solution, since the Vorlons were then
out and running around and actively involved in the war of that time
period, he just sent out a signal, and they got there first.

         No, you're right that it was a big deal to them, but it

Subject: Shadow Dancing CUT

{original post had no questions}

      If they cut 7 seconds, it's likely the 7 seconds of the actual
stabbing itself, which is implicit in what happens afterward, so it
shouldn't have a major effect on being able to follow the story.  It's
a reasonable edit, and about what I'd expect given the general
attitudes on TV violence among the UK TV networks.

                                                                  jms

Subject: B5 CD screen saver etc

{original post unavailable}

      The CD rom has permission for all the cast photos used in the
screen saver, and there are literally dozens of them there.  But under
SAG rules, there are strong limitations on secondary use of full-motion
clips of the actors speaking or acting in scenes from the show.  If
they were put on this CD rom, the cost of licensing the clips from SAG
would make it too expensive to buy or produce.

                                                                  jms

      What's interesting, in noting the number of votes in the
nominations, is that if we hadn't withdrawn the second Hugo nominated
B5 episode, "The Fall of Night," DS9 wouldn't have had a nomination at
all.  They moved into the nominations when we withdrew "FoN."

                                                                  jms

 SysOp Dupa T Parrot <70040.104@compuserve.com> asks:

       I don't know offhand; my guess is that it was #5 in the overall
nominations list, because (I understand) they had to jump past #6 (The
Long, Twilight Struggle) to get to #7 (the DS9 episode) to find a
non-B5 candidate for the nominations list.  So we had 3 out of the top
6, and apparently two more B5 episodes were high up on the list, I
think in the top 10.

                                                                  jms

       Well, Bruce, given that there's a massive war on, they just had
their major starbase destroyed, they were left without a platform from
which to stage the last part of the war...and here comes someone
offering a 6 mile long, perfectly empty and eminently useable base for
the last phase of the war, no charge...hell, I'd take him up on it too.

       The reaction at the con to B5, at the awards and elsewhere, was
quite amazing.  Everywhere the show was mentioned at panels, it
appaarently got applause.  The attending fans were *extremely*
friendly, went out of their way to be nice.  The two B5 panels I gave
(the second one added on when the first one wouldn't fit into the room
provided) were extremely enthusiastic. I think the two presentations I
gave that day totaled about 2,500-2,600 people total.

       When the winner was announced for Best Dramatic Presentation,
and I headed for the stage, for a moment I thought we were having an
earthquake, or there was a sudden thunder...but it was the fans
applauding and stomping their feet enough to make the ground shake.  It
was deafening down where the nominees were, and I noticed a couple of
them looking around with a "what the hell is THAT?" look on their
faces.

      No, that's pretty much uniform whether it's a big CGI episode or

{original post unavailable}

"I'm here to express opinion like it or not."

   Peter, I was trying to ignore this whole last thread, but you're
really becoming a pain in the ass.

   Lemme explain a few facts of life to you.

   EVERYONE is here to express an opinion.  What happens here is that
every once in a while, some bozo (insert your picture here) comes
riding in here and has the notion that nobody else here is objective,
that he and ONLY he dares say anything negative, and puffs up like a
pouter pigeon as proclaimer of Truth, Justice and Objectivity, and all
you poor saps out there just dang well better get used to it and get
over it.

   Seen it.

   There's LOTS of positive AND negative opinion expressed here.  It
didn't spring suddenly into being when you materialized in our midst,
Peter.  Check out the Grey 17 thread.  A number of people were iffy on
it, or downright negative.  I said they had a point, and agreed with
much of it.  So right off the bat, you are proceeding from a false
assumption, that nobody else here critiques the show.  So you're wrong
on the face of it.  Don't believe me? Check the threads.  It's there. 
And elsewhere.  Always has been.  Always will be.

   But for you, it's necessary to think, for your own ego, that you
and ONLY you DARE to stand up and speak ***THE TRUTH***.  It's how you
make yourself feel important.  And the next phase of that is that you
must now put yourself in the position of feeling persecuted for your
statements...it's not enough that you must criticize, you must feel
*special* for doing so, reinforce your own sad notion that only you are
the Visionary One here.  So you come in and you insult people, deride
them...indicate that anyone who takes issue with your hamhanded and
abusive messages is a nut, or an idiot, or a blind, ass kissing fool.

   Then you go to phase three.  It's all right in line with what we've
seen here a thousand times before.  You may think you've invented this
little dance of yours, but we've seen it before you, and we'll see it
after you. You've practically become a cliche.

   Phase three, when people take offense at what you say, is to shrug
and say, "hey, it's just wit," and "chill out."  Yessir, that'll work.

   There's a particularly offensive sort of netjerk who thinks that as
long as he says what he says in a calm, flip fashion, he can say any
stupid, offensive, chowderheaded thing he so chooses...and if someone
gets upset about it, heyyyyyy, chill out, look how angry you're
getting, you're shrieking, when I was just calmly talking about how
your mother works the corner of Sunset and Vine for twenty bucks a pop,
there's nothing wrong with that, hey, it's the world's oldest
profession, why're you being so defensive....

   That's the game you play.  And it is a game, make no mistake. 
Difference is, some of us have been around long enough, and seen other
yahoos like you come storming in here doing the same thing, to
*recognize* that it's a game. And the rules of the game are as follows:
"I can say anything I want, and that's great, but if you get upset in
response, then that's wrong, and bad."

   You want to believe that you're the Last Bastion of Persecuted
Truth, the only person who can look at things calmly, so you get other
people upset to prove your point...it's a very nice, self-contained
little mobius loop designed specifically to reinforce your own
self-image.

   If you say something, that's your opinion, and you're damn well
entitled to spraypaint that opinion all over the walls, and if anybody
doesn't like it, screw 'em...but if the other users here exercise THEIR
right to hold an opinion about your boorish behavior, somehow THAT'S
wrong, that's shrieking and screaming and being an "idiot."

   I would suggest that it's you who can't take criticsm, you who
can't abide people having an opposing opinion, on one level, because
you need to deflate it or deflect it or deride it...but at the same
time, you *need* it, you batten off it like a blood-swollen tick, you
respond to it with glee, because you think it makes you important in
their lives, or at least your own.  It's like the ten year old kid
sitting on a fence firing a slingshot at a horse, you think that
because you got a reaction, it *means* something.

   And as for saying "it's just wit," there are two primary
requirements for wit: 1) it must be funny, and 2) it must not proceed
from maliciousness. Neither of those conditions is operational in your
messages.  They are mean, venal, petty, self-indulgent,
self-congratulatory, derisive, ill-mannered and offensive.

   But they're not witty.

   That's just what you hide behind, you think it excuses any stupid,
hare brained thing you choose to spout...it's just wit, just bein'
funny.

   Like I said...seen it.

   Finally, for this:

"Joe, you comments are cute at times, but remember I tell it like it
is. If you want to talk to just yes men, and women then they're all
yours. Fail them, and they'll east you alive."

   No, you don't "tell it like it is."  That's more of your ego, your
sense of god-given mission, that somehow you know the Truth and nobody
else here has sufficiently evolved to your level yet.  Nor do I talk to
just yes men and women.  That's again your way of dismissing other
people here, writing off their opinions as "yes men" while insisting
your own is more valid because you're "objective," when you're really
just being boorish.  Nobody here is a yes-ANYthing.  There's
disagreements, criticism, even some outright knock-downs.  But you
don't see them.

   Because the universe of Peter Stathis is *just* big enough to
contain Peter Stathis, and nothing much more than that.  Your messages
are intended for the greater glorification of Peter Stathis, to elicit
persecution for the poor, embattled Peter Stathis, so that you may be
crucified on a cross of your own making because you need the pain and
the glory and most of all you need to be *right*.

   Because you are none of those.  You are, simply, ill-mannered and
in the final analysis utterly irrelevant.  The only thing more
irrelevant than you, is your opinion.  But only because it rides into
this forum stapled to a horse's ass.

                                                                  jms

       The Synanon game is (more was than is, but that
notwithstanding...) used in drug and alcohol counseling programs.  If
you'll check the psychology wing of your local library, you'll probably
find information on it there.

       Re: the scene you mention you'd've liked to have seen...it was
there, actually.  The editor of the book snipped it for length.  (I
think there were about six or seven substantive scenes deleted to bring
it under 100,000 words, which was about right for them size-wise.) 
With most of them you don't feel the absence; with some, you do.

       My appraisal: it's a decent enough first novel.  It was
strictly learn-as-you-go, having never done it before, and really only
doing it to see if I could do it, and because I couldn't find the book
I wanted to read, so I wrote the darned thing, never really figuring on
selling it.  It sat in the closet for something like 2 or 3 years
before my agent bugged me into letting her read it.  The second novel,
OtherSyde, is something of an improvement, I knew a little better then
what I was doing.  And the next novel, whenever I have the chance or
time to write it, should be even better.  It's going to be a long one,
a 1,000 page contemporary dark fantasy with some interesting edges to
it.  Got a great title for it, it's all outlined, just gotta find time
to write it.

                                                                  jms

"The truth is you don't like it when I take the show to task, but
instead of getting a calm arguement, I get nasty comments."

      Nope,  Not the truth.  Because the truth is that your opinion(s)
about the show generally take up, oh, maybe 10% of your message(s). 
The rest of your messages are all about you...about the validity of
your opinion, the need for other people to listen to your opinion, your
reactions to other people's reactions, your position relative to other
people...you have no interest in discussing the show, good or bad.  The
interest of Peter Stathis is in talking about Peter Stathis, and his
centrality to the known universe. If what you say were the truth, you
would not have titled the message that you were here to "kick butt,"
given that the only butts around here are of the users of this system. 
Check your own first message again...the "opinion" part runs about 2 
sentences out of 25.  The rest is all about you.  Then you complain
when the discussion becomes about you when *you* set the parameters of
the discussion.

      Egotism?  Peter, your ego could be wrapped around the sun three
times and still leave room for a knot.

      You came in confrontational, with no interest in the discussion
itself, only in creating a discussion *about* the discussion...a
discussion in which Peter Stathis would stand crucified on a cross of
his own making, for his own edification.

      You're worse than sad and pathetic...you're a cliche, and a
boring one at that.  We've seen your act before, Peter, and we don't

      It's *always* scary for me to go on...I'm always sure the day
before that nobody's gonna show up, and then I go into panic when I hit
the stage, and it's mainly a matter of burying that so I can get
through it and perform. These people have been there, often, for a long
time, waiting, and they deserve nothing less than a fun, interesting,
and sometimes maybe even useful show.  They deserve their money's
worth, which is why I'm so adamant about nobody getting disappointed or
cut off in line or ignored.  The second panel was a last-minute
addition when the first one got flooded out (as it werte), and after
giving my all on the first one, I was just whipped...but I wasn't about
to let anyone leave disappointed.  (As it was, I think my energy level 
was still lower than I'd've liked during the second presentation, and
a bit more rambling in structure, especially toward the end, 'cause I
was running on fumes, though so far it seems to have come off okay from
the other side of the room.)

      I think the day I ever *stop* being nervous about it, and get
either complacent about it, or take it for granted, I should stop doing
it.  But that doesn't seem terribly likely....

      Well, you combine the release of 2,000 prisoners, many of whom
were likely resistance fighters, and the payback to one who
orchestrated the bombing of Narn, and that adds up to a pretty good
incentive to get Refa even WITHOUT Londo's presence in the deal.

      No, as a rule, Harlan doesn't suggest titles; "Rock" came from
the quote from the Bible, which was later made into a gospel song, used
in the show.  So it's a real song, though I did write 2 for
"Walkabout."

      Well, given that Refa has been around for two years, and Keffer
was only in a few in one season, I'd hardly put them in the same
league.  Part of all this is how you define "major."  Usually, I've
refrained from using that term...I would say someone you've seen since
the first year, for instance, or an important character.

      Certainly I was primarily referring to Kosh in my original note
about all this...but a lot of folks took that and extended it past that
point, which I just let go rather than correct, because the show should
do any correcting.

      Yeah, I think the message of mine you're referring to are the

viewed later episodes.

       Yes, it was with the actor who plays Refa that I had that
conversation. He was initially bummed out, figured I was doing what I
was doing in "Rock" because I wasn't happy with his performance or
something. So I pulled him aside and explained the situation, and
indicated that we'd likely use him again as an alien character, under
prosthetics.  If he hadn't done such a good job, this wouldn't have
happened, because no one would've cared about the character.

       Except, of course, that going on at length about the death of
Refa would require revealing what he was doing there...and I doubt very
much that the Royal Court would like even the suspicion that one of its
own was making deals with the Narns to become public knowledge...so
it's extremely unlikely that there would be any retribution.  This is
one the Centauri would prefer to sweep under the rug, I think.

I had the editors verb up the music toward the fade out, so it had a
slightly distorted edge to it.  The details are everything in a scene

       Yeah, we've floated characters between human and alien from
time to time; we've used Wayne Alexander as a Narn, the actor who
played the Ombuds came back as the Markab doctor...we've basically got
a kind of alien rep company goig here.

                                                                  jms

       Not in the queue, but providing security within the station...
remember, many of the Narns have joined B5 security.

       Thanks.  Me, I don't much care for flames or insults...it's
something I try and avoid where I can.  It's just not worth the hassle
or the bile or the angst.  You've gotta *really* provoke me to push
that particular button. I've gotten decent at it out of survival, and
simply because I'm a writer; you've gotta be out of your *mind* to go
up against any fairly decent writer in a written medium.  You won't
win.

       But for folks like the one you describe, they're not out to
win, only to validate their existence by generating a response, proving
they exist by the echo produced by their voices.  So in that, I agree
wholeheartedly with your analysis.

       Somewhat intentional; in the long run, the show will end up
either aired daily, or stripped weekly, so either way the 14 days until

       What remarkable timing...John Copeland and I just got finished
with the main title for year 4, which is, again, different from last
year's. This time I wanted a whole new approach, on just about every
level, and designed the thing myself, working with John and the editors
to get the best shots and pull it all together.  It's *majorly* cool. 
We showed it to some members of the crew, and they're all jazzed by it,
they think it's our best main title ever.

      Specific persons, no.  I don't do that.  Never have.  I think,
in the case of someone I know who's passed away, it would be rude.  I
don't think I could handle it.  Over the years I've lost way too many
friends, and some wounds never entirely heal.  Best to leave them

       She didn't know what was coming, and that worried her.  She is
most secure when she has a definite plan of action, and variables
aren't something the Minbari are good at in any event, they're very
rigid and structured.

       And we'll be seeing the Sigma walkers again in the not too

      The script said the extras shouldn't make a big deal about
seeing her. The director did that on the set.  That's not what I had in
mind, but it isn't that big a deal...I figure she's a striking looking
woman, maybe that's a good justification.

      The ordering of credits was done to de-emphasize and hide (as

> you attribute it?

       Yes, I agree that there has been an increase in our visibility
lately. I think it stems from a number of things.  First, we've
outlived the expectations for us.  Everybody wrote us off, said we'd be
gone in half a season (including Entertainment Weekly).  We've been
stomped on, panned, abandoned, derided and left for dead.  But we keep
on going, like some kind of deranged, phosphor-dot Energizer bunny. 
Look at the shows that, unlike B5, got lots of PR, had big names
attached to them, were held up way above us by the fickle media...VR5,
Earth 2, SeaQuest, Space Rangers, Space Above and Beyond, others...and
they're all gone.  And we're still here.  We can't be ignored any
longer.

       A lot of folks are still asking, Can B5 succeed?  But in
whatever television terms you choose to apply, we *have* succeeded.  We
succeeded when we went three years, which is exceedingly rare in ANY SF
series.  Had we gone only 3 years, even though the story wouldn't have
been finished, the series itself would've been a success from a purely
TV perspective. Remember, the original Star Trek itself only went 3
seasons...and look where that led.

       Second, I think more people have at least sampled the show, and
from the ratings, more people have stayed with it, and seen what it is
we're doing. The longer you're on the air, the more folks will run into
you, even if just by accident.  Where virtually every syndicated show
has lost ratings, B5 has grown, slowly but surely.

       There comes a point where a series, any series, reaches
critical mass in terms of public recognition.  I think we're finally on
the cusp of that.

                                                                  jms

       Good point, when you do a battle like that...what do you do
next that won't seem anticlimatic?  Usually you save something like
that for your last episode of the season, not your next-to-last, or
you've blown your big EFX show 1 show early.  It makes for a real
challenge...what do you do to follow THAT up?

Peter Ledger, who before his passing helped visualize the designs of
B5: "Slippery as a bucket of monkey's foreskins."

      The logo in the center of the new poster is the one that now
hangs in the Council chambers for the League of Non-Aligned Worlds.

{original post had no questions}

      Thanks.  With "Shadow" my hope is really to erase most (though
obviously not all) suspicions or predictions on how the last one will
go.  If we already had our big EFX battle, it won't be that...Anna's
here, so it can't be that...it can't ever be a return to tabula rasa,
an empty slate, but by doing what's normally done in the season closer
one episode prior to that, it may help ease the way for a different
tonality to come in.

      And thanks again...you definitely won't be disappointed.

                                                                  jms

       Thanks.  Yours is the first detailed feedback I've gotten back
on the poster.  I designed it myself, with Jim Lockett then doing the
actual work of putting the darned thing together from the various bits
and pieces.  The feeling I wanted was of these old scrolls, found long,
long after the fact, and when you unroll them, looking up at the stars,
there are the faces of our characters, and the scroll tells their
stories....

       I actually haven't worked out what she did with the sword, or

make the new emblem.  Lemme dwell on this.

       I try not to randomly drop in significant lines without knowing
ahead of time where it's going to go, or where it has the capacity to
go.  You can't just mess with the audience that way; that was where
Twin Peaks went afoul. You just have to vary them; some things are
obviously significant, some things only become significant in hindsight
(or rerun).  It's a hard dance to dance.

       That's terrific, congratulations, and thanks for staying with
the effort.  They do pay off.

       What's been interesting is that lately, the reruns of B5 are
pulling in numbers very close to the *original broadcast*.  Everyone at
WB has noticed this, and given the number of stations that have
recently moved B5 back into prime time, or given us back a second run,
I think they're noticing as well.

       Yes and no.  The British SF shows are a different issue.  As
for American TV, no space-based series beyond the ST shows have gone on
for more than 3 years since Lost in Space.  Thirty years.

                                                                  jms

 Chas T Freund <75036.160@compuserve.com> asks:
> Or is it something else?
> If they aren't loyal to G'Kar, why not?

      Narn is somewhat factionalized itself, as is every world; there
are different followers of different denominations of sometimes similar
basic beliefs.  Catholics and Protestants are both members of the same
faith, but a Protestant doesn't recognize the power of the Pope;
neither does a Mormon, or a Lutheran.  Similarly, not everyone invests
G'Quon with the same amount of reverence or credibility.  And G'Kar can
call upon those who believe similarly to send out an expedition, but
may not have the clout in the rest of the goverment to do much more
afterward.

      And yes, initially the shadows had no interest in the Narns,
until such time as the Narns, led by G'Quon, began to engage in
sabotage and direct attacks to drive them off their homeworld.  Then
the killing started.

                                                                  jms

      Obviously the questions are better answered in the series, but I
think you'll find the answers interesting.

      As for the music, no, it's the same orchestra Chris has always
used. I've seen times when people assumed he was using synth and

      No, the White Star didn't have any substantial consciousness to
eject before impact.  It's gone.

      And thanks, on it all...G'Kar's final litany is very moving, and
the music throughout works so well...as you say, it's going to be hard
to beat.

      But that's what we do around here.  Because if we ain't pushing
it every day to get better, what's the point of living?

      Having now seen the first two finished S4 episodes...I think
people are going to be pleased.  What strikes me about the new season
is that it seems suddenly very mature, more filmic...everyone's very
excited about it here.

      Thank you, and what you say is quite true: whatever else one may
say about Warner Bros., however much we may feel frustrated about the
videotape issue, or the PR, or other elements, the stone cold fact is
that they let us make this show the way we want to make it.  They don't
interfere, they don't give notes, they leave us alone.  They trust us. 
I'd rather have that trust and do the story I want, than have all 3
seasons on tape and not have it be the series I wanted to do.  If
that's the trade-off, then I take it gladly.

      Garibaldi programmed it from the intructions given him by
Sheridan; it would've been set to explode at a certain point.  He gave
it final detonation instructions when he signaled it via his link.

Subject: BABYLON 5 SEASON FINALE

{original post had no questions}

      The reason for the difference in air dates in the UK and US is
this:

      Here we have reruns.

      We get the broadcast schedule from WB, which makes all final
decisions on this matter.  Then the show starts airing.  We still have
post production to do, and the breaks for reruns give us time to finish
the episodes.

      C4 doesn't do reruns.  They run straight through.  So if they
began the season there the same time as the US, they'd run out of
finished episodes to air right around (thinking...) episode 10 or so. 
Then they'd have to wait.

      What C4 needs to do is figure out when the earliest is that the
final cuts can be delivered, then backtrack that to when they can
start.

                                                                  jms

      One thing to also note is that when the shadows appeared, they
swarmed all OVER B5 as fast as they could, circling it without slowing
down much.  So if Draal *did* launch an offensive, it'd take out B5 in
doing so.

       Coming up with ideas is easy, as long as you know who your
characters are and what they want and what the world is like around
them.  It's like knowing what a good friend will say when they bump
their shin into the coffee table in the dark; you create any given
situation, which is itself a logical extension of the world they're in,
then drop those characters into that situation...and the story takes
care of itself.

       Most would've been getting repaired from their recent

to ship combat, or anything from Epsilon 3.  Any attack on them
would've also destroyed B5.

been, more like a quonset hut arrangment hastily erected.

      Well, I don't know if the shadow pilot was aware of the Psi
Corps research installation...they're not really aware of much of
*anything*, except their orders...I'd just suggest that there may be
something beneath that particular installation, and a reason they built
it there.

      Thanks.  Generally, I'm here for both kinds of comments...there
are brickbats, and occasional roses, and you have to learn to take them
both with a fair amount of equanimity.  Unless they're just simply
being unfair and malicious, at which point you simply take their heads
off and move on.

      But in general, I've found the criticisms here to be
even-handed, fair and often I agree with them.  The roses sustain one
between brickbat festivals.

> So what happens??

      Thanks; I think I have that issue.

      Larry DiTillio made the point, while on the show, that some SF
fans reared on ST expect everyone to talk like English earls, very
proper.  We go for vernacular every time.  I like the rough edges, the
hesitations, the stumbles.  In editing 402 the other day, there's
several takes to choose from in a particular scene, but I picked the
one where the actor slightly stumbled over the line, because it was at
the heat of the moment, and in that kind of situation, we all get
flustered.  It made it feel more real.

      Slang and idiom have been with us forever, and always will be. 
Now, on the other hand, I don't go full-tilt bozo with it, by peppering
the dialogue with lots of techtalk and futureslang because I think it
becomes intrusive. So we try to find a balance.  Some people don't like
it, and like their SF to all sound the same.  That's fine.  Tastes
vary.

      Also, I use some dialogue styles that lean toward the
theatrical, what you'd see on the stage, or hear in a radio drama. 
Other times I'm right in the gutter.  You use different tools for
different jobs.  My influences are from Rod Serling and Charles
Beaumont and Norman Corwin and Ray Bradbury, so you're going to hear
those colors from time to time, and because you don't hear a lot of
that particular style in TV these days, some people think it's 
bad...no, it's just a different approach to dialogue.

      Look at Harold Pinter, then look at Christopher Fry, then look
at Joe Orton.  Between just those three you've got three very stylized,
consistent approaches to dialogue, not like the other two at all, and
between them more diversity than in a hundred TV shows.  In theater,
which is where I cut my teeth, it's *okay* to have dialogue that's
somewhat stylized, or a bit more formal, a bit more literate, or
whatever.  In TeeVee it's all gotta be the same.  To which I say...why?

      (I've also made the mental assumption of a return to a new
formality in 2260, since styles go in and out of fashion.  People use
the word Mr. and Ms. more often, there's a more formal stance with
people you often get when a culture comes out of a major war, as we did
after WW2.)

      But dialogue tastes are utterly individual; what works for one
may not and likely will not work for someone else.  And that's okay. 
That's as it should be.  As long as the totality works.

                                                                  jms

      Sometimes there are practical considerations in the overall

she was, there was some interest in restaging things.

      Yeah, they're great; a UK company is doing a B5 calendar for

      Generally one does not give cast member A a parcel for cast

      There's always been more of a sell-through market in the UK on
tapes, so that helps.  But the bottom-line problem is that WB Video
mainly only handles guaranteed big sale stuff like their movies.  You
very rarely see ANY tv show sold on cassette from WB Home Video.  I
rather suspect they think TeeVee is beneath their notice.  We may call
in Jimmy Carter to see if he can work out a release of the hostages.

      Organizationally, no, SFWA doesn't make a big deal about who

authors tend to get more attention than non-selling authors, that's
understandable -- and within the greater SF establishment.

      And yes, Norman could win a Nebula...I only used the word
"theoretically" to indicate that his work does fall within the correct
parameters (prose, SF, book form) to be nominated, but that the odds
of such a book winning would be slim at best unless the books made a
HUGE change in direction.

      No, those were definitely shadows.

      It left me rather optimistic, yes...and generally quite pleased.
I wanted to sneak a peek at the reaction without being seen...until
somebody put the camera on me.  Suddenly I felt like Mussolini standing
in the balcony about to address a crowd, and moved away as soon as I
could.

      No, he says "you will die."  Very odd...check it again.  We used
the same audio track from before.

Sheridan.

      Be advised that your simm is, insofar as I know, unlicensed and
unauthorized, and be further advised that WB has shut down other such
unlicensed and unapproved simms.

Subject: B5 T-Shirts

      As well as going on about unlicensed B5 products, a number of
folks have been asking for info on what IS authorized.  Hence, this
note....

      One of the most popular items here at the B5 stage are the
t-shirts made by All-U.  They're color, on black, but done so in a way
that the ink and coloration isn't thick, but feels very natural with
the fabric.  They look great and wear well over time.  (They are also
the only ones making *long-sleeve* B5 t-shirts.)  We order about 3-4
cases at the start of each season, and by Christmas they're all gone. 
The crew loves 'em, and many of the cast also wear them.

      Anyway, if you'd like more info, you can order the shirts from
All-U at 1-800-424-ALLU.

                                                                  jms

       The use of the Chameleon game is fully covered by their

paying access time, that's something I don't know.  I'll have to find
out.

       I think WB does something to the tapes during the transfer in
which they insert the commercials that degrades the sound quality
slightly.

       We slide it back and forth.  Some shots are composed for
narrow, some for the wider aspect ratio.  Sometimes a character's face
is somewhat off center or out of frame for that reason.  It's whatever
looks best per shot.

       "What can they do, sue me?"

       Yup.  They've shut down several others doing this that way.

       "C'mon, like they're gonna sue a 17 year old."

       Nope, they'll just sue your parents.

       And bear in mind, you don't have to sue someone to get a
restraining order against them...which is what WB did to a couple of
other unlicensed SIMMS.  You (or your parents) just end up spending a
lot of time in court.
