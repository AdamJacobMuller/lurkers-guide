{original post unavailable}

"Is the cast under contract for season five, should it happen?.  Now
that you've wrapped the final episode, is there any danger of losing
Bruce, Claudia, Jerry, Mira, etc to other committments while you wait
to see if season is a go?"

      No, the contracts have nothing to do with that episode, we still
have options on all our cast members.

"You mentioned that you were already shooting Thirdspace, the first B5
movie. Wasn't "In The Beginning" the Minbari war story going to be
first?"

      The prequel is aired first, but produced second, because B5
didn't exist during the prequel time period, so rather than tear and
and rebuild sets, we're doing Thirdspace first.

                                                                  jms

"Speaking of cuts, I asked this question of all and sundry, but people
don't seem to know... Will B5 be released on LaserDisc or DVD ever?
Even if there are no current plans for such, what do you think of the
idea / chances?"

      I have every confidence it'll happen in the fullness of time.

"It seems to me that the White Stars (particularly in the numbers I
perceived in this Ep)  should have been able to deal with the Earth
ships like lamb to a slaughter."

      Yeah, if all you want is to slaughter fellow humans and
officers; if you want to try to minimize the body count of your fellow
officers, who you want to eventually side with you, it's more
difficult, you have to keep the kid gloves on...which endangers you in
the long run.

      Yeah, the Londo/G'Kar stuff was nifty...and yes, he's struggling
toward redemption as best he can, making a real effort, which is
important, because if he's going to end up with a Keeper on him
eventually, as we've seen, best to feel for him, which you can't if
he's a bad guy.

      Your friends are all wrong.

      One episode, "Sleeping in Light," takes place 20 years down the
road. The B5 series itself is contiguous, so S5 would be in 2262.

                                                                  jms

      What's been great about B5 has been the chance to give many
talented actors like Walter and others a chance to show the many other
hues and colors they are capable of delivering, but which were rarely
seen because the material didn't allow them the opportunity.  I know
Walter's loved it, and it's been great for us as well.

       Good point about Joan of Arc...too many people forget that sort

       Which, on reflection, may be the problem in ways a lot larger
than just B5.

       No, I wasn't in the military, just having missed the Vietnam
draft. The points you mention are all the ones I wanted to get into
with that episode, and the ones a lot of folks have overlooked in
suggesting that it should have been an episode about slicing-and-dicing
the enemy (the enemy in this case being our own species).  The show, at
root, is about ethics, among other things, and the ethical choices will
continue to get more difficult the deeper you go.  There is a very fine
line that Sheridan's walking in all this.

                                                                  jms

       Thanks...if G'Kar came around too easily or quickly, it would
ring false; it had to go through some time and reflection.  But even
though one could certainly agree with his anger over what's happened,
G'Kar has to try and overcome that and even transcend it.

       It's certainly an issue I care about quite a lot, and the
delicate balance between orders and conscience, between what you think
you should be doing vs. what you feel you *must* do, is the heart of
99% of all drama.

       See, Burhaan, this is what makes me nuts.

       When we have shows like "Rumors" or "Epiphanies" lots of people
post message saying, "What's wrong with the show, it was going great
and now it's slowed down."  Then we have a show like "Fire" or
"Surrender" and then lots of people start posting messages saying
"What's wrong with the show, it's going too fast."

       It's like having a driver sitting behind you in the car
alternately saying "Speed up!  Slow down!  Faster!  Slower!"

       Yes, some threads have been isolated from year 5 a bit, but all
in the accelleration has not been overmuch; year 4 would've ended at
418 in the original notes, so you're only looking at 4 episodes
difference.

       This is the latter part of the story no matter how you look at
it; so you have to start speeding things up a bit in places because
that's what the latter half of a novel is *for*.  Let's all remember
basic literature 101: introduction, rising action, complication, climax
and denouement.  It gets tenser and faster the deeper you get into it.

       Why this is striking people as unexpected is utterly beyond me.

                                                                  jms

"G'Kar seems to know that it's Mollari at his door -- why else would
he wait so long to call, "Enter?"  But how did he know -- was it an
official request by Londo?"

      If you recall, when Garibaldi visited Vir, Vir mentioned that
Londo was arranging a meeting with G'Kar, so it was definitely set up
in advance.

How far along are you into filming "Thirdspace"?

      Day 12.

Will it continue throughout the month of June?

      Another couple of days.

And when will filming of "In the Beginning" start.

      The very next day, wrapping on June 30th.

And approximately when will these movies air on TNT?

      January 1998 for the prequel, the second movie either 18 or 36
weeks thereafter.

One more question...Will these movies chronicle the path of all the
characters(past & present)to B5?

      Two hours ain't enough time to fit them all in.

      Because Warners is working on several options to keep the show
on the air in the absence of PTEN, and a crowded syndication market,
they've asked for, and received, a 30 day extension on the drop dead
day from the cast.  So now they have until July 15th to make it work.

      No, it isn't really a problem...the worst that could happen is
that the show might have to go on in January rather than November, but
that's only a small gap.  The stations haven't locked down their
January schedules yet, and there's always fallout from what goes out in
November, so there are still many possibilities.

      TNT has a big campaign planned for the January launch...for the

my opinion) has deserved for a long time.

      TNT has been nothing other than terrific.

      Actually, we don't really have that much more money.  Each
episode costs a tick under $1 million; for purposes of discussion,
let's round that up to 1. So you're now talking 2 million for 2 hours. 
Now you've got another million to spend.  *But* ALL the prices go up by
union scale and whatever else can be negotiated.  Actors fees go up,
writers fees go up, directors fees go up, crew fees go up...so at the
end of the day, you find you have a *little* more to spend, but not
really that much.

      As for how everyone's handling it...really no different than the
series. Actors learn their lines, directors do their shots, the
atmosphere on set really isn't much different.  The only substantive
difference is that, because we know we won't be airing these until
January and March/April, at soonest, we have more time in post and can
therefore do more EFX.

      George calculated that there are as many EFX in "Thirdspace" as
in the entire first season of B5.

                                                                  jms

      Thanks for all the kind words, from you and your wife.

      Yes, my philosophy, from what you've said and others have said,
seems close to Pal's, in that if you leave creative people alone, and
give them the creative freedom to go nuts, they'll do more for you than
if you bash them down all the time.  It's a simple notion but for some
reason unfathomable to many suits.

      As for the extension, that was something WB asked for, it didn't
originate from our side.

      And I'm very happy that the show has gotten the reception it
has; makes it all kinda worthwhile.

      It's a means of making time for them to work out the limitations
of the PTEN contract, and the new syndicated market, which has been
going through massive changes in the last year or two; basically the
market has collapsed or been driven out (depending on the market you're
in) by all the new networks and program glut.  Virtually every
syndicated show has dropped from last year to this year; the only ones
that have improved over last year are B5 (7%) and Xena (18%).  Just
about everything else has dropped bigtime.

      There is a script fee that one receives as a writer, and if you
are also a producer there is a separate negotiated fee.  The former is
set by the WGA, and can be improved by negotiation; the latter is
strictly a matter of negotiation.

      Thanks...again, excellent points.

      One thing on the line Wade speaks...the actor consistently got
the line wrong.  It read, "Everything is illusion, Mr. Garibaldi;
constructs of light, language, metaphor," rather than concepts.

we will find out more about that in a bit.

{original post unavailable}

      As a writer, the influences would really tend to be early ones,
so I'd cite Eric Frank Russell, HP Lovecraft, Bradbury, Ellison,
Tolkein, Clarke and "Doc" Smith as being at the top of the roster.  In
terms of television, it'd be Serling, Matheson, Corwin, again Bradbury
and Ellison, and Charles Beaumont.

Subject: The age of a Minbari

{original post unavailable}

      What Delenn says, if we all go back to the episode in question,
that a Minbari appeared to her, when she was a child lost in the city
and wandered into the temple; a vision, telling her that "I will not
allow harm to come to my little ones here in my great house."  (Note:
"my little ones" being a coy bit of foreshadowing to her being a child
of Valen, but never mind that for now.)

      Obviously there were many drawings and pictures and records of
Valen, but most were destroyed in the Great War.  And those that
survived have been, over a thousand years, idealized and distorted by
whichever caste is currently claiming him as theirs.  (Valen refused to
belong to any one caste.)

      Which, btw, is also what Delenn referred to in season one, when
she was lost and in fear of death, and she looked to Sinclair with
reverence and said, "I knew you would come for me."

                                                                  jms

      No, she got the letter at the time of WWE.  Remember, though,
that she was at the Battle of the Line when Sinclair was scanned and
found to contain a Minbari soul...so that would be the basic start of
it.

         Thanks.  One thing I've been doing with the latter part of
season 4 is to experiment a little more, try different things.  I feel
that we need to push visually to try new things, the sort of visual
techniques you don't see much in SF-TV, which for the most part is
fairly prosaic as these things go. And to push the writing, to try some
things that may succeed, or may fail, but you learn something either
way.  In its way, next week's ep is just as experimental, but in a very
different direction.

      Mike Vejar definitely did a great job with this episode.

                                                                  jms

      Re: your kind words about the episode...thank you.

"On a completely different and impertinent tack, I am curious to know
if you feel any impact from being perhaps the most visible atheist
since Ms. O'Hair?"

      Not really.  I think that a large sector of the religious
community is still trying to figure me out...because yes, I'm an open,
avowed atheist, but I've done stories about religion and spirituality
that -- if the mail from priests and rabbis and ministers and even a
few folks from other, non-western religions is to be believed -- are
more fair and respectful than just about anyone else in TV is doing,
even according to last week's Christian Science Monitor.

      They openly ask, "How is it that an atheist is able to get
stories of great faith on the air when nobody else will do it?"  To
which I generally have started replying, "Only Nixon could go to
China."

      I think that if I were using my show as a bludgeon to convey my
own personal beliefs, or lack thereof, as an atheist, that would be a
whole different kettle of fish.  But I don't.  I have an obligation as
a writer before anything and everything else...that means that if I
create a character who is religious, I must treat that character with
respect and, just as importantly, *authenticity*.  I must, in short, be
*fair*.

      Where this works to my benefit is that if I, as an atheist, do
an episode showing a religious character in a positive light, the mail
comes in thanking me for being fair to points of view I don't agree
with.  Then, when I do a show implying Ivanova and Talia were briefly
lovers, or when you have Marcus and Franklin undercover as a married
couple, they start to go to the keyboards to complain...then remember
what they said about fairness to other points of view.

      As a result, even with all the very subversive and challenging
shows we've done in four years, and even being an open atheist, I can
count the harrassing religious fringe-mail on one hand.  (Thinks for a
moment...okay, maybe two hands, but that's all.)  As long as I stay
honest with the writing, I'll be okay.  The moment I start to use it as
propaganda, they'll be all over me...and rightly so.

      BTW, on the issue of Madalyn O'Hair...or O'Hare, I can never
remember which it is...interesting thing is, I worked for her magazine
for a while, doing a couple of columns and articles.  At the time, I
did so because I felt (and still to some extent feel) that atheists are
easy targets in society. You will never see an avowed atheist in the
White House or Congress, whatever it may say in the constitution about
this being a secular government with separation of church and state. 
When then-Vice President Bush could say, at a press conference at an
airport in Chicago, "Well, I don't really see how an atheist can be a
patriot, this is after all one nation under God," then you see how bad
things can get.

      But in working for her magazine, I gradually figured out that
she wasn't oriented toward equal respect on both sides, for atheism and
religion, which is where I am...she was anti-religion and looking to
sabotage that element of society, which I do not condone.  It's simply
wrong.  I've always said, the day they try to shut down the churches,
I'll be the first one on the firing line to fight back...I just hope
that the other side will join me when they try to shut down the
libraries.  Which, finally, is why I resigned from her magazine.  I'm
pro-tolerance, and don't have time for bigots of any stripe.

                                                                  jms

      Nope, just figured he'd be great for the job, and cast him
without audition.  He didn't know anything about the show before that.

"You must have known, or at least suspected, they'd hold back the last
4 again.  I think I've figured out one of the reasons you're as good a
writer as you are.  You can take your story and mold it into the shape
you need it to, in order to tell it, regardless of the blockades,
changes, whims and opportunities the current syndication market throws
at you.  You're the most flexible damn writer I've ever seen.  Then
again, no one's ever HAD to do the things you're doing either."

       All I'll say is that no one will ever truly know how difficult
this process has been.  And no matter what they throw at us, we catch
it, turn it around, figure out how to use it for our own purposes, and
somehow make the story better for it.

       It ain't easy, though, m'friend...it ain't easy.

       Actually, no, you're right, ther isn't that much direct,
personal violence in the show.  My feeling is that if you do that a
lot, it loses any potential for impact.  You only pull out that card
when you really need it, to best effect...don't waste it.  It's like
harsh language, after you've heard someone going on using all the more
remarkable Anglo-Saxon words for a while, it loses all impact.

"As I recall, previously, you said that you wouldn't do any Babylon 5

      Nope.  I said that the B5 story per se ended in 5 years.  I have
also said, *from the very start*, as the old timers here, and at

could go off and be a different novel set in the same universe.  So

"I thought the fight was a bit too long for much the same reason as

doing less damage than we think, simply to prolong the "fun".)"

       1) It was for dramatic/stylistic effect.  Not everything done
with some style has to have a scientific explanation.

of a lot longer than we showed here.  When I got mugged it went on for
10 minutes.

      The schedule of new episodes is designed to accommodate sweeps
periods.

      As for the coming reruns, the theory there is to back up from
419 to the number of weeks preceding it so that the reruns ramp up to,
and run right into, 419 (first new ep back) so that folks who dived in
late will be able to catch up.

Wade had a great line about the clash of homo sapiens and Neanderthals
in Carthage.  Was this line inspired by some of the recent Neanderthal
finds? Or was this part of your orignial conception for the story?

      Not recent stuff, just a general knowledge of this area.

Did Edgars really believe the Earthgov propaganda that Sheridan was
operating under the malignant influence of aliens?

      Nope.

Is Bester really done with Garibaldi?

      For the moment.

One of the captains of the Earth vessels is named Leo Frank.  Was this
a deliberate historical reference?

      Not intentionally.

Franklin and Number One seem to have cooled their relationship.   Any
further developments in the works here?

      Any more personal stuff got set aside when Franklin showed up a)
with another female, and b) she was a teep.  When #1 calms down, they
might take another shot at it.

Lastly, there is a bit of irony in the fact that the stage for
Sheridan's capture is set when he steps aboard his old ship, the
Agamemnon.  Agamemnon was the supreme commander of the Greek forces at
Troy, who survived that long war, but who was betrayed and murdered by
his wife when he returned home. He blindly and arrogantly stepped into
a trap, as Sheridan also seemed to do.

      Yeah...that's one of many reasons why I picked that
image/reference. It plays on a LOT of levels in the story.

      Usually guest stars show up with "another job" in their
head...but by the time they leave we've converted 'em, and we often get
notes from them saying how great the experience was, and wanting to
come back.  Sometimes they become part of the extended family, and just

      Because they don't want him reprogrammed; as William says,
another teep could see that he'd been altered.  They want him
*sincerely broken*.  Not just rewired.

      And yeah, I wanted this to function almost as a play in
structure.  In fact, when we shot it, we did it in full-act chunks. 
The actors would come in in the morning, rehearse it as they would a
play, then we'd shoot it the way we'd shoot a play, straight through.

      Each narration is from that character's point of view, it's not
an auctorial intrusion.  And each is specific *to that time*.  It's not
a policy statment.  It's a means of tracking the show at various points

      Yes, he had another name or designation (Naranek is actually a
title, not a name, hence why they both had it) and was primarily being
a pain in the butt.

      It's basically a means to get the audience, which has been away
for a long time, to come back to resolve a hanging point and jump-start
them into the episodes.  If it ends cleanly, apparently a lot of folks
in any series will just forget to tune in the following season.

       It matters because there are plenty of alien teeps out there as
well as human ones, and you can always get a rogue in there.

       You're wrong.  The costumer has never even *seen* the Prisoner,
as far as I know, and the suit he wore was one of our standard earth
suits which we've used before on the show, just tailored it to fit his
form.  And the set design is just your basic black room with chairs,
nothing more.  I also doubt muchly that Flinn has ever seen The
Prisoner...which was a very well and brightly lit show, whereas this
played to darkness.

American market when making their decisions; they still view European

      Thanks...our cast invariably comes in knowing full scenes, and
can hit them without breaking or blowing a line.  So we have a tendency
at times to just let the master play out, keeping the intensity, which
can sometimes be broken by too much cross-editing.  (Note that the
Zathras/Ivanova scene a few episodes back is *entirely* one shot, four
minutes.)

      I gave Kathryn a bare-bones stucture on the Marcus thing -- the
death of his brother, his trip first to B5 and then to Minbar -- but
she took on the rest on her own.  The process was pretty much as I
describe it in the intro, asking what X meant, how A related to B, and
then her pulling all the threads together in a story that filled in all
the blanks.  The credit is entirely hers on this.  I consulted and
read, but she did all the creative work on this.

      Nothing has been decided yet, formally, on season 5.  As for
wearing glasses in the future...not everybody's going to want to get
corrective eye surgery.  I could get it right now...but I don't let
*anybody* touch my eyes for any reason, it's probably the one phobia I
have.  (Every year when my optometrist has to do the standard glaucoma
test, requiring touching my eye with a blue dot thingie, he dreads it,
because he knows one of us is going to go through the wall...probably
him.)  As for a paperless society...every time somebody says we're
coming into a paperless society, as Ivanova once said, I get 10 more
forms to fill out.

      Exactly.  The banal face of evil.  You look at most of the guys
who ran Treblinka, or Bergen-Belsen, and they're largely ordinary
looking guys, who could be accountants or repair men or car salesmen. 
They're *us*...and this was designed to remind us of that.  The evil,
mustache-twirling villain is too easy, and too far from the truth of
it.

      I'd say the introduction of an epic or saga-like structure to
the TV format.  A novel for TV, using all the literary devices of
fiction, over the course of years.  I think, in the long run, that's
what B5 will be most noted for.

       Your perception is basically correct; I kept Delenn's
background more vague to add to her mystery, and made Sheridan's more
specific and grounded to tie him more to Earth and more accessible.

      A number of items, from fairly important to not at all.

      If you are anywhere in the Atlanta area, I suggest -- fairly
strongly -- that you exert every effort to be present at the B5
Presentation on Sunday afternoon (I think it's 1 or 2 p.m.) featuring
B5 producer George Johnsen. He will have the usual assortment of
bloopers, clips from the two movies now in production, and other
stuff...and the "other stuff" is something folks should be around for.

      You may possibly also want to tune in to Entertainment Tonight
tomorrow (Friday) night.

      And definitely buy a copy of the TV Guide issue that hits the
stands Monday on the West Coast, and Saturday on the East Coast.  In
fact, I suggest you buy two.

      All of this will make sense in the fullness of time.

      Also...on a wholly different note...we're continuing our updates
on the B5 Fan Club.  The new edition of the newsletter is in its final
stages, and will likely hit the printers next week.  We're going to be
releasing some new items from thestation.com, including the new set of
B5 trading cards from Fleer at a very competitive price, with another
bunch of them for sale with the box autographed by some guy named
jms...and next week we should be putting up our first in a series of
B5-special ball caps, this one the exact same cap, made by the same
people, used in "Knives": Sheridan's Agamemnon cap, which has 
a silhouette of the Aggy and its ship construction ID number below. 
It's *very* spiffy.  More caps will be forthcoming.  (The cards are now
available via thestation.com, and the caps will be available there next
week.)

      We're also totally redesigning the membership kits for those
joining in the next few months, and are planning a massive facelift for
thestation.com as well.  We'll be announcing more improvements over the
next 4-5 weeks.

      Keep watching the skies....

                                                                  jms

       Since it's unauthorized, I really can't comment.

       It's the family Mir, not daughter of Mir.

      No, the TNT contract is not in any way affected; WB will be done
with the show this fall, as far as syndicated stations is concerned,
and then it goes to TNT.

      And the prequel will segue right into the pilot.

      Thanks should probably be conveyed to Brad Siegel, president of
TNT, who fought hard to get the show, initially beating the Sci-Fi
Channel out in a bidding war for the reruns, and who believes very
strongly in what we're doing for the future.

      We weren't able to work out a deal with Jerry for the two
movies, but he will be in the fifth season, and a third TV movie which
TNT has indicated they'd like us to do.
