      Stephen has directed 501, and I think is on tap for at least one
more at this point.  Overall filming is going great, and I think this
may be one of our best, certainly one of our most interesting seasons
to date.

      OtherSyde is actually the better book of the two, in my view.

      It's Getting Dark I shelved when I came up with a better
story...which I will write in that wonderful moment when I have
sufficient time.  About the only extracurricular project I can slip in
now on a fairly regular basis is a play I'm working on....

"We have an alleged meeting which she says she was booted and you say
never happened."

      John...let me try this again.

      The weekend this supposed meeting took place Claudia was in
Blackpool, in the UK, in front of 3,500 fans who can verify she was
there, and not in the US, let alone at a meeting with WB.  It's not "me
vs. her" on this... there are 3,500 people who saw her that weekend,
8,000 miles from the WB offices.

       This has nothing to do with who do you listen to, it's just
looking at the logistics and the realities that have nothing to do with
any personalities whatsoever.

       Unless she is capable of transubstantiation and nobody told me,
there WAS no meeting.

                                                                  jms

       Thanks..."Racing Mars" and "Lines of Communication" are more or
less transitional episodes to get the pieces in place for the rest of
the season. But once things start cranking, they don't let up for the
rest of the season.

"...her stated view is that she was told it was 22 eps. or nothing by
the Turner people.  No possible time off."

      Again, this is only a partial statement.  She was told that if
she wanted to be *paid* for 22 episodes, then the contract would have
to stipulate that she was hired for 22 episodes.  The probelm was that
she wanted to have the contract read that she was being paid for 22
episodes, but appearing in 18, which constitutes a per-episode pay
increase, which would invalidate our contracts with all the other cast
members, who are on a favored-nation basis. Had her people said, "Just
pay us for 18 episodes and we'll just do 18 episodes," there would
never have been a problem.  We did the same thing for Stephen Furst.

"Yes, when she didn't /couldn't agree to that, she was  "booted"."

      One clarification.  You cannot fire someone who does not work
for you. That is the one part of this conversation everybody keeps
forgetting.  As of June 15th, when Claudia did not give the extension,
her contract expired and she no longer worked for B5, or WB; neither
had any call or hold on her. What had to happen then was for WB to put
an offer on the table for her services. This was done.  A deadline was
finally put on for a Friday, because of the pressures of production. 
She did not accept the offer, and by that Friday, the offer was
withdrawn.

                                                                  jms

       There's really nothing you can tell these people that will
work. They will always doubt and say it's doomed...then see what comes
along, and go "...oh..." and then the next thing will happen, and
they'll do it again, on and on.  When Stephen came in, when Michael
went out, when the shadow war ended, when we got year 5...I'm more or
less used to it by now.

       Give them something to believe?

       I did.

       The fifth season.

       Either it's there, or it ain't...and anything I say doesn't
mean a damned thing, since there's always somebody who'll counter,
"Well of COURSE he'd say that."  The show stands on its own.  Always
has.  Always will.

                                                                  jms

      No, it's because with the departure of Troy, and B5 being a lame
duck show in WB's view, there's nobody at the helm over there right
now.

      No, we'll be shooting through March, and the new eps go on in
January.

      You definitely won't be seeing *new* B5 eps once per day; you'll
get the first 4 seasons daily, and a new S5 episode once per week for
22 weeks.

"HQ people have never heard of B5, and since they overloaded on Star
Trek merchandise which didn't sell, they figured it was more of the
same."

      This kills me...and I've heard it before...because when we went
on the air, some places didn't want to carry our stuff (like the
micromachines) because it wasn't (or wasn't like) like Star Trek and
only Star Trek sells...and now they are reluctant to carry us because
they think we're like Star Trek and Star Trek DOESN'T sell anymore....

      Some days you just can't win.

"She also says she was never told she could do 18 shows at 18 episodes
of pay. (whether it was her agent that didn't tell her or someone else,
I don't know)"

      Actually, if you read her statement, she does NOT say that.  She
says only that she was told that the contract would read she would have
to do 22 (if she were being paid for 22).  The 18-payment issue was
never addressed by her in any of her messages one way or another. 
You're reading something in that was never actually stated.

      Meanwhile...let me put this to you concisely.  Her manager was
told about the 18/22 situation in no uncertain terms by John Copeland. 
Now, I have an agent, same as Claudia has an agent.  When I'm in
negotiations with someone, as we're currently in negotiations with WB
for the sequel series, the agent takes detailed notes and relays
everything back to the client on terms and conditions.  Everything.  An
agent doesn't just say, "Oh, I think I'll tell my client about A, B and
C but not D, because s/he doesn't need to know that."  It simply
doesn't happen.  And at no time has Claudia EVER said, "My agent didn't
tell me this." She's simply never mentioned this aspect in any of her
posts.

"I've never known her to lie, have you?"

      Not to say otherwise, but...how long have you known her that you
can say this?  Have you known her...or have you known the character? 
I'm not saying she did here...because an omission is not a lie...I just
find it a curious thing for you to say.

                                                                  jms

"That's just it, Carl.  They're your *conclusions*.  Unless I have
evidence to the contrary, I'll take someone's stated facts over what
happened to them over the conclusions of someone who's using second
hand knowledge any day."

      A statement is not a fact.  If that were true, then my statement
would be a *fact*, and someone else's would be a *fact*.  And in that
case, nothing is true anymore.

      Let me put this to you for a change, Sue: you keep saying you
want "evidence."  Just to be brusque for a second...what the hell do
you mean by "evidence?"  What would qualify to you as "evidence?"  Be
specific.  Be as concrete as you're asking others to be.

      The cast, Bruce and Jeff and Stehen and others, have supported
everything I've said here, right down the line.  Okay, that's not
enough for you.  What is?

      You keep asking for "evidence," so you must have some concrete
notion as to what constitutes evidence.  Because short of producing
audio tapes of phone conversations (none exist), there IS no such
evidence, and you're asking for things that either do not exist, or
would violate confidenatiality (i.e., notes between Claudia and her
agent).

      You keep demanding evidence, Sue.  Okay, now I'm asking you: if
my statements, and the statements of those who were in the UK when all
this happened, are not enough...statements from credible witnesses,
myself included, that would stand up as testimony in court but are
apparently not enough for you...then what, realistically, is evidence
that could reasonsably be obtained?

      Because I think you're deliberately asking for things that don't
exist, so you can continue to split hairs and make everybody else's
opinion *just* an opinion, while you state *facts*, at least in your
mind.

                                                                  jms

Subject: from jms: merchandise

I'm putting this in a few different places, so forgive any
redundency....

We're starting to pull together the licensed B5 merchandise being put
out by the fan club, and I'm very pleased by it...especially the pins,
as noted below.  For a long time now, pirate dealers have been putting
out fake B5 Earth Alliance pins, and they've been crummily made, either
flimsy or breakable or thick and clumsy, and charging fair-sized bucks
for rotten, inferior products.  No more.  Now you can get the real
things, identical to the acual props in every single respect, and
overseen directly by Babylonian Productions to ensure that they're
accurate.  (Along with everything else here.)  But that's been a real
sore point for me for a long time, and I'm glad to have it taken care
of once and for all.

The following products are now available via the Fan Club website,
located at http://www.thestation.com (I'm omitting prices as per CIS
policy, but will say that the fanclub members get a discount on all
items).

1)  product # FCM - Fan Club Membership

This gets you the quarterly Universe Today, access to the Gold Channel
personal logs on thestation.com, and discounts on all FC products.

2) product # FCTC-01 - Fleer/Skybox Special Edition box with JMS
autograph

3) product # FCTC-02 - Fleer/Skybox Special Edition box with Bruce
Boxleitner autograph.

4) product # FCJ-01 - Earth Alliance Pin

Baked Enamel blue and gold-tone pin, just like the real ones.

5) product # FCS-04 - "The Great Maker" T-shirt

When I directed "Sleeping in Light" (422), during lunch a substantial
number of cast and crew disappeared from the set, and returned wearing
these shirts as a surprise.  A lot of people asked for these to be made
available, and now they are.  Front reads, "Shh...The Great Maker is
Directing". The back reads, "And on the seventh day we wrapped".

6) product # FCP-02 - Recognition Chart Poster

This one I like a lot because it's just stinking cool...it's a perfect
replica of the recognition poster seen in pilot ready room on B5,
struck from the same master.  It has Minbari, Shadow, and Earth ship
silhouettes, as you'd see on a WWII battleship.

7) product # FCH-01 - Aggie Hat

The product number may be revised.  This is the crew cap for The
Agamemnon, Sheridan's ship prior to being assigned to B5, seen in
"Knives" and which will be seen in the fifth season as well.  (And
thosext item:

8) product # FCH-02 - Psi Corps Hat

This is another one we've been asked to produce by fans.  The cap is
black with the Psi Corps logo on front. "The Psi Corps is your friend"
is embroidered on the back.

9) product # FCBK - Antioch Babylon 5 Calendar 1998

This is possibly the best graphic product associated with B5
publishing to date.  It's just gorgeous, with montage prints, quotes
from the series, photos galore, and many of the major events in the B5
storyline noted by date.  This is a limited edition with serialized
numbers. We have the lowest numbers available on the market.

And there are the CD's available from us, done by Christopher Franke:

  product # FCCD-01 - Original Soundtrack
  product # FCCD-02 - Messages From Earth
  product # FCCD-03 - Avalon
  product # FCCD-04 - Z'Ha'Dum
  product # FCCD-05 - Shadow Dancing
  product # FCCD-06 - Severed Dreams
  product # FCCD-07 - Walkabout

Again, all this can be obtained via the Fan Club site, which has an
order form.  Some of this has yet to be added to the form, so in the
case of short or limited orders, this will let you get a jump on things
before they're sold out.

What we're doing here is what I think should be done with this stuff:
you make what you personally would want just because you think it's
just cool....

      I note in the beinning that nowhere in your note did you cite
what you would consider "evidence."  So please refrain from doing so in
future, since apparently you can't define it.

"If someone were to tell me that *you* were lying in this situation, I
would be just as offended and just as strong in defending you."

      Sue, by taking the position you have taken in this, you are de
facto calling me a liar.  I have said clearly that the situation was X.
You have said, repeatedly, that the situation could be Y.  If it's Y
then I'm a liar. You may think this is just an academic exercise in
intellectual fairness; you are, however, calling my honesty into
question.

"I don't know any of the people involved, and therefore I'm not going
to draw any negative conclusions about anyone unless there is a first
hand account."

      Yes, you *do* know at least one of the people involved, you know
*me*, and I *do* have a first hand account.  There ain't much in the
show that is MORE first hand than me.  You don't seem to grasp here
that I *run* Babylon 5. No offers are made to agents or actors that I
don't know about.

"If you were to say "I told Claudia she could do 18 episodes for 18
pay" then I would see a direct conflict."

      Then there's a direct conflict because that is EXACTLY what she
was told.

"Claudia says she was never offered 18 episodes at 18 episodes of
pay."

      No, she doesn't say that.  Look back at what you posted again. 
I quote you quoting her.

      "I was never offered 18 episodes at a different price."

      Not the same price.  A DIFFERENT PRICE PER EPISODE.  That's what
I've been trying to get you to understand for months now.  There was a
desire on their part to get her a pay raise per episode, which would
violate our contracts with the other actors.  She wanted to do 18
episodes for the 22 price.  That only confirms what I have been saying
here from day one.

"You keep saying that *I* don't think your statements are enough. 
I've never contradicted or disbelieved your statements."

      Yes you have, by implication.  Maybe you don't see it that way,
but I and others here do.

"1.  Was Claudia told that she could do 18 episodes for 18 episodes of
pay. If you say "yes, I told her" or "I was there when she was told" or
"My good friend Bob who I know and trust told her" then fine, I would
be prone to take your word for it."

      YES, SHE WAS TOLD THAT.  FOR THE TEN THOUSANDTH TIME, SHE
THROUGH HER MANAGER WAS TOLD THIS.  WHAT PART OF THIS SENTENCE IS IN
SWAHILI?

"However, so far as I can tell, there has been no statement from
anyone who can say that she was informed."

      Sue, I sat across from her in a pub in the UK.  I talked to her
at length.  This was referenced in the conversation by me.  She was
aware of it.

"2.  Did Claudia want to do season five?  She stated before, during
and after that she wants to do B-5.  Why should I believe she doesn't?"

      I think -- and this is speculation -- she wanted to do S5, but
she wanted a pay raise, something confirmed by her comments in the TV
Guide Online magazine.  Go read it, she wanted an increase that none of
the other cast members were getting.  (And as part of that interview,
she says that all the other male actors were paid more than her, which
is, by the way, an absolute and outright fabrication.)

"Is there some reason that a new contract couldn't be drawn up for a
few episodes such as has been done with Tracy Scoggins?"

      If she wouldn't go for 18 episodes at 18 episodes pay, why
should she go for 8 episodes at 8 episodes pay?  At the point we're
talking about, we got every indication that she did not want to return
to the show, period. There were no phone calls from her or her people
saying so, nothing, absolute silence.  Now, you'll pardon me for being
realistic, but I've got a show to run, and that means we have to have
scripts ready 4-5 weeks prior to shooting, and the first one was due
the day we GOT this information.

      What was I supposed to do?  Say, "Oh, no, wait around for a few
months, until right before filming, so we'll have plenty of time for
her to come back to us.  We won't have any scripts, of course...."  No.
I needed that gap in the command structure filled from the very first
episode.  So now what do I do?  Bring in a character for 2 episodes,
then turn the show upside down AGAIN and get rid of Tracy?  Because we
don't make this show for a hell of a lot of money; every dime goes to
the show.  If we brought back Ivanova for 8, we'd have to fire Tracy.

      No...it's real simple, Sue.  Whatever was in her head at the
time, the reality is that she walked off the show.  She made a
deliberate, conscious decision to go.  My obligation is to the 10 other
members of our cast, the 200 people in our crew, and the 5 million
viewers to move on and make the best show I can.  There were no
misunderstandings here.  It was a business decision on her part.

      Now can we please, finally, drop this, so I can put in the time
I'm spending arguing here back into making the show?  Or do you still
want to doubt the veracity of me, my crew, John Copeland, and others
just so you can give Claudia the benefit of the doubt?

                                                                  jms

      The problem, as I heard it, was that the stores simply wouldn't
put them out.  They'd sit in the back room because the owner didn't
know what B5 was, and didn't want to take up the shelf space.  The nets
are full of tales of people who were told there were no B5 micros, then
after having the back room checked, found 'em...bought 'em...but the
rest never hit the shelves, just sat back there until they could be
sent back.

      Meanwhile, Galoob was being deluged with phone orders for the
things. They ran out fast, then as the store sets started to come back,
were able to fill orders of stuff that had been out of stock before.

      On the other hand...these are the sorts of stories you tell
years later at conventions...like when Mark Hammil sat for 3 hours at a
comics convention and nobody talked to him because no one had yet heard
anything about this "Star Wars" movie....

      The Lochley character has added so much to season 5, I can't
even begin to describe it.  Everyone who's seen her, has responded very
well, and likes the character enormously.  Where Ivanova's character
was sometimes a hammer to the head, Lochley is a stiletto blade between
the eyes.

      Actually, this is the one area (since you brought it up) where
we tend to shine.  Our scripts are finalized usually 4 in advance of
shooting, so the director has about a month to plan out his or her
episode.  We've found this makes all the difference in the world on
budget, and the whole look of the show.  The only changes that
generally get made are in set locations, to make things easier for the
art department.  But beyond that, there aren't massive changes (often
any changes) to dialogue, story, character, any of that; we rarely get
past 2 drafts, and again, those are mainly for production reasons.

      We've kind of fallen a bit behind this season, due to my back
and other problems, but we're catching up again.

"I think B5 has had a similar effect on science fiction. And the

      This has been our clarion call for the last 4-5 years.  I have
felt strongly from the beginning that the more SF on television, the
more there is competition, the less shows can rest on their laurels. 
Everybody will have to work hard to produce the best show possible when
there is competition, and the ultimate beneficiary of that is the
viewer.

      I will confess that there are momets when I'll be looking at an
outside script with multiple names on it, and think, "It took TWO of
you to write this?"

      I think the reliance on big writing staffs is an error.  It
leads to the frequent creation of little "pocket universes" where each
staffer has kind of his vision or version of the show, and because it's
political at that level, nobody wants to step on anybody else's
toes...and you get a very uneven show, where everyone's also pulling at
everybody else's script, and delays result.

      The best shows of the past tended to have one writer/producer or
one story editor at the core of it, not big writing teams.

                                                                  jms

      Interesting timing on that question...one thing I'm getting into

      RE: the guides...in the informational CD rom, you arrive by
shuttle at the station, and at customs you can choose from three
different guides: the official station tour guide (rather stuffy,
formal, only encourages you to go to the nice places), a rather shady
character who knows all the best (worst) places, and a Gaim.  The
commentaries on the places you go vary from guide to guide.

{original post unavailable}

      And to whom would you send the petition?  And when?  It wasn't
WB's decision that she leave, it was hers.  She was offered the same
deal as the rest of the cast, at the same salary bumps as everyone
else...she wanted more than could be given without a renegoatiation
that would violate our favored nations contracts with everyone
else...so here are your choices, there are no others:

1) You give her the increase (18 episodes for 22 eps pay, in the
contract), and violate the contracts of all your other actors, and
anger them and destroy the sense of fairness you've worked hard to
create over 5 years.

2) You choose to be fair and renegotiate *everyone's* contracts, and
end up without enough money to make the show anymore.

3) You offer the same deal as all the other cast members have, with
the same salary increases guaranteed in their contracts for each
season, and leave it to her to decide whether or not to come back.

We did #3.  She chose to walk away.  So if you're going to send a
petition, you may as well send it to her because it was *her* decision,
not WB, not TNT's, and not mine.

Finally, I'm finishing script #12 right now, we're more than halfway
through the writing season.  Frankly, it's too late for petitions, and
they wouldn't have any effect in any event, because it was never our
choice.  It was hers.

"Well, it is the best written book in the Bible."

      Well...the best *story*, with some of the best writing...but
there's stuff in Proverbs, Psalms, and the Song of Solomon (which
sometimes gets a bit over-written and racy) that can give it a run for
its money.

      There was some good writing back in the old testament...before
it got all showbiz and high-concept....

"...the symmetry and symbolism in how you structured that final
battle.  The story of Babylon 5 basically started with the Minbari
fleet coming to Earth to destroy it at the Battle of the Line.   To
have the Minbari fleet return to Earth, not to destroy humanity, but to
save it, especially along side Earth fighters and capital ships was
stunning."

"...as I am a visual artist, I tend to notice lighting and
structure,etc., especially on the second (or 3rd) viewing, and the
thorny crown was striking to  my eyes, as was the sad,
dark-circles-under-the-eyes, immensely tired look on his face, which
lent to the illusion."

      It's interesting when that happens.  There's a halo around
Sheridan's head at one point when he's yelling at Delenn in the big
room in "Z'ha'dum," and, just as a pointer to something you won't see
for another year....

      When I was directing "Sleeping in Light," there's a scene with
Sheridan and a mirror.  (That's all I'll say about it, so there's no
spoiler info there.)  As John Flinn lit the shot, and angled the
mirror...I froze at what I was seeing on the monitor.  I called John
over, and pointed to it.  "Do you see what I see?"  It took him a
moment, but then his eyes went wide, and by his own reckoning, "the
skin on my arms crawled."  He turned to the guys dressing the set and
said, in a very loud, clear voice, "NOBODY TOUCHES THAT MIRROR!  YOU
HEAR ME!?  NOBODY!"

      It's not a big...but it's a pretty cool unintended illusion
(though once we saw it, we kept it).

poor."

      Well, if you want to go back and listen to what's being said in
the episode, Marcus calls out that the navigational system was damaged,
and they were trying to repair when the big chunk of debris hit them. 
They couldn't get out of the way for that reason.

      Exactly.  As for Marcus, that's precisely the point.  If we do
what we do to Ivanova, then let her get bailed out, then do the same
for Marcus, it becomes a double-cheat, and that's not fair to do to the
audience.  If you bail her out but only at great cost to someone else,
it's not a cheat on either level.

      And yeah, generally, if you follow the threads, you can pick up
on where things are going.  It's something I learned on Murder, She
Wrote, where at the end, when the killer's been revealed, you should be
able to back up the tape, watch it again, and this time see all the
little bits that point to his (or her) identity.  It's basically about
playing fair with the audience.

      Exactly..it doesn't *end* the story, as people kept saying, "Oh,

      Thanks...the only really different thing about the shot is the
length of it; usually our shots average 5-8 seconds; that one was about
15 seconds, so you have more time to get used to what you're seeing,
and absorb it, and make it real.

      Exactly.  Lefcourt does not think that his job is to set policy
or overthrow presidents.  The military executes orders that emanate
from the head of the government, through the chain of command.  Once
that chain of command was changed, the orders were no longer valid.

"If Claudia really wanted to stay, why did she demand more money for

reduced budget (caused by the shift to TNT)?"

      One of the annoying tragedies of this whole thing is that the
above misinformation has gotten coin.  Nobody was asked to, or
accepted, a cutback in salary.  Every cast member got their salary
bumps this year.  The ONLY change in that respect is that series
produced for cable operate on a different residuals structure than
network (big residuals) or syndication (medium residuals)...in cable,
the amount an actor receives over double-scale is applied as an advance
against royalties.  Once that advance is burned through, which in the
case of some actors on B5 happens in just a few runs of the show, the
residuals kick in again.

"I've been thinking about the rapidity of her return to ISN.  I agree
that there wasn't time to break her out of prison and get her old
dressing room back for the morning news"

      When the Soviet Union fell, and the prison doors were thrown
open, a number of reporters who had fallen out of favor with the Party
and were sitting in cells walked out, went across the street, and went
on the air within a matter of hours.

      Yes, EST = GMT.

      And this episode wasn't rushed; it's what you do when you're
bringing any story to its climax.  It's like watching Aliens, going
away before the last 20 minutes, coming back and saying, "Well, it
moved awfully fast."  It has to, you're in the big moment.  No, there
isn't time for everything, there is NEVER time for everything, there's
always stuff we might want to see...but what's in Endgame is what was
always going to be in Endgame.  If I'd known there would be a 5th
season at the time, I still would've written it exactly the way it was
written.

      The collapsing was done for the most part *long* before we ever
got to this part of the season.

      It's just fast because that's what you need to do at this point.

      No, that's a new shot (Claudia at the window).  She was shot for
that episode for that voice-over...we just changed one line.  The basic
thrust was that she was going to take some time to *decide* whether to
take on B5, or to take on a Warlock class destroyer.  So we just went
with the decision.

"That's where I'm hopeful...that we can let the studios know our hopes
to see her in any future movies or Crusade.  Encourage other fans to

      Two things:

      1) It wasn't the studio's choice in the first place, it's not
like they wanted her gone...she left, so there's not much point in
writing them.

      2) It's not their call in many ways on future projects in ANY
event; they basically let me write whatever I want, so it's my call.

      What the fans need to know...is that by constantly bugging me
about this and haranging me and hassling me about it...they are not
leaving me well disposed toward that prospect.  I have a tendency, when
pushed and generally honked off, to go in the exact opposite direction
of where I'm being pushed.

      Yeah, it's probably stupid and immature, and I should deal with
such hassling better...but I'm human, rumors to the contrary...and in
that respect, writers are like violins...finely tuned and highly
strung.  Don't mess with the strings.

      One thing we've noted is that there's been some minor

still a hostile climate, but not as bad as it is right now.

suggested the different ratio of inertial mass to weight by having
character's feet skid out from under them when stopping, bouncing off
walls while turning corners, overbalancing on turns, or catching things
they had dropped two seconds after dropping them.  Maybe tossing a CGI
grenade."

      Except, of course, this would've looked awfully silly on camera.

      BTW, remember that Number One and Garibaldi, as well as Lyta,
have experience with living on Mars, so they would automatically
compensate.

"Well, unless its a coincidence, the "circled doodled message left by
madman after he commits suicide" is VERY similar to what happens in Dr.
Strangelove. Again, maybe its JMS's homage to Kubrick (like the "2001"
style spacesuit that appeared in a second or third season episode, I
forget which, of B5)."

      Just to clarify this....

      Re: the note...the script as written calls only for the finding
of a note with the words "scorched earth" on it.  It was John
Copeland's idea to do the note as shown, and yes, he's said quite
openly over on AOL that it was his nod to Strangelove.  (John directed
that episode.)

      Re: the suit...that wasn't an intentional 2001 nod...we went to
Modern Props to get a space suit for Babylon Squared, and the only one
they had on hand that would work for us was one left-over from 2010,
which I asked the folks in costume to change as much as
possible...though it was pretty much what it was regardless.  So that
one wasn't intentional.

      The Rangers are independent in authority, answering only to
Delenn and Sheridan and the members of the Alliance council and
advisory board.  (In roughly descending order.)  But their jurisdiction
is exclusively in interplanetary situations between various member
races.  Each member race has the sovereign authority to govern its
people in its own way.

      The closest comparison is that overall, the states are free to
enact their own laws, but the US Government has sole claim over
international matters.  Except here the states would have far more
autonomy than is currently the rule; more like pre-Civil War America.

                                                                  jms

moments on the cutting room floor.  We lost 14 minutes of good stuff,
which is now going to go back and we're going to tighten and make it
better, the way we do our cuts on all the episodes.

"Should you get the go-ahead (under acceptable terms to you) to do a
B5 feature film, would you be able to do it at the current Babylonian
facilities, or would the scope of such a project force you to
relocate?"

      We'd do a lot of the indoors stuff here, to take advantage of
standing sets for some of it, but for other parts we'd have to go on
location and other stuff.

"And, as a corollary, would you be able to apply the "Babylonian
model" of efficient production to a feature film, or does it best serve
the interlocking demands of a TV series?"

      Yes, but in different ways.  For instance, the CGI is not
rendered at a level greater than can be handled by TV screens
(including HDTV) because it's a waste, you'll never see the
difference...but for a feature you'd have to render at a higher
resolution.  So there's a lot that would apply, and some that wouldn't.

                                                                  jms

      Thanks...a hideous amount of rendering power and time went into
that episode, and the result is all there on-screen.  The only bigger
CGI feast is in the prequel, which is approximately 21% EFX, most of it
pure CGI and composites.

      The story never ends.  It's this part of the telling that will
end.

places, and new music.

      Thanks....

      I think a lot of the nitpicking comes out of people feeling they
*have* to express an opinion about something.  It's something you learn
as a writer; if somebody goes into a bookstore and buys a book, they
bring it home, read it, and if they like it, they like it; if they
don't, they don't, and that's really kind of it, just the broad
strokes.  If you write a book and give it to a friend, the friend will
feel s/he has to go through it and give you critical responses..."I
just didn't buy it when John bought the vanila ice cream cone on page
47, a guy like that would buy chocolate."

      Once the creation of the show is over, I think that it'll fall
back into the general reaction category.

      The interesting thing about revisionism is, as you say, that so
much of it goes on already.  John Copeland over lunch the other day was
outraged over a situation where new Japanese textbooks are being
introduced indicating that the rape of Nanking never happened, and that
the bombing of Pearl Harbor was in retaliation for Hiroshima.

      I'm constantly amazed....

      Good comments.  One note:

"The credits were interesting.  Claudia Christian has been almost
completely excised from them, which, considering that Jason Carter
still has a credit, seems kinda petty."

      WB called us after we'd done the credits for that episode, about
5 days before the uplink, after realizing that if her credits were in
that episode, AND in "Sleeping in Light" which appears in S5, that it
could very possibly trigger another salary payment, which is
substantial.  So we could credit her in one or the other, and since she
wasn't in DoFS, it's S5, that was the one to take out.  Since Jason
wasn't in "Sleeping," it was okay to leave him in.

      It was a WB mandate from business affairs, nothing more.

                                                                  jms

"it came down to contractual language vs personal assurances (thats as

were more concerned with the former, and jms thought the latter should
be adequate"

      It was also contractual language on other sides, since giving
what was asked for would've violated our contracts with every other
member of our cast, and we couldn't do that.
