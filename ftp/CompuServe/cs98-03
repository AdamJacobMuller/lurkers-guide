      Trivia...actually, the original Latin phrase (if I have this
right from memory) is "exceptio probat regulum," a colloquialism which
actually means "the exception puts the rulte to the test of proof." 
It's the bastardized interpretation which comes out to "exception
proves rule."

      No, the episode is the episode; the only reason I could get in
15 minutes back in the pilot was because I could find 15 minutes to cut
*out* to make room for it easily, and still maintain the same basic
running time.  SiL is as tight as it's ever gonna get.

      Yes, Neil's episode is up next...and as for the Xon, the
difference is that the Centauri main-line clashed with the Xon when
both were primitive and fighting for food, resources, that sort of
thing, similar to our Neanderthal - Cro Magnon struggle, whereas the
Hyach did it when they were more advanced, and it wasn't a struggle,
more of a program of extermination.

      We felt it wise to adjust the airing order so we could ramp up
the following episodes prior to the NBA delay without having any
interruption in the tone of the episodes (i.e., 2 tense, 1 funny, 2
tense vs 1 funny and 4 tense in a row).

Subject: The Progress of Year 5

{original post had no questions}

      Thanks...I agree with pretty much everything in your note.  The
thing about this show, one of many, is that I do tend to look at each
season as a separate volume in the story, and I try to give each season
a unique and distinct flavor...from the main titles (the book's "cover)
to the stories, and the *way* those stories are told.  The first few
episodes are always the transition point, the plateau, where the
changes are worked out.

      The other thing is that in the past, I've generally said "this
is part of the arc" by doing a lot of finger-pointing, flag-waving and
jumping up and down.  I figured that after 4 years of seeing that the
first third of the season is generally setup for the consequences that
will follow, that I wouldn't have to do so much "fireworks-pay-
attention" to this stuff...but I may have been wrong in that respect. 
No, I haven't *said* "this is meaningful" even though it is, and will
be more obviously so in hindsight, because I figured by this time in
the game everybody knew the routine and I wouldn't have to red-flag it
in advance.

      I was talking about this to some of the folks on the show, and
they had the same reaction, offering: this is a history, and sometimes
when a major event takes place, nobody knows it's happened yet.  On the
day the stocks began to fall, could someone have stood up and said,
"And from this came the great depression?"  When Archduke Ferdinand was
killed, could someone have said, that day, "And from this comes World
War One and World War Two and the Cold War."  You only see the pattern
in hindsight.

      What's being laid out in the first part of this season are the
threads that will become increasingly important, and fundamentally
change the lives of everybody in the show...but because it's not being
flagged as such, some people tend to dismiss it as filler.

      As one person noted to me today in email, it's as if someone
wrote to Tolkein and said, "Listen, the book is okay, but on page 248
why the hell did you spend so much time on hobbits when the story is
about Aragorn?  What the hell is it with you and hobbits?  I'm not
saying that I'm going to stop reading the book, but unless you get back
to Strider fast the story is going to suck and wander."

      Bottom line...I'm doing now exactly what I have done with the
show from day one: I'm writing this to please myself, to tell the story
that *I* want to see.  If others want to see that, great; if others
don't, that's fine too, because the exercise is getting the story told
the way I want it told.  And that I have done.  And in the long run,
that's what's pulled people to this show: it's a singular vision, a one-
man story, told the way one person wants it to be told, as in any novel
off the shelf.

      I just hope, when all the shouting and hand-wringing is done,
and the season is over, and all the threads of the story lead right
back through to the beginning of this season, showing the filler to be
nothing of the sort, that these same folks will come out and say they
were wrong, as those who said at the time that there was no arc in
season 1 have done since the show has gone into reruns and the arc has
become totally evident.

      I can hope that because I specialize in writing fantasy, you
know....

                                                                  jms

Subject: Dramatic Structure

{original post had no questions}

      Thanks...the denouement or falling action is where you get to
show the consequences, that's often where a lot of the more interesting
things happen. Otherwise, it's just "okay, it's over" and that's it. 
I'm a big subscriber to the notion of proper dramatic structure, and I
try to hew to it on a large scale with the overall arc, and each
individual episode.  You can track every episode, and every season,
from the progression of introduction, rising action, complication,
climax and denouement.  I figure it's a solid literary framework that
has worked for several thousand years, it's *got* to be good enough for
TeeVee....

      We were impressed by his portrayal of Minbari, and that led to
him coming in for Byron.

      No, the ratings are added for the two showings in a week.

      As for the ratings...we are TNT's second-highest rated show. 
Where does it say we have to be in the top 15 of everything on cable or
it's not a success?  Voyager's and DS9's ratings would put it at the
bottom of the network pile, but it's closer to the high-middles in
syndication.  The only ratings figure that matters is this: have the
ratings been high enough for the show to stay on the air, and let me
tell the story that I wanted to tell?  And the answer to that is yes. 
And now the show is out there; nobody cares 10 years from now if it was
in the top 15, or 5, or 50...the show is the show is the show.

      And those who come in from the Trek camp to badmouth B5 because
of the ratings should be reminded that the original Star Trek was
canceled in its third year because of poor ratings...and was considered
a failure by the networks and the studio.  But the show was the show
was the show, and now it has grown.

      As will B5.

                                                                  jms

      Much the opposite; for a fanatical portion of them, this is a

      B5 has *killer* demographics, substantially better than Lois and
Clark, which did very good demos.

      But see, this is the trap...you let the other guy define the
argument for you, and the second they do that, they win the argument. 
"Unless B5 does as good as ST, then it ain't worth squat."  Well,
you're comparing a 5 year show against a 30 year franchise...apples and
oranges.  Now, if you want to compare B5 in its 5 years against the
original ST...then B5 wins, because we're on two years after they were
CANCELED.

      The fight is a dopey one on the face of it...caused by people
who want a fight between the shows, and want to define the argument
such that it makes everybody feel they have to defend something that
does not require *any* defense.

                                                                  jms

"Have you ever studied Gurdjieff or Sufism, or any of the Eastern

      I think studied is too formal a word...I've read just about

      It varies, I get involved to different degrees with different
writers; with Neil, it was more "What do you want to write?"  He
noodled around with some ideas, ran one past me that he liked, and I
liked it...he asked for a truckload of scripts for reference, picked
the characters he wanted to use, researched them, we talked on the
phone and via email a number of times as he refined his ideas further,
then wrote the script.  I tucked and nipped a little here and there,
but pretty much left it alone.

                                                                  jms

{original post had no questions}

      Neil kept the humor sort of off-base...operating on the
assumption that there are some things that become au courant or funny
because of context: Steve Martin's "excuuuuse me," for instance.  Now,
it ain't funny, it's just annoying...at the time, EVERYbody was saying
it and laughing.  R&Z are similar cultural phenomena...their "with a
machine" catchphrase, for instance, which the crowd new and reacted to.
To us, and Lochely, it didn't mean anything. Lochley's reaction was
tailored to be EXACTLY the same as most women's (and some guy's)
reaction to the Three Stooges: either it's funny, or you can't figure
out why people are laughing.

                                                                  jms

      This is not quite correct, but that's all I can say for now. 
There are one or two actors who might slide to Crusade, depending on
circumstances, and we have spoken to them on the QT about it...which is
probably why this was said, because I asked the actors in question not
to say anything until we got closer to seeing how things were going to
work out; the inquiries were mainly of an "if we had this role, would
you be interested in doing it?" nature, checking avails and
possibilities so we could plan accordingly.

      Neil wrote for R&Z, and we looked around for casting...it
occured to someone -- may have been me, maybe casting, I don't remember
 -- that it might be better to use a real comedy team than create one. 
B5 called P&T, and they said yes.

"How do you feel now that the 5 year arc is completed?"

      Exhausted, but relieved; we made it to the end.  We did what we
said we were going to do, and nobody and nothing can take that away
from us.

"How was the feeling on the set today while filming "Wheel of Fire"
compared to "Sleeping in Light"?"

      The last ep filmed today is "Objects at Rest."  The attitude was
a bit different than SiL, because there was some hope of a fifth season
that took some of the edge off SiL...but here it's clear: I said this
was a 5 year series, and it ends at five years, so everyone knew this
was it, at least for the series.  There were a lot of tears, hugging,
some speeches...it was hard.

"What do you plan to do now that the series has been completed?"

      Make the next TV movies, and get going on the next project.

each soldier sees his or her part of it, and at the end, we call it the
battle of X.  That sense of out-of-control events.  It was something I
wanted very much to get right.

      You never know exactly how long it's going to be on film; you
ballpark the page count, and sometimes you come in a bit long,
sometimes you come in a bit short.  We're usually pretty close to time,
and only have to do small line cuts.  Easier to trim than to add after
the fact.

Subject: B5 after TNT?

{original post had no questions}

      Interestingly, one of the requirements of the shows that began
under PTEN is that they must show a profit *the very first year*,
rather than having to wait for the long run...so B5 has been turning a
profit for WB since the first day.

      Not that my statement reflects this, natch, and never will,
because then they'd have to actually *pay* me some of those profits....

                                                                  jms

      Exactly.  What a number of people tend to overlook is that if
you look at the structure of the show, the bigger the zetz that you're
about to get, the more I allow you a bit of breathing time in between
zetzes.  So it's a safe bet that the longer the breathing time, the
bigger the ball bat....

      We did deal with the B4 issue in a later episode, War Without
End.

Subject: TNT ALERT S5 Schedule

{original post had no questions}

      You're correct; a number of folks have told TNT that they're
waiting until seeing all the S1-4 episodes before watching season 5, so
they're timing the new cycle of S5 eps, starting from the beginning, so
these folks can catch up after the end of the S1-4 episodes.

      One part or another of that may be accurate; one part or another

      He was never married, she came to B5 for a pre-marriage visit,
but remember that it got postponed indefinitely.

      SAG rules specify where credits go; it's sometimes a bummer if
you're trying to keep something secret, but there you go.

      The Na'Toth thing was something I wanted to do, called Caitlin,
she was up for it, and I wrote the ep.

      I have zip influence on when anyone screens B5...it's not in my
jurisdiction.
