      Yes, we both have equal ownership of Babylonian Productions, but
Netter Digital Entertainment is his separate company, I have nothing to
do with it, don't work for or with it or own any of it.

"I decided to not address that part of your message because it seemed
moot in light of the fact that I agreed with you in regard to the
Carlin 7, that we are reconsidering our position that we will abide by
them, and that, in the meantime, would discontinue "backrooming" any
messages unless they were blatantly offensive and/or broke other forum
rules.  As for the stats you requested, I can't provide what I do not
have.  While I admit that we pulled messages containing profanity, we
did not do so "arbitrarily."  We pulled EVERY message that we saw."

      Ah, but now that confirms what I suggested earlier.  The rules
require you to pull one such message per every 50 messages, that was
the part of the rule book that you, yourself, cited to me.  So if you
pulled EVERY message, then you violated CIS rules.  So that point is
now resolved.  Thank you.

"If we decide to no longer aspire to remaining off the PC list then
Carlin's 7 becomes moot and you will have "won" on both of your points.
What more do you want?"

      Actually, nothing...and this isn't about me winning, I don't
have any vested interest in you losing or me winning.  Who wins if a
situation goes from unreasonable to reasonable?  Answer: we both win. 
You aren't stuck having to enforce essentially indefensible and
arbitrary policies, and can instead enforce them selectively,
logically, and in keeping with CIS policies. Which means you don't get
people yelling at you, and you have the backing to avoid doing things
which you, yourself, stated you don't like doing.  I don't see this as
a particularly bad thing at all here.

RE: the interview this afternoon with Sci-Fi Entertainment, in which I
mentioned the current fracas, you say:

"Thank you for indicting us in an area where we can't "confront our
accuser."
 Old Joe McCarthy would be proud of you for using that tactic.  I hope
that you will "update her" if you and I conclude this discussion to
your satisfaction."

      I simply applied the same practice that was going on here, and
backroomed the discussion with the reporter, since that seemed good
enough for the sysops.  And you can certainly "confront your accuser"
 -- assuming that anyone who speaks from their own experience of a
controversial situation is automatically your accuser -- when the piece
appears.  But to your last point...yes, I will indeed update her
completely if this continues toward a positive resolution, as it seems
to be doing.   Understand that I'm a pain in the butt...but I'm fair. 
And I try to be honest.

      That said...I now turn to the earlier, positive comments, so we
can end this on a positive note...and those looking on: pay attention
to what's said in Wes's note.

      Regarding the rules under discussion, note the following:

      "...we are reconsidering our position that we will abide by
them, and that, in the meantime, would discontinue "backrooming" any
messages unless they were blatantly offensive and/or broke other forum
rules."

      I think that this single sentence now takes care of most of the
concerns here; if the practice of backrooming is now being
discontinued, this is a positive step in the right direction, and
negates about 75% of the concern shared by myself and others here.  I
think that most people here would agree with that.

      "If we decide to no longer aspire to remaining off the PC list
then Carlin's 7 becomes moot."  A valid point.

      Re: the Fair Use issue: "That isn't as definitive as I'd like,
but seems to substantiate what other, non-legal, folks have said.  On
the other hand, there have been others who are or have been publicists
who claim that more than 2-3 lines quoted exceed "fair use."  Believe
me, we're working on nailing this down."

      Thank you, and I have every confidence that what you discover
will confirm what has been discussed here.  Bear in mind that
publicists are rarely journalists, and their job is often to discourage
use of their client's material in excess, so they can control it, and
when using one's quotes to publicize something, there are other very
strict rules that come into play. If I write a review of a book, and a
publicist wants to excerpt that review to promote someone's book to
make them money, I'm going to be fairly hard about what's allowed to
promote someone else's work.

      This is a different situation altogether from quoting material
in the context of a discussion.  There the Fair Use contingencies of
copyright law come into play.  Any good book on journalism law will go
into this at length. Good on you, though, to continue to dig into it.

      "Any constructive suggestions you have would be welcomed --
assuming we decide to continue with wanting to stay off the PC list. 
Hell, for that matter, any constructive suggestions ANYONE has would be
welcomed at this point!"

      Which was the other point I mentioned.  By not backrooming these
sorts of discussions, you open up the door to constructive suggestions
on how to deal with them.  If you had said, "Listen, folks, we have a
problem here...the use of language is getting into the
more-than-1-in-50 limits we have to abide by, and I'm concerned about
the quoting of material.  Could you work with me on this and come up
with some ways to moderate the discussion a bit so it doesn't get out
of hand, and give me some hard facts about what constitutes Fair Use"
I'll bet you $100 you'd have tons of *constructive* comments, NObody 
would've said you had a german accent, and you would've come out of
this like a saint.

      B5 fans are *notoriously* helpful, and understanding, and you
can bet your shoes they would've come at you with a very different
response.  "Here," they would've said, "HERE is somebody who respects
our intelligence, who wants our input, who is open to at least
*discuss* this so that we know what's at stake, and know what our
options are, and would welcome our help to resolve a thorny problem
he's stuck with and doesn't much like."

      So given all this...to those looking on...lay back for a bit.  I
think we are getting some positive movement here, the policy of
backrooming has already been stopped, from what Wes has said, and the
policy is being reconsidered, which was the point of the exercise.

      I think that Wes has been very receptive here, and has made a
good faith effort to rectify what is, for him and other sysops here, a
difficult and obviously painful situation.  Let's now let the process
continue.

      The "Joe McCarthy" comment I will let slide personally, because
you were upset, and we're all entitled to a moment's upset.  Instead, I
will again simply thank you for taking the steps you have taken, and
look forward to the final resolution of this.

                                                                  jms

{original post had no questions}

      Thanks.  I've seen just about every article on CTS that I can
think of, and I've got it down to a roar...sometimes it's worse than
other times.  The Kinesis ergonomic keyboard at work helps, and I just
sent out for a Datahand keyboard to use at home to see if that helps
further.  It aches pretty much all the time, but it's a low, dull ache
and I'm hardly aware of it most of the time.  It's only when I go to
bed, and I'm still for more than 5 minutes at a time, that it really
starts to demand my attention.

      It was *much* worse last year or so, when I had to literally
write for 20 minutes, ice down my hands/wrists for 20 minutes, write
for 20, ice for 20, on and on.  I actually haven't had to do that this
year.

      (And yes, when I remember to do so, I use the wrist braces.)

                                                                  jms

      Give Wes some time...he has restored the messages, and is
currently in the position of reconsidering the situation regarding the
rules themselves, and what actually applies within those rules.  I
think we should be willing to give him the room to do so without an
immediate deadline, since he has made a good faith effort here.

"The ultimate irony is that *you,* our resident atheist, promised to
regale us with a plethora of censorable biblical quotations!"

      Who better?

      Y'gotta understand, I've read the thing *twice*, cover to cover.
(And ANYone with the patience to get through Deuteronomy, Numbers and
Leviticus has my enduring respect.)  It's actually a pretty good book,
all things considered, and despite some misuse by some of its readers. 
There's good drama, lots of melodrama, an overall arc (and an ark),
some good writing and some utterly *awful* writing, blood and thunder
and some racy material, the perfect ingredients for a
potboiler...except that it's often redeemed by such terrific parts as
Psalms, and parts of the Song of Solomon, and Proverbs, and the story
of Job, which is probably one of the best stories ever written.

      A good editor would've helped *enormously*, but one can't expect
god to be all things at once....

      As it happens, I have an answer to this.  First, it's Warner
Bros. that would be at issue here, since they own the copyright to B5. 
That issue aside for the moment...

      This actually came up not long ago, when a person doing synopses
of the episodes didn't just synopsize it...it included every line of
dialogue in the episode, and extensive narrative descriptions.  WB saw
that and said, "Tell 'em to stop it."  Which they did.

      On several occasions, whole pages at a time have been excerpted
for articles, or reprinted...a heck of a lot more than what was posted
here...and neither WB nor I have a problem with that.  As it is, many
of the current synopses contain *massive* verbatim quotes of dialogue,
just not as much as the one main offender.  Nobody blinks an eye.

      I'm not saying this across the board, but you asked what would
apply in my situation, and that's it.  (Which, btw, is a kind of
evasion...rather than dealing with the problem That Is, people create
what they hope are similar situations and say, "Well, what would you do
if THIS happened?"  Well, this HASN'T happened, and it isn't a direct
corrolary to this current situation in ANY event.  Its' just a way of
skidding the discussion off in another direction and muddying the
waters.)

                                                                  jms

      Yeah, the human DNA definitely helped...and overall, this isn't
so much the arc as the overall story and history.  It's filling out the
world.

      There's the One, and the Nine...when Dukhat was alive, there
were 9 grey council members and him as the head of it, making ten. 
(Look at the picture and count the number of people.)  1 and 9.

      Valen called together the Grey Council, formed the first one;
until then the castes had been in constant competition.  He wanted to
operate outside of that a bit, so he made sure he was not one of the
Nine.  That tradition has continued.

"But that doesn't mean I'll back every decision or idea or crusade or
action he takes - and nobody SHOULD (and I bet he'd be the first to
agree with me)."

      Yup.  When I behave like a jerk here, I fully expect to be told
so.

"The issue he's brought up here is a valid one - but the method he
started with was too confrontational by far. He should have started it
friendly, specially without the threats of splitting, and then, if
rebuffed, gotten brittle."

      That one, I dunno...it's easy to second-guess things after the
fact.  I knew that a number of people had *already* either been (or
felt) forced off, or were resigning, and sometimes the only way to get
a result is to first get the horse's attention, as the saying goes. 
I've had a number of dealings with lots of systems and worked things
out quietly, behind the scenes; you don't know about them *because*
they've been worked out in a friendly way.

      Then, there are days when only a howitzer will suffice.

      It was my call.  I made it.  And it seems to have worked.  Would
it have worked out with the other approach?  Again, I dunno.  I'm only
a P3, after all....

                                                                  jms

      Related question, Wes:  When a conference is promoted at the
opening menu, does it bring in a substantial number of folks who are
not *already* members of the forum?  I was just thinking that folks not
into SF likely would not show up for a conference with an SF type...and
those into SF are likely already aware of it from the on-site notice. 
Just curious.

      I see.  Though, that would apply only to SFMEDONE, if it got the
PC label...you could still hold COs on SFMEDTWO, with different forums.
In other words...let's say, worst case scenario, SF1 gets PC'd.  No
opening menu announcements.  But SF2 is *not* PC'd.  So the CO could be
held there; and since they're both (presumably) under the same roof, it
all works out the same, yes?

      Email...maybe 60-80 per day, sometimes more.  In public forum
messages, on various systems...hundreds.

      I try to answer as much as I can, but often the questions are
too complex, or ask for elaborate story discussion ("Can you give me
the history of Minbar before Earth made contact?"), or have
multiple-subquestions to the point where I can't deal with ANY of it.

      See, the problem is, everyone thinks "Well, it's just me, after
all." Well, according to our ratings, there are between 10-15 million
"me's" out there.  But often folks don't understand that.

      For instance, a guy sent me a piece of email recently with 13
*very* elaborate and detailed questions, much along the lines of the
one just quoted above.  I couldn't get into any of them, there were
just too many, and they were much too involved.  A week later, I got a
VERY angry and agitated letter from that person saying what a jerk I
was for not answering his questions, that he had taken the time to
write them so I had an obligation to answer them, he's the Fan who is
keeping the show alive and we owe this to the fans who support us...he
got fairly abusive about it.  "It shouldn't take too much of the BUSY
PRODUCER'S TIME to answer ONE LETTER!" he said in conclusion.

      Sure, if it WERE just one letter.  But it ain't.

      Other times, people will leave public or private mail
*demanding* I answer something, as though I were under contract to
them, or paid to be here. Suffice to say that I generally ignore such
notes.

      It's worth noting, though, that those remain the exceptions to
the rule; most of the online crowd is well-behaved and intelligent and
courtous, especially among B5 fans.

                                                                  jms

      Never said there shouldn't be guidelines.  The only question was
the extent, the degree, and the clarity or consistency with which those
rules are applied.  The general concensus was that the rule was being
*over*applied. So now let's see how it shakes down before taking the
next logical step.

      Y'know, I've been thinking about all this a lot over the last
few days (what else do I have to do, run a show or something?) and
here's the thing that gets me in the area of parental controls.

      It starts with discussions over language, and nobody wants to
say "We can't have language or other problematic items our
conferences," because it smacks of censorship (which, in fact, it is). 
(And, granted, some uses of language are a little more disagreeable
than others, I'm not getting into degrees here, just the overall
notion.)

      So someone says, "Instead of doing that, let's have a Ratings
System, which will tell parents which forums (or shows) are safe for
their kids, and which are not, so we can have areas where you can say
whatever you want, and other areas where it's more controlled, and
parents know where to go."

      Then the ratings go into place...but nobody wants to be tagged
with the harsher designation.  Because that would mean a loss of
revenue, or prestige, or visibility.  So now everyone starts doing
whatever it takes to avoid that rating, by changing content or
enforcing stricter rules to avoid the label, since that's somewhat
easier to defend (even though it's exactly the same as the original
problem, they've just moved the target to something that's less of an
obvious flash-point as censorship).

      What you therefore end up with is that all forums or shows move
toward the safer designation, and there no longer IS a choice between
"kid" and "adult" conversations or topics or language or subjects. 
Because the latter has ceased to exist not for political reasons but
for *economic* ones.

      It's much like what happened in the record biz...some groups
wanted labels put on records, have them rated so parents and kids could
tell the hard stuff from the safe stuff, "But we're not pro-censorship,
we just want to be informed."  Until the records started coming out, at
which point the same parents groups began screaming about x-rated
albums being even in the same STORE where kids could enter their orbit,
even if protected by cellophane wrapping and warned by labels.  It
became a basis for exclusion.

      Nobody in TV right now wants to be hit with the TV-M (mature)
rating, because of threatened boycotts.  It's the same material that
may have been there before, but now that it has a label, that label has
become a target.

      The expressed intent is to create clarity in making choices in
material.

      The result is to *remove* choices by excluding material.

      The more I look at it, the more insidious it gets.

      I think I'll write something about this, one of these days....

                                                                  jms

       Yes, Mir is her family; you are generally born into a caste
unless you at some point decide that the calling of your heart is
elsewhere, at which point you enter training for that other caste (with
the permission of your caste leaders) until such time as it's finalized
that that's what you want, at which time you're assigned to a clan
within that caste.  If you choose to stay in the caste you're born
into, you automatically are in your familiy's clan.

       No, the fault was mine, not the suits.

       Prior to exec producing B5, I had never edited a show before,
never had final cut before...had never even been IN an editing room for
more than 5 minutes before.  So here I am, given the director's
cut...and I know it's real slow, but I haven't done this before, so I
don't trust my instincts.  I let it go with very minimal changes.

       And I've been kicking myself ever since.  I should've followed
my instincts, but instead I deferred to the director's cut.

       It's a mistake I have never made since.

       Even so, that first cut just gnaws at me...I *know* I can make
it better, stronger, even if only a bit in a few places, that would
help salve my soul over this thing.

       No, if you keep watching Dukhat comes in, followed by Delenn,
through the opening (the empty spot) and then another Minbari comes in
to fill that spot.

       Those were Soul Hunters, who in the first season we learned
showed up to attempt to grab Dukhat's soul...they were prevented from
successfully boarding the ship by the Minbari, who threw up a wall of
bodies to stop them (which is why there were few around with Delenn and
Dukhat; Soul Hunters are a pretty advanced sort, the terror of Minbari,
and it took a lot to stop them). After Dukhat died, Delenn went down
and joined in, confronting them about this.

Subj:Confessions of a CIS sysop
Date:97-03-03 23:00:21 EST
From:rick@hugin.imat.com (Rick Moen)
To:jmsatb5@aol.com

Here's how CIS forum-content regulation works, from the perspective of
a (former) CIS primary forum sysop ("wizop").

I used to work for a software company, and as part of my job as a
support rep created a CIS forum to support our customers -- and then
ran it single-handed for four years.  This meant answering all
CIS-based customer questions from around the world, plus handling all
forum administration.  Many wizops recruit assistants, giving them
access to some sysop functions.

As a forum (primary) sysop, one is handed a couple of big binders,
that mostly cover technical matters, but in passing touch on content
guidelines.  These were vaguely described, but the sysop is told he's
obliged to keep "off" all profanity, solicitations of business for
other online services, and some other things.  Forum members were to be
_advised_ by e-mail if a post had been removed, and could be locked out
(in ordinary circumstances) _only_ after a warning. (As a courtesy, I
also sent a copy of any removed post back via e-mail, in case the
poster wanted to edit and re-post it or send it unchanged via e-mail.)

I enforced the profanity guidelines, among others, permissively, and
always with the advisories described.  I told members up front that it
was a _support_ forum, and that they could create a Berate Company
Management forum elsewhere.

To get to the point, several things:  (1) "Wizops" operate forums by
contract with CIS for a percentage of user billings.  (2) CIS thus
distances itself from both administration _and_ some legal liability. 
(They can say "Not our fault.  We weren't running it." This, in my
view, is CIS sysops' primary design function.)

(3) The standard CIS forum contract forbids disclosure of its terms to
any third party.   (Yes, I'm violating it.  I have reason.)

(4) Many if not most forum sysops, both wizops and their chosen
assistants, ignore the obligation of accountability to users. They do
this for convenience's sake, and because there's little to hold them
accountable.  My successor did this, for example. Sysops tend to see
themselves as overworked and under-appreciated (almost always true): 
Unfortunately, they tend to consider this an excuse for whatever
management techniques seem most expedient.

(5) CIS forum management routinely abdicates its responsibility to
oversee sysops.  My guess is that exercising it would (most of the
time) tend to increase their legal exposure, and they intercede only if
there's a disaster brewing that might spill over from the sysop onto
them.  I've known a number of cases of people appealing to CIS
management over clear cases of high-handed sysop behaviour:  I don't
think CIS even _responded_ to any of those users. Again, little existed
to _hold_ them accountable.

(6) The remedy:  Exactly what you're doing.  Have someone watch the
watchers, and spotlight abuse when it happens.  Don't accept
convenience and mishap as excuses for absurd happenings such as those
you've described.  The responsible parties _will_ be motivated to
elmininate abuses if faced with fair complaints from multiple parties,
that won't go away if ignored.

Thank you for pursuing the matter.  Feel free to quote this e-mail if
you wish, and you need not omit my name or mailbox, if you do.  I stand
behind it.

      A director's cut can be the same as, or vastly different from,
the producer's cut, depending on what the director does, and how much
in sync the director is with the producer.  But the producer gets final
cut in TV, whereas the director gets final cut in films (unless the
studio or a big name producer has it contractually otherwise).

      That is kinda funny, since I was sent a private message here a

"pain in the ass" in a public forum...and here that word is used in a

*nearly* enough trouble lately.  So I may as well go for broke.

                                                                  jms 

John J. Miller
SFWA Secretary
Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America
(address deleted for privacy)

Dear Mr. Miller:

I am in receipt of your recent letter inviting me to rejoing SFWA.
While others who have either resigned from SFWA or let their
memberships lapse have received similar letters, I note that you
added, in handwriting, the following: "Michael - We're particularly
interested in encouraging writers of your stature and experience to
rejoin."

I'm posting this, my reply, both online as well as in standard mail
to you, because the issues at hand affect others in the industry;
because it is a good subject for public debate; and because SFWA has
to this date refused to publish my letter of resignation from SFWA
in its membership publication; even now, years after the fact, SFWA
does not choose to recognize the boorishness of its behavior toward
those of us who work in television, film and other media.

To recap, for the benefit of those looking on, and for the purpose
of historical accuracy: a number of us were troubled by the fact
that SFWA allowed TV and film scripts in the SF genre to count for
membership, so that our dues could be accepted, but that these very
same scripts were not considered "real" science fiction...and thus
ineligible for consideration for a Nebula Award.

An attempt was made to restore the Dramatic Nebula, given in years
past, in order to achieve equity with other forms of SF.  Those
involved in the attempt included myself, Harlan Ellison, David
Gerrold, D.C. Fontana, Michael Cassutt and others.  We believed,
foolishly in retrospect, that SF writers -- presumably forward
thinking and progressive -- would understand that stories can take
new and different forms, that SF for television and film was a
perfectly valid form.  It's still SF; it simply uses a new kind of
technology to facilitate that storytelling.  Since SF is often
about the foolishness of small-minded people when faced with
changing technologies, and generally the impact of technology on
people and art forms, we felt they would agree that the time
was right for the reinstatement of the Dramatic Nebula.

We were wrong.

We were greeted by an outpouring of such virulent bigotry, such
undisguised hostility, and such abuse as to numb the senses.  There
was hate mail, name-calling and dead-catting; we were called (in
person, and in SFWA's publication) "hacks" and "no-talents" and
told that scripts aren't stories...obscene and threatening messages
were left on my answering machine...hate mail arrived at my home...
and the most nakedly straightforward one stated, "I work my ass off
for a few pennies a word, while you Hollywood hacks earn big bucks
for turning out crap.  You'll never see the Dramatic Nebula back as
long as I'm alive."

To help defuse some of the tempers, many of us were willing to
disqualify ourselves from ever being eligible for the Nebula, should
it be reinstated, to remove any suspicion of a vested interest.  It
was the principle that concerned us.

For an organization claiming forward-thinkers, there was more fuzzy
thinking and illogic pouring out of SFWA than at any average meeting
of the Flat Earth Society.  "Why should SFWA give scriptwriters a
Nebula if the WGA won't give awards to prose writers?" some yelled
at us, which granted was at least an attempt to put together a
comprehensible sentence.

"Because the WGA is *form* oriented, and SFWA is *genre* oriented,"
we said, "that's why.  Any genre script can win a WGA award, as long
as it's in the right form.  And any form of SF should be able to be
considered for a Nebula, as long as it's in the right genre."

Our point, in the final analysis, was simply this: If SFWA will not
recognize scripts as SF for the Nebula, then they should not qualify
for membership in SFWA.  If SFWA *does* recognize them as SF for
purposes of membership, then they should be eligible for the Nebula.
It was real simple: you can't have it both ways.  Pick one.

But that didn't happen...the illogic, the contradiction was allowed
to continue, with SF scriptwriters held as second-class citizens
within SFWA.  In theory, a GOR novel could be considered for a
Nebula...but a Babylon 5 script could never even begin to be
considered because according to SFWA, it isn't a story, it isn't
real writing, it isn't literature, it is absent of quality, and
fundamentally, it ain't SF.

It was this issue that finally compelled me to resign from SFWA,
as had others before me.  That, and the insults, abuse, veiled
and not-so-veiled threats and harrassment I received from many
in SFWA over this issue.

And now you come to me...and you ask me to rejoin.  You say this
is because of my "stature and experience"...but what use can that
be to SFWA if my work and the work of every SF writer working in
television or film is dismissed as lacking in merit by virtue of
the form in which we work?  Since the bulk of my work is in TV,
how can SFWA consider what I have to be "stature" if it does not
recognize that there is any quality work in SF being done in TV?

I don't believe in stature, particularly and especially my own.
I'm still the same person I was when I resigned, for good or ill.
The only thing that matters to me, that has *ever* mattered to
me, is the work.  The storytelling.  This genre.  I love SF.  I
love the community of fandom that has embraced it, and given it
life.  I love the sense of wonder that is SF.

Subject: to sfwa from jms

[Continued]

In order to rejoin SFWA, I would have to accept the tacit
implication that my work is NOT SF...and this I will never do.

Last year, I realized a lifelong dream, and we received the Hugo
award for an episode of Babylon 5.  And I'll tell you a true
thing: I'll take the Hugo over the Nebula any day, because it
comes based on the quality of the work...it comes based on the
understanding that fans have that SF is SF, regardless of the
medium.  Where the pro community throws up barriers, and tidal
waves of snobbery, and play political games by defining SF as
whatever is most convenient for them, the fan community is open
to the free debate of one singular question: "Is it good SF?"

In light of that, what possible reason could I have for wanting
to rejoin SFWA?  To associate with writers who disdain the form
in which I work?  To try and educate them?  We tried that...and
got our heads handed to us.

It's not just the Nebula that's the concern...as before, I'm
willing to permanently disqualify anything I write, now or in
the future, from Nebula consideration, to set aside allegations
of self-interest; it's the principle of the thing that matters,
the desire to make this better for the next guy to come down this
road; and it's the attitude behind the current situation that
rankles, that worries me; the open hostility and prejudice
against those working in the visual media.

So thanks, but no thanks.

SFWA has chosen to ostracize film and television...and in the
end, has only hurt itself.  By sticking its head, ostrich-like,
in the sand, it has failed to come to grips with these new
media...has become isolated, so that no one in Hollywood thinks
of SFWA members, because SFWA thinks nothing of Hollywood.

The result?  Where once many SF novels were chosen as fodder for
movies, now movies and TV shows drive a substantial portion of
the novel market through licensing.  All too often now, books are
based on movies, when it *should* be the other way around, which
means that the audience is deprived of visual medium access to
some truly excellent work.  The publishing industry has become
more like Hollywood in many ways now, looking for the blockbuster,
losing the midlist, one megacompany swallowing up another.  We've
been there, done that, and could've helped.

(Now *here's* an irony I hadn't considered before just this
moment: while an episode of B5 is not eligible for a Nebula, a
novel based on B5 *is* eligible.  Where is the logic in that
one?  And here's another irony: one of the members who most
vociferously opposed the Dramatic Nebula on the grounds that
everything SF that came out of Hollywood was crap...well, his
name showed up recently on a list of writers asking to be
considered for an assignment to write one of the Babylon 5
novels.)

Because of SFWA's provincial attitudes toward those of us who
work in TV and film, it has lost access to secondary markets
and opportunities, costing its members potentially hundreds of
thousands of dollars.

If parts of this letter seem angry, or frustrated, you should
understand that the two areas of my life which have always meant
a great deal to me are my work in television, and SF as a genre.
I'm proud, have always been proud, of both.  Many producers
assigned to SF series deny they're doing SF, as though they were
ashamed of it.  I've always embraced the idea.  I was proud to
be a member of SFWA.  I was proud to write for television.  But
finally I had to choose between them, and that was a very
difficult, painful thing for me.  It still is.  It's like having
divorced parents; you want desperately for them to get along with
each other, somehow put it together again...but it doesn't happen
and doesn't look like it will *ever* happen.  So you get upset.

I'm not upset with you, John, or even many members of SFWA, a
number of whom weren't even members when all this went down a
few years ago.  It's simple frustration with a system, and a
certain loud proportion of the membership, that is provincial
and parochial.  A great deal of good could come out of a tighter
coordination between those of us working in the visual media,
and print authors.  To see that frittered away is maddenning.

Television and film are as valid a forum for the exploration
of science fiction as any short story or novel.  As long as
SFWA persists in saying otherwise, I will never rejoin that
organization.

Let me know when you folks get serious.  Let me know when you
are willing to consider that what we do in TV and film counts as
SF.  Then we'll talk.

But not before.

       I agree 100%.  One of the things I've been ragging on for years
is that you should bring in SF writers to work on SF shows.  Real
simple logic. But the perception there is that SF print authors can't
deal with, or are disdainful of, scripts...something SFWA perpetuated
when many of their members said they (as a group) wouldn't be able to
make sense of a script.

       There are some terrific resources out there who would be
invaluable to any SF series.  That's why I gave Peter David his first
shot at a live action TV series, ditto for Christy Marx and others.

       Yeah, we showed it glowing when Sinclair was catpured.  Since

       The only point of disagreement is that "SF on screen is
actually more of an accomplishment."  They're equal, in different ways,
and certainly a movie or TV show can, in time, start to look dated. 
But a book, which exists in your head, never grows old.

       Correct.  In many films, the director is there from the start,
working on the vision...in TV, a director comes in 2-3 weeks before you
shoot, and walks into a situation where the vision is already set.

                                                                  jms

"Have you ever considered directing?"

      With great trepidation, and at the urging of Warner Bros., I've
decided to direct one episode this season...not because I have any
particular ambition to be a director, but because I think it will help
me become a better writer by more fully understanding that side of the
camera.  Given how massively busy I am already, this decision will
almost certainly be called as evidence in any sanity trial that might
take place in future.

      The point of my "internal matters" reply was in response to
someone who wanted to know whom at SFWA to bombard with email about
this.  I'm reasonably confident that no one at SFWA wants to receive
such a bombardment, and such a bombardment would not do any good, hence
my observation.

      That's got nothing to do with the reality that SFWA's stance is
massively stupid, and deserves to be openly discussed.  As someone
once said, "When someone does a foolish thing you should tell them it
is a foolish thing; they may choose to continue doing it, but at least
the truth is where it needs to be."

      I'm certainly pleased to hear that GRRM is currently SFWA's
veep. George is a VNM (Very Nice Man).

      Of course, that's got nothing to do with SFWA's general attitude
toward this area, scriptwriters in general, or the dramatic nebula
(they get to like George because a) he's an accomplished novelist, and
b) he's a VNM, and ignore the rest of it if they so choose).  Still,
it's good news for George, and I'm pleased for him.  It's a good thing
to have George, since some others, like Harlan Ellison, also refuse to
rejoin SFWA over the dramatic nebula question, and the treatment of
scriptwriters in general.  George is a much more patient and generous
man.

                                                                  jms

"Why were they so interested in you directing?"

      Well, they know the show is really my vision, and they're
curious what it would look like if it was also followed through behind
the camera.  And as our liaison with WB said, "We like it when our
creative people spread their wings a little."  They like the show, and
it does well for them, and they're just generally supportive that way.

      Well, for starters, I don't think it would be letting someone
else win; nominees would be submitted, and the best of that batch of
nominees would win in head-to-head competition.  We've been bypassed
for the occasional Emmy nomination even though I think some of the work
done that year in those areas was at least as good as anything done
elsewhere...does that diminish the kudos to the ones who *did* win?

      Beyond which...even if SFWA *were* to start working on restoring
the dramatic nebula -- the chances of which are roughly equivilent to
an ostrich giving birth to an iguana -- it would take them a couple of
years minimum to do it, by which time B5 is over anyway, and who knows
if any later work of mine will be in the SF area at that point anyway? 
(It's likely, but one never do know...I ended up on Murder She Wrote
for 2 years, remember.)

      Either way...my concern is the principle at work here.  If
disqualifying or refusing the Neb myself is the only way to ensure that
this ain't a personal agenda, and thus make the road easier for
somebody else down the road, then that's jake by me.  But, as stated,
the odds of this are slim and none.

      I'd be hard to pick an absolute favorite; I like all of them,
for various reasons, and at various times.  If you put a gun to my
head, I'd say it was probably either Delenn or Londo, because of the
many shades to their characters.  They're like crystals, they change
color and texture depending on how the light shines through them.

      The goal was to *redeem* himself.  Sparing Sheridan was part of
that. Then he had to surrender himself to his greatest fear: his death
at G'Kar's hands.

      Yes, some Minbari on the Grey Council think that Sinclair opened
up the "soul door," for lack of a better term, and Delenn's actions can
be seen as a kind of back-fire, closing the door again.  Ain't
necessarily what's true, but what they believe.

      And yes, they would've had Delenn remain childless, but would be
allowed to marry a Minbari.  And, again, it's a matter of marrying a
non-Minbari with or WITHOUT kids...it's a very inflammatory sort of
thing from a cultural perspective.

      But, see, Mike, there's the contradiction...when you talk about
SFWA being tolerant and inviting, you're generalizing from the
individuals to the group.  But when I do the same, you say, "No, no,
those are just the individuals."  When enough individuals say
something, it becomes a group opinion, and hence an organizational
opinion.

      Basically, you're saying that if the action is *positive*, it's
SFWA the organization speaking...if the action is *negative*, it's just
the members talking, thus giving the group deniability.

      You can't have it both ways, Mike.

       Okay, Mike...so the organization speaks for itself.  Over on
GEnie, George Martin came in, and speaking as Vice President for SFWA,
speaking for the *group*, said, of my statement to disqualify myself
from future Nebulas to show that this isn't part of a vested interest
on my part but rather the principle, "Don't you have enough awards,
Joe?"  When another fan reminded him of my statement given above, he
said, "You cannot disqualify yourself from a Nebula, and I suspect Joe
knew that."  (Which I didn't.)  In essense he first questions my
motives and my ethics, then assaults my honesty, as his way of dealing
with my raising the issue.  (I then made it plain that I will not 
accept any Nebula in future, regardless, if that's what it takes,
though I think most people knowing you don't want one will tend to
discourage voting in that area.)

       So now what is this, George speaking as George, or George
speaking for SFWA the organization?  Because when he came in he sure as
heck made it clear that he was speaking in his capacity as VP.

       Sorry, Mike, but the organization acts as its members act, and
speaks as its members speaks, and George's intemperate reaction, to
immediately and gratuitously go for the personal attack rather than
discussing the issue, when I had never said a WORD about any one person
in this discussion, just shows again why many are afraid to pursue this
issue any more.  They're tired of the petty, personal attacks, and so
am I, from many of the members AND the organization and its
spokespersons.  Because an organization doesn't exist as some kind of
Platonic ideal, outside reality (though in this I sometimes wonder if
SFWA is outside reality).  It says in the Bible, "You shall know them
by their works."  An organization is known by what it does, and what
it says, through its members.  So you can try and divorce the two all
you want, but they're the same thing.

                                                                  jms

       I think we've got WB more aware of the preservation issues once
some of the original prints of shots from the pilot were eaten by rats
while in storage facilities.  (The negatives are safe.)  We spoke to
them.

       I think one can make the argument there is some symbolism in
there from christian literature, but that kind of scene takes place in
other belief systems as well, and historically that sort of torture was
used in many places, including the Roman empire in general.

       I've found it's generally best to *see* what one does before
deciding whether not to be disappointed by it.  And I really have no
interest in running the story by anyone for approval or to make sure
they think it'll be okay, and along the way destroy any possible
interest in *seeing* it since the story is already out there on the
nets.

      Actually, there'd be no rush at all in terms of getting a sequel
into prep and out the door.  The discussions now are in the area of
fall 97 to shoot and January 98 to air (with or without a simultaneous
S5 of B5).  We have a lot of the stuff we'd need for the sequel
(costumes, uniforms, some sets, prosthetics, that sort of thing), so
the lead time would be very short.
