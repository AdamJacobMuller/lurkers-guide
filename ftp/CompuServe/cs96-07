      They're going out in batches; anyone who hasn't received one
within the next week or two, let me know.  Somebody started sending
them out bulk mail; they'll go out henceforth either 1st or 2nd class
mail.

      No, everything I've heard concurs with your assessment. 
Basically, we have a lot of mutual friends in common, and the name just
came up in conversation.

      Of course, Delenn was trying to save Sheridan from blipping off
forever into the time stream, so it *did* serve that purpose as well,
so it did work within the plot.

      Usually I carry it around in my head; if I need to quote
verbatim from a prior episode, for a flashback or the like, then I tend
to drag out the script and read it; it's easier than fast-forwarding
through videotape.

      I do tend to rewatch episodes as they're aired in reruns, making
sure nothing untoward happens to them.

                                                                  jms

Subject: Don't wanna hear that!

{original post unavailable}

      My sense is that these things tend to go in cycles; if you were
around in the Roaring Twenties, with flappers, jazz, and (to say the
least) a lapse in morals that went into the first part of the 1930s,
you'd extrapolate from that to say that the 1950s, by virtue of being
20 years down the road, would be even MORE loose, more immoral, wilder.
But, in fact, the 50s were extremely conservative.  And most of the SF
of the time looked to a future that was as button-down as the present
of their writers.  Then the looser 60s and 70s, and a rebirth of some
extent of conservatism in the Reagan 80s and for health reasons.

      The day someone perfects, and distributes, a guaranteed Aids
vaccine, I think you're going to see another sexual revolution that'll
make the 60s look like a dinner party.

      So by the time of B5, we're in a bit of a conservative swing
again, in terms of sexual matters (which often tends to come about
post-war).

      That's all very encouraging, thanks.  Yeah, it's kind of a fun
episode, all soft and fuzzy on the outside, with REAL big teeth on the
inside.  I like that kind of episode a lot.  It's wonderfully
subversive.

      The problem with putting in clips from previous episodes is that
we only have about 42-43 minutes to tell our story.  If we put in 30
seconds or 1 minute of clips from last week, that leaves us with 1 less
minute to tell our story this week, and in this show, we need every
second we can get.

                                                                  jms

      In short form, since this would take forever otherwise...they
were a fairly large empire at one time, but in areas which didn't
really connect with what was going on with the last shadow war.  They
were more or less out of it. The downfall of the republic was mainly
entropy, it's nearly impossible to maintain control of an empire
covering light years (or even thousands of miles, as the early British
Empire discovered, among others), and in that process, the Narn were
basically the final insult.

      At Chicago, the assumption was still that the UK wouldn't be
getting the final 5 until the US did.  But since now they'll be getting
new (to the US) episodes starting in August, keeping the title quiet
now seems kind of a moot issue.

      There were chairs there, but I would've been low-eye level, and

      Well, a telepath can also hold it back and avoid dipping any
further into someone's mind, if not permitted or asked not to do so.

       S.M. Stirling's credits are beyond reproach, and if you don't
know who that is, or what he's done, then the loss is yours...and
you're simply showing your ignorance here of written SF.  And we've had
lots of other quality SF writers doing our books, like Neal Barrett Jr.
and Lois Tilton and John Vornholt, among others.  But I guess maybe you
don't know who THEY are either.

       That's okay...they don't know who you are, either.

       Re: the comic...yes, WB did want DC to do it originally, and
they did so for some time.  But they're really not set up these days to
do much licensed stuff, the Star Trek books and other licensed stuff
have pretty much all gone to other publishers.  Creatively, things
weren't working out, and in reality, WB can get more from an outside
company that pays larger bucks for the license than with an in-house
company which doesn't have to.

       So again, your facts don't touch reality at any two contiguous
points.

       And yes, there *is* a large demand for B5 merchandise.  And if
you used this forum for any purpose other than to issue snide
commentaries, you would know that from *day one* on this series, I've
stated very openly that I do not WANT a lot of merchandising on this
show while it's in production. I'm taking the Calvin and Hobbes model
on this one.  I said here, in front of all the users on CIS, GEnie and
elsewhere, long before we were ever in a position to even get offers,
that I intended to drag my feet on licensing, because I've been
involved with, or seen too often shows in which the tail began wagging 
the dog, where merchandise begins to drive the show.

       I refuse to allow that to happen with B5.  It's real simple:
you tell the story first.  Make the show first.  Then, when it's all
done, if it's a hit, and ours is growing steadily, then there's all the
time in the world to do some merchandising.  If not, it's a moot
question anyway.  For every 10 prospective licensing deals that come
through my hands, I appove only 1, and usually with a great deal of
conditions involved, and direct creative supervision.

       Bill Watterson could've made gazillions of dollars licensing
all kinds of Calvin and Hobbes stuff.  His friends wanted him to, the
company REALLY wanted him to, others couldn't understand why he
wouldn't do it...but he understood the importance of the story, and the
product.  Take care of that first, and the rest will attend to itself
later.  He made a good living doing what he was doing, and I do okay
too...how much more do you need?

       I guess it's beyond your comprehension that anyone would
actually turn down money, or want to do something for reasons other
than money. Again, the loss is yours.

                                                                  jms

      It'd be either a guarantee from a cable network -- which would
let us do a lot more in terms of language and hard storylines -- or
syndication. This show wouldn't have lasted long on the networks, which
invariably tend to interfere creatively, and only give short orders to
start.  This is a very eccentric show....

      The Earth/Minbari war ended in 2247, and there were several

      The membership in the League varies widely and frequently, so a
good count is difficult.

      The majority of races are within that range because that's as
far as they've gone in putting in navigational beacons, without which
traveling in hyperspace can be extremely dangerous.  You sort of inch
your way outwards.

      Well, logically, you could backtrack from there to figure out
exactly when Sheridan and Delenn...er...get together.  I'd rather let
that come along at its own pace.

> Any Nemmy onminations?

       John Flinn got a nomination for cinematograhy for "Inquisitor."
Last year we sent videotapes of our up-for-nomination episodes, and got
three nominations for it.  But WB got upset by this -- they don't do
this for their other shows, we did it on our own -- and ordered us not
to do it again.  The other shows don't need it because they're network
shows and get good exposure; most syndicated shows (non-Trek) tend not
to be Emmy aspirees, so it's not a problem there.  We're in between,
and we were, in effect, producing videotapes, and they didn't want
that.  So we had to sit on our hands and not do what we knew would
result in getting more noms. It's very frustrating.

                                                                  jms

      It is, not to put too fine a point on it...EXTREMELY important
to see "Shadow Dancing."  If they choose to cut the nasty bits that's
one thing, it won't affect what You Need To See, but to not run it at
all would be a disaster of substantial dimensions.  Still, I imagine
they'll run it; the nasty bits can be excised pretty well, if
necessary, I should think.

      No, I don't think so, because that plunges you too deeply into
the mire of situational morality or situational ethics.  Granted,
there's always a certain element of situational judgment in these
things ("It's wrong to kill. The martians are about to flatten the
country.  KILL 'EM.")  But the decision making process should, ideally,
be on what seems the *right* thing to do rather than the *convenient*
thing to do.

      Thanks.  I saw ID4 this week, and on one level, could enjoy it
for the technical expertise (I think they ate our lunch in some visual
areas, and now somebody else is doing Big Fleet stuff, so we have to
work to stay ahead of the curve again).  But story wise, yeah, there
was some massively dopey stuff in there.

      In "Legacies" the question of caste heritage had more to do with
how your death is handled than what you're determined to be in life.

 Darran Williams <101656.2143@compuserve.com> asks:
> 2) Who sings the songs?

       No, not a career move; it's not widely known -- I guess mainly
because I haven't ever mentioned it much -- but from time to time I've
written songs. Mainly the lyrics; I know how the music should sound,
but I'm incapable of reading music...I think it's the same mental
glitch that hits me when I try to do certain kinds of math.  "X is a
numerical value." "No, X is a letter, 7 is a numerical value."  I can't
ever seem to make the one equal the other in my head.  Similarly, a
black note on a piece of paper isn't the music...anyway, it's a
glitch.)

       So when I write songs, and I have a specific melody I'm hearing
in my head, I'm invariably placed in the humiliating position (since I
can't play a musical instrument) of humming it, or somehow trying to
suggest it to the music-person.  Suffice to say it looks really goofy
and stupid.

       Anyway...despite this, I do sometimes write songs, and like to
keep my hand in, as they say.  I did two songs for an ABC-TV prime-time
Real Ghostbusters special, did a few songs that have been recorded by
small groups (you've never heard of any of them, trust me), another
song that, much to my chagrin, is apparently still being used in church
songbooks (and that's all I will ever say about that)...and when I
decided to do a show with a singer for B5, I wrote a couple of songs
for that one, with Chris Franke providing the music.

       They're bluesy, Billie Holliday kinds of songs, updated
slightly. I'm actually very pleased with how they came out (Erica
Gimpel, one of the cast members from Fame, plays the part and sings the
songs).  Several folks around here want either or both songs to come
out on the next B5 album, but I"m loathe to do so, on the theory that
the soundtracks work better in the style we've already used, all
instrumental.  (There've even been some inquiries from music people
who've heard the songs about releasing them commercially, but that
would mean adding about 30 seconds to each song to make them airplay 
compatible, and I'm not sure I want to take on the extra hassle just
now.)

                                                                  jms

      I'm also the executive producer, I basically *make* the show,
overseeing every aspect of production, hiring directors, actors,
supervising sets, costumes, efx, you name it.

      It takes 7 days to film an episode.  My favorite is probably
"Shadow Dancing," which you haven't seen yet, mainly because I haven't
been able to poke any holes in it yet.  It's a good ep.

      Bear in mind that there have been lots of folks named Sinclair
in the last 900 years; that we don't know how much Valen told anyone
about his prior life; that the Minbari had had little to no direct
contact with the Vorlons in well over a hundred years and likely would
not have told them what they found at the Battle of the Line until such
time as personal contact had been made again, which only happened at
Kosh's arrival...and there wasn't exactly time to make a report after
he rolled into B5 for the first time.

Thanks...to your questions:

"1. presumably Adira was actually poisoned by Mordens cronies, since
he was looking for a way to hurt Londo, and we saw him finding out
information about her?"

Correct.

"2. In the final credits, a ranger is mentioned. I don't remember
seeing any rangers in this episode - where did he come in?"

His scene was snipped for time, it was a small one, didn't add much to
the story, but you have to keep those credits in under SAG rules.

"3. Will we ever find out why Kosh allowed himself to be "poisoned" in
the pilot episode now?"

You're assuming he allowed it.

"4. What was the flash of light running across B5 when Kosh died?"

A non-localized phenomenon.

"5. Early on, when Sheriden was talking to Delenn, he wants to know
"what the Shadows are really after". Delenn looks like she is
resolutely not saying anything and hoping that the conversation moves
on before Sheriden presses for an answer... which it does. Does Delenn
know what the shadows are after (considering the war from a 1000 years
ago, I would have thought that the star faring Minbari would have had
pretty good records)?"

They do, and she does, and she's making a few mistakes that may come
back to haunt her in the not too distant future.

"6. Will you tell us? (answer = cryptic "YES" no doubt!)"

In the fullness of time.

                                                                  jms

      To the two parts of this...yes, there's always been the
undercurrent in the series that says we are our brother's keeper, that
we have an obligation to look out for one another.  If we're bound and
determined to seek our own destruction nothing can stop that...but
anything less, and a kind word in the right place, an action taken at
the right time, can bend history and help others.  This is part of the
community sense that comes through so strongly in B5.

      And yes, there are sometimes themes that come out without my
knowing it; sometimes I wear my heart on my sleeve more than I
intended, and stuff slips through, thematically and dialogue-wise, that
later I see and wish I'd left out.  Sometimes it'll be much later when
I'll realize what a character was REALLY saying when s/he whispered a
line or two into my brain, and I'll perceive again that the characters
are smarter than I am sometimes...and take that thematic element and
run with it.

       Because putting Ambassador at the start of each name would look

before it scrolled off; because Delenn and G'Kar only have the one
name, and to break it for Londo...well, what the heck.  So the Centauri
get screwed for a change, it's about time.

       A personal transport is assigned to one vorlon for life,
changing and evolving over time.  Little fighters have a more primitive

       I think it'd be hard to just drop in Garibaldi's attitudes
about Valen without it having something to do with an episode; if it
doesn't move that particualr episode along, it shouldn't be there.  So
that sort of thing is tough to pull off, making the show more
unfriendly to new viewers.

       No, it's not vapor.  Many people *have* received their stuff. 
So it's there, and it's working, but there have been some glitches in
the post office side that blindsided us.  A "vapor club" is one where
you sign up and get nothing, because nothing's made or delivered.  Many
people here and elsewhere *have* received their full packets, and
newsletters, and the posters are going out shortly, now that WB has
*finally* approved the design, which took longer than it should have.

       For starters, I didn't resolicit anyone, the fan club message
gets popped up by the system.  Second, new applicants have less of a
chance of getting left in the lurch than the folks who dived in at the
beginning when we were still putting all the pieces into position.

       If you have *any* reservations, we will happily refund your
money. Or you can give it a bit of time; we can't know who hasn't
gotten their stuff until we hear from them, and/or the post office
sends back the material, which has begun to happen.  We're dealing with
it as fast as possible.

       PS...I just went down the hall to ask Jim Lockett about what
the status of things was, and there was a huge pile of newsletters and
packets on his desk ready to go out.  I asked about yours in
particular, and he had it right there, about ten down in the "to-mail"
pile.  So you should have the stuff shortly.

       Yes, by all means, I can't exactly lay claim to a patriarchal
system, after all.  And that's what Kosh tends to play into, the whole
father aspect, though others might take the other approach in this.

       My gut instinct would be that the Olympics would still be
almost exclusively an Earth/human thing, we have to keep some things to
ourselves, as part of our unique heritage.  And they're probably still
going on.

       And that's good.  Too much of TV is just the plot/action stuff,
not much emotional content.  For me, drama done well should make you
feel something.  That's vitally important to me.

       That happens after we turn it over to WB, during the dubbing

       No, the songs are in "Walkabout," which is the next episode up

       When Delenn takes off her stabalizer and puts it on Sheridan,
taking on his suit for whatever small protection it might offer, at
that point he stabalized and she became lost/unstuck in time.  So it
was she who appeared in the last sequence there.  She took the risk to
ensure saving Sheridan.

       Thanks.  The different color just goes to show some measure of
individuality in design, and there are some hierarchies implied here.

      Thanks, and in theory, yes, you could carry on without the

rather than the place itself.

       I don't have the specs onhand, but basically you've got a
smidge under 1g in the inner levels, working out until you've got a
smidge over 1g in the areas closest to the hull.  This helps with alien
requirements in living quarters in those areas.
