      Well, starting from the death of Kosh, we've been in the myth
cycle. That now has to play itself out.

      And thanks.

Subject: JMS Hospital rumor FALSE

{original post had no questions}

      Kevin: by reposting this information in any form whatsoever, you
have contributed grief to my life.  The stage was flooded with phone
calls while I was at the editing bays about this.

      There is this crummy logic in internetdom which says, "since
information is power, my status can increase the faster I can get info
out to others."

      This kind of rumor is hurtful.  It causes me grief in running it
down; it tied up the switchboard at work; it harrassed many people at
work.

      Understand this absolutely clearly: if anything ever does
happen, I have people at the stage who will post specific and precise
information.  If ever you see a rumor about this, you know *instantly*
that it's not true, because if it were true, it would come instantly
from those involved, and you wouldn't have to HEAR it from any other
source.

      The original poster was bad enough; reposting gossip, rumors or
other nonsense is just as bad.  You should never have posted it in the
first place; many people cited your message as the reason they were
tying up our switchboard.

      Never, ever do this to me again.

      Am I perfectly, crystal clear?

                                                                  jms

      Well, look what happened when the shadows came out and attacked
a couple of places...first they did so without anyone knowing it was
them doing it, as we've shown.  So now everyone's running around like
ants, scurrying for cover and trying to figure out what the hell's
going on, accusing one another...then the Centauri got the credit/blame
for it, causing further conflict...then they came out and sent everyone
scurrying again, some to make alliances they thought would protect
themselves (and thus enable them to make war on their neighbors, as
shown), only to have that fall apart and they turn on themselves/each
other.

                                                                  jms

      Thanks.  The details are everything, in a show like this, and
it's great when they're appreciated.

      As for season one...we learned last week that when the show is
finally over, TNT will be stripping the show, starting with the pilot
straight through all the seasons.  Stripping means airing every day, 5
days a week.  I think it'll be great.

      Thank you.  You're most kind.

      Funny, on the line about "started watching B5 waiting for it to
impress me."  I've heard much the same from many others.  I think we've
all been burned so many times by SF shows that we had a real burden
here to prove what we could do, and how we would do it.  You kinda
don't want to have your heart broken anymore.  I'm glad we were able to
come through.  It's a show I'm very proud of.

      It means it's done on assignment, as part of a package, rather
than buying something created independently and acquiring the rights.

      Yes, we used their actual wedding photos.

      And I did see the Dynamic Druggie Duo on Roseanne (the only time
I've ever watched it).  They were in fine form.

      Thanks.  I'll string out the Sheridan info for a while; as for
Morden, as he said, his associates can repair flesh, replace flesh
(though where they got replacements from is something I don't want to
know)....

      It's definitely a packed episode.  I still find myself realizing
that the end of act one feels like two acts.  And the next three are
every bit as intense, if not moreso.  I love it....

      I know little of any use about acting.  I don't know if being an
extra helps or not; most extras I know do only that, nothing more, and
if you have no lines, you can't progress.  Acting seminars are
necessary and good, but the high priced exploitive ones are to be
avoided.  Best to have her hook up with a theater and do a lot of that;
most of our actors on the show, guest and regulars, are folks with lots
of theatrical (stage) training and experience.

      Innocent and fragile is a good description...and certainly the
dialogue is written that way, and we cast him because he matches that
character.

      Thanks.  It's a terrific episode.  The music now echoes season
one because in some thematic areas, we're starting to bend back on
ourselves, and close some circles, as you'll see soon.

      That it affects the emotions is, for me, the goal.  If you can
make an audience *feel* something, in a medium as cold as TV, you've
done your job right.

      That's an extremely good and cogent analysis.  And you hit the
theme right on the head, one we'll explore in year four with the
Vorlon/Shadow situation...and which was presaged in "Infection," right
in the first season, the first episode shot.  Sinclair says, in the
ultimate moment in that conflict, "You forgot the first rule of the
fanatic: When you become obsessed with the enemy, you *become* the
enemy."  That is what is happening here, with these two and other
parties.

      It all comes together....

       Thank you.  I can only hope that you are proven right by time,
and that the Nobel committee hears about it....

       As for answers...since I have none to give, I can't shove them
down anyone's throats.  And if I did have them, they'd only be *my*
answers, not anybody else's, so again, there's no point.

       I'm a big believer in the power of critical thinking; don't
just have an opinion, have an *informed* opinion, and challenge it
yourself, be rigorous.  Even if you come back to the same opinion
later, at least you will now be able to defend or explain your view
rationally.

      It means I have some ideas that work for me, but no Answers that
could work for anyone else.  I have rules and guidelines based on what
seems basic ethical behavior...but I'm constantly working to revise
them, and question if they work as well as they might.

      Actually, the shadows are *much* older technologically than a
thousand years...that's just what Anna promised Sheridan we could jump
ahead, between 1 and 10,000 years.  They're profoundly older than that.

      Thanks.  RE: the opening...exactly.  The B5 story is told from
everyone's point of view, and they're all a part of it, so the opening
now reflects that.  And it gives me the chance to do an opening that's

      Ambassadors have been learning as they've gone along; I took the

they've gotten better.  The grunts/lower echelons, though, are still

door like image on the B5 web page, www.thestation.com based on our
doors (as I recall).

      We may do some TV movies to expand upon the arc, show things we
couldn't show in the series for budget reasons, but nothing cinematic
planned.

      Yes, the last piece there is kind of the key, isn't it?

      I've always kept the minister just that, no name, for the
reasons you cite.  This is someone wh's a survivor, who bends with the
wind, and somehow keeps going by not being noticed, or taken seriously.

      And yes, this season I was noticing that eyes have become a
predominant image, from Lyta to the shadows to Lorien to some stuff
coming in the next few episodes...funny, how this stuff creeps up on
you.

"Would YOU have continued with Babylon 5, in the way you have done so,
without the feedback from fans?"

      Absolutely.  More than anything else, I'm making the show, and
telling this story, for myself; it's the story I'd want to see.  I'm
doing it because I can't *not* do it.

"Do you feel the critasism. both positive and negative, to be an asset
or a burden?"

      Neither.  It's a sense of the room, which is always good, but in
general what you find is that for everything you do in a given episode,
there will be some who hate it, and some who love it...there is no
single strong concensus. So what you have to do is to just listen to
the inner voice of the story and follow that, regardless.  If you start
trying to second guess everyone's reaction...that way madness lies.

      On a personal side, it can sometimes be a bit stressful, but I
said I'd be accountable one way or another, and that promise stands.

"when will the new cd (soundtrack) come out?"

      I'm going to be getting the soundtrack in about 10 days from
Chris, so I can listen and approve or give notes.  That's the last
stage; the artwork is done, the liner notes are in, everything's done. 
So it should be fairly quickly thereafter.

"will corwin get a bigger role, and a spot on the openning credits?"

      There are currently no plans for that; the main cast is big
enough as it is.

"and, the names of who narrated the openning of season four in the
order they narrated in?"

      I have to do this from memory, but I think it's Bill, Jeff,

Bruce.

      Thanks.  This one's a favorite of mine as well.  On the
Garibaldi scene, it was shot fairly conventionally, but as we got into
editing, I said, "Let's do something we don't normally do, let's try a
visual approach that's not usually part of SF shows."  So we put that
sequence together.  Again, my feeling is, break your format once in a
while or get stuck in a rut.  Take chances.  The worst that'll happen
is that you'll fail.

      It's a lovely episode.

      I dunno...I hear frequently from people who've joined the show
at much later points, and after just a couple of eps, are pretty much
up to speed. Certainly the recap is designed to help.

      It's not a captain's bar it's a stat bar (gold for command, gold
and silver for command/administrative liaison, red for medical, green
for security), and it's Sheridan's.

"My point is that orientation, that who you fall in love with, is not
a matter of choice! Why would I choose a marginal position in society?
I operate very much in the mainstream as a senior executive in a large
multinational corporation and believe me - being openly gay is not the
most career enhancing thing I've ever done by a long shot! It is not
chosen and I don't believe you can switch orientation like changing
socks."

      Ah, but you see, here you are revealing your *own* prejudices. 
The gay community has adopted the "ther is no choice, this is how
you're born" argument for many political and social reasons, some of
them sound and reasonable, some of them less so.

      You say you want to enhance choices, but in that one paragraph
alone you are restricting the choices of others...one can not explore,
one cannot change one way or another, one is locked in for life.  Now,
in many cases, this may be true...but it is not true in all places, at
all times, for all people, and the lack of tolerance for lifestyle
choices you indicate does not speak well for you.

      I have many friends who are gay.  I have many friends who are
bi.  I know women who were involved with men exclusively for most of
their lives, then got involved with women exclusively for a number of
years.  Some are still there, and happy, some have flipped back again.

      The far right uses political agendas to restrict the choice of
other people..."nobody's naturally born gay, it's all teaching, and
it's against god's law," which is nonsense...and I'd hate very much to
see the same politicization going on at the *other* end of the
spectrum, in which there are only gays, and straights, and no room to
maneuver, and anybody else has something wrong with them somewhere.

      You go that way, and you're just exchanging a closet for a
straightjacket.  This, by my lights, is not progress.

      Okay, it's time for the usual recitation of email rules.

      1) Please do not send me inquiries about the storyline in
private email. You may think, "Well, it's just me," but at last Neilsen
count there were about 15 million of you out there, and only one of me.
I can't get into lengthy discussions about the plot or storylines in
email.  I end up answering the same questions multiple times, and the
answers go to only one person at a time.  If you have a story question,
ASK IT IN A PUBLIC FORUM, NOT IN EMAIL, so that others can benefit from
the answers.

      2) Please, please, PLEASE do not send me story ideas in email.

      3) Do not send jpgs or anything else that requires downloading;
I was hit by a trojan horse and virus lately, and consequently I have a
very firm no-download policy on anything else coming into me via email.

      4) Private email should be used for things you cannot discuss in
a public forum, or for which confidentiality is needed for other
reasons.  I'm swamped with 500 messages a day...if it doesn't have to
be sent email, please don't do so.

      5) Requests for agent suggestions, or requests to read your
scripts or stories, will be met by stony silence.

      6) We cannot give studio tours, or afford to send out scripts,
or story bibles, or actor photographs.  When the actors do this, bear
in mind that it is a kindness *that comes out of their own pockets*, as
there is no budget from WB to send photos.

      I hate to be as brusque as this, but I'm starting to get
overloaded with email, and an occasional pruning seems necessary.

      Many thanks.

{original post unavailable}

       You really are misusing the term "deus ex machina," Jim.  If
you look up what it actually means, it refers to something that comes
up at the end of the story, out of nowhere, and saves the situation. 
"God in a box" as it's usually called.  It's a cheat because it isn't
referenced or built up earlier.

       Telepathy is not a deus ex machina device in the show -- it's
been there since the pilot -- nor in SF as a genre.  Telepathy has a
long and respected history in the SF genre, with "The Demolished Man"
considered one of the greatest landmarks of the field.

       Nor is telepathy used in the show as the end-all solution,
which *also* negates the deus ex machina notion.  Look at "Shadow
Dancing."  The teeps helped, but it wasn't a case of shooting
motionless ships...it was an all-out bloody fight where our guys lost 3
ships for every 1 they killed. That, to me, ain't deus ex *anything*.

       For what it's worth, the latter half or two-thirds of year 4
takes a much more hard SF approach to things, moving away from the myth
cycle into other territory.

                                                                  jms

      You must go to the convention operators and explain to them that
by allowing these bootleg tapes to be sold, they are violating
copyright laws and risk being acted against legally by WB.  They have
an obligation to ensure that pirated material is not sold at their
conventions, and if they will not enforce it voluntarily, WB will hold
them responsible, and in some cases, have already done this at
conventions.

      Reading and writing is what I *do*.

      Perhaps what you said was not what you meant.

      It's my experience that unless you can say what you mean, you
can never mean what you say.

      What was written was a very intolerant message about bi's, and
based upon that point of view, you gigged the show for not applying a
political agenda.  I don't think something as inherently personal and
intimate as sex should be politicized by either end of the spectrum,
and used to dismiss one class or another because of it.  I'm an
extremist for tolerance.

inaccurately, or paraphrased, or otherwise changed, please let me know

      I have been honest, and remain so.  I have said, repeatedly,
that at this point WB does not know.  Different departments have said
different things, all of them mutally contradictory.  At one time it
sounded like that might be a possibility, and some of the cast talked
about this at the time; that was before ratings started coming in on
the final 5 and the new eps, which have been extremely strong and
continuing to build.  I can say that WB has, itself, initiated
discussions about a fifth season several times over just the last few
weeks.

      What I'm doing is keeping my options flexible...the way it's
being written now is such that it allows me to flip either way. 
There's a certain built-in drop-dead point in that structure, but that
isn't near yet.

      This is what I've been saying all along.  I have been extremely
forthcoming about this, telling as much as *I* know at this point.  So
I do somewhat resent your suggesting that I do what I am doing, and
have been doing from day one.

Subject: John in the Underworld

{original post unavailable}

      THANK you.  I've mentioned elsewhere that I was going more for
the roots of this.  Though the Dante thread you mention is closest in
many ways (again, you dig into archetypes you end up with similar
structures, that's the nature of the beast), it was Orpheus going into
the underworld for his wife, and losing her, that was in the back of my
head when I was blocking out that part of the story.  (You can also
toss in Christ's temptation by the devil, and descent into the
wilderness, if you want.)

      This will probably get me in trouble, but...on the one hand, I
am always delighted and impressed with the breadth and depth of
analyses and thought of the larger group of SF fans, and the
insightfulness with which they apply those perceptions.

      On the flip side of this discussion...for a certain percentage
of them, that breadth and depth is only or primarily within SF and
mainstream fantasy. The wellspring of material from which to draw when
making comparisons is not often as broad as it should be in classical
literature, mythology, medieval studies, and so on.  They see a drop
into a chasm, they think "Oh, Gandalf." Not understanding that the root
of this goes back way, way, way further...to Orpheus and his kindred
spirits.

      I was copied a note from someone on another newsgroup who
insisted that everything in the show had an elvish/Tolkein base,
including and *especially* the names of everyone, citing the Agamemnon
as meaning something or other in LoTR elvish.  The symbol is RIGHT
THERE, in the name, Agamemnon, and the whole unfortunate history of
that character and his wife, and the Cassandra character (which is at
the center of G'Kar's character)...and yet she says, "No, no, it's all
a clue, it means this thing over here."

      My background is as an SF fan myself, so I offer the above
without stereotype or pejorative intent.  But as well as reading SF, I
spent most of my early adult life reading from classical sources. 
Goethe's FAUST informs Londo in many ways, as well as the history of
early Rome, and Hegelian notions on the role of conflict, and the
divine role of the emperor.  You're talking to someone who read
Plotinus' The Aenneads just for kicks, and whose favorite character was
Zeno and his paradoxes.  You want to talk Plato's perfect forms? The
Socratic method of teaching?  Greek tragic structure as embodied in 
Oedipus?   The overall work of Sophocles?  The Bible?  I've read that
one cover to cover twice...anyone else in the room who's done that,
raise your hands and tell me you didn't fall asleep halfway through
Numbers and Deuteronomy, the two most boring books in the whole darned
thing.

      There was a period in my life -- from around 1976 through 1981
 -- when I devoured everything I could in these areas.  Mythology. 
Existentialism. Zen. 18th century literature.  I took part time jobs in
libraries so I could get access to the widest possible range of books,
especially new ones in areas that interested me.  A lot of the details
have washed away over the years, but the cumulative *sense* of that
remains.  I can still remember how excited I was when a brand new
translation of the Inferno, the Purgatario and the Paradisio came out
(from Penguin, I think), putting it all back into the proper lyric
form, and I devoured them, one day each, then read them all again using
the footnotes and marginalia.

      All that time, I never knew I was preparing myself to write this
show, because it could *only* be done with a generalist background,
knowing a little about a lot of areas...just enough to get into
trouble, ususally, but still the grounding is there.

      Funny thing...about two, three weeks ago, I got an email from a
woman who is a professor of medieval studies at a major university, who
said she'd been nudged into watching the show by her graduate students,
and is now a big fan of the show.  She said that as she watched, she
"clicked" constantly on the sources from medieval and classical
literature, mythology, and other deep well sources, and was pleased to
see them being used in a contermporary or futuristic venue.

      Anyway, it's what I've always said about this show...you see the
paradigm with which you are most familiar.  Sometimes that's great,
and sometimes it's a curse.

                                                                  jms

       That's the whole point.  That interview was conducted fresh on
the heels of renewal, and we were getting mixed signals from WB (still
are, actually), and different people were telling people different
things.  It's subsequent to that interview -- remember, there's a LOT
of lead time on these magazines -- that the ratings began to come in,
and WB began initiating talks about a fifth season, and the sequel. 
You don't do a sequel unless the show is doing well.

      Since your question embodies a complexity of thought I have yet

Further, there are NO plans or intents for the sequel, if it becomes a
reality, to go to the WB network.

       I've worked out the details for 1,000 years in either direction
for the B5 storyline in general, and in specific for 100 years in
either direction; there's no chance of anything getting watered down no
matter what happens...there's enough story there for several novels. 
And WB is currently very interested in the side-story/sequel series
that I've mentioned from the beginning is a possibility.

       No, that wouldn't really be practical.  If someone wants to
*compare* it with LoTR, a compare and contrast thing, that's something
I don't have a problem with...to be even included in the same breath
with LoTR is a great compliment.  It's the notion that something was
*adapted* from that, or some other work, that sometimes drives me
crazy...but I wouldn't wish to set that forth as a rule...the rules are
only as absolutely necessary, not for this sort of thing.

      I always have to have the title before I begin writing, since it
sets the whole tone for the episode.  I can labor for hours just coming

      The WB stores/catalog generally don't carry items from many of

technically a WB show, it only distributes the show, so I'd say the
odds are slim and none.

      I don't think Minbari galvanize in quite the same way...with
them, I think it's more a gradual, growing relationship, and as many
do, there's just one day when the closeness crosses a point without you
almost being aware of it...and there it is.

      The eyes have metallic gold contact lenses; you can't see them
as well in the red light, but later, you'll see them better.

       I figured Londo would've bribed the guards to shut down the
bugs. Also, there's reason to bug a political figure's quarters...but a
cell in which there is just one person, who in theory has no allies
with whom to conspire...that would likely have a low priority.

 T.P. Chai <104674.3064@compuserve.com> asks:
> BTW did you get those CTS gloves and do they help?

       The director implements the script, as written.  They work with
the actors to bring out subtext and the full understanding of the
scene, but the script is written as it's written, and they know that. 
There's no room here for messing around on set.

       Where our directors tend to shine is in their visual sense.  We
try to bring a certain amount of style to our episodes, and to
encourage our directors to take chances, try things they might not
otherwise get a chance to do.  The more complex the shot, the longer it
takes to set it up, and most TV shows just concentrate on bagging the
shot and moving on.  Others, like X-Files and a growning number of
other shows, including B5, encourage a more filmic look.

       What we want in a director is someone who understands what the
vision is, and is oriented toward executing the text.

       And yes, got the CTS gloves...they're a little soft, and don't
provide the requisite support as well as they might, but I'm giving
them a little more time before I decide that completely.

                                                                  jms

       It seemed a bit much for Stephen to both act and direct in the
same episode, and yes, it's *that* Tony Dow.

       You're right...someone should get outraged...and will.  It's
simply a matter of picking the right time and place to *do* something

       Once again...nothing is known.  Some folks at WB when we got
renewed said there'd be five, some said four; come of the cast heard
four, and repeated four...the interviews you're seeing now were
actually done a long time ago, given lead times.

       If you're confused, it's because there IS no answer at this
time.  As I said last year at this time, and the year before at this
time, and the year before that...nothing is ever known at this point
until around February or a bit later.  They've initiated some
discussions about the fifth year, as the ratings have continued to
improve, but nothing is set either way.

       If I knew, for certain, I would tell you.  But I can't tell you
until WB makes its final decision.  That hasn't happened yet.

                                                                  jms

       Bear in mind that the White Stars are partially based on Vorlon
technology, which is similar in strength to the Shadows.  That helps a
lot. Also, other ships can have an influence in sufficient numbers. 
Even a lion can be brought down by a sufficient number of hyenas.  The
idea that higher technology always equals victory didn't help Custer.

      Just a little thought in your general direction....

      After spending all Monday doing the audio mix mix on 404,
"Falling Toward Apotheosis," which is normal, we did all but 7 minutes
of that episode.

      George Johnsen, John Copeland and I spent from about 7 p.m.
Wednesday night until 2:30 a.m. Thursday morning doing the audio mix on
those little seven minutes.

      So for that episode, you may want to make friends with somebody
with a really good surround sound system.

      No, that's the funny thing...I've seen a number of posts about
how his uniform was changed, but it *wasn't*.  It was exactly the same
outfit right out of the wardrobe closet...not sewn, not cleaned, just
dusted off a bit, by hand, the way he might've upon coming in.  You can
clearly see that the sleeve is still torn as he's up there.

      All I can figure is that the red Z'ha'dum lighting made it look
a lot worse than it was.

just as one may travel to countries that the US does not recognize
officially or have diplomatic relations with.  How long they continue
to allow this...we'll see.

Subject: Apologies on CO

      Very quickly...my apologies for the fiasco on thestation.com
tonight. Our server is directnet, and...okay, you accept that at
conventions, they always underestimate us.  They give us too small a
room.  Then our people show up...and it's madness.  Well, same thing
happened here.

      Their conferences run maybe 100 people tops most days, and
that's what they figured here *without asking us*.

      Their memory and system allocations were therefore in that area.

      Just one teensy, weensy little problem: something in excess of
2,000 people showed up.

      And I and others got frozen out of the system, the thing was
delayed 30 minutes, it was chaos, angry phone calls were made from B5
to directnet that fried phone lines....

      Anyway...my apologies to those who showed up and may have been
disappointed.  We've registered our extreme displeasure with
directnet, and are strongly considering changing servers because of
this.

                                                                  jms

apologizings.  The server, DirectNet, was blown out by 2,000 or so hits
at the same time, and they (stupidly) hadn't been prepared to face that
many when they approached us and told us we could do this.  I'm
*extremely* annoyed at this, and we're going to take some serious steps
to correct this and make sure it never, ever, EVER happens again.

       It's an efficient way of lighting an underground city several
miles across; you can open or close it to allow the big vessels in for
construction purposes, and so on.  If you build something that big, you
need some way of getting stuff IN there, then lighting it without
consuming vast amounts of energy.

       No, it was just relief, letting her guard down, allowing
herself to feel, which she hadn't done much before this.  There's no
romantic interest there.  You can have situations where men and women
work together, and can care about one another, without it turning into
more than that.

       Men seem to understand this less often than women.

       Remember, though, that the alien healing device isn't a
cure-all; to save one person's life, it takes the equal life force of
another.  It was used as a capital punishment device.  So somebody'd
have to die for that to happen...and even then, it doesn't cure
everything.

      Just an advisory: this Thanksgiving Sunday, there will be a 2
hour B5 presentation at LosCon, the annual fan-run convention put on by
LASFS (usual attendence about 1000).  The presentation/panel is slated
for 2:30-4:30 in the biggest room they have.  I'll do the first hour,
then the second hour will have our conceptual consultant Harlan
Ellison, producer John Copeland, and co-producer George Johnsen joining
in.  (There's a possibility Peter Jurasik may show up, but that's
unconfirmed at this point.)

      We'll have the very first showing of the rough cut of season 4
bloopers, scenes from several unaired episodes, a music video or two,
and of course the usual dog-and-pony show that has become the biggest
draw at each year's LosCon.

      Because this tends to be a big event, you may want to be sure to
show up a bit early, to get a seat...they vanish REAL fast.

      The convention is taking place at the Burbank Airport Hilton,
just abaft from the Burbank Airport, natch.

      LosCon, as a fan convention, is a lot of fun, and there's
generally a lot of good stuff going on all 3 days as well.  If you
haven't been to a con before, this is a good one on which to cut your
teeth.

      Morden is living in denial...he's afraid, and hoping he's right.
Centauri Prime has more civilians than any other planet or colony hit
so far: three billion people.  The shadows are hoping a figure that
high will daunt even the Vorlons.

      The wings are just how we perceived them, to some extent, though
we did see a hint of wings as the last of Kosh emerged from Sheridan. 
(We also heard the wing flap sound, and the sound of Kosh's voice for
the last time right after Lorien's "Now.")

      Dr. Kyle saw the angelic form...even in its reduced state, it
held itself together enough to maintain that form.

      I see the episode in my mind the same way it's seen by viewers. 
I watch it from the camera's point of view.  It's just once in a while,
as I'm watching it, that one of the characters will lean into camera,

to be terrible, or there wouldn't BE any efx...trying to poison the

improvement, and the new season shows that.

      Nope.  Because a) WB doesn't think there's a market for B5 on
tape or disk, b) won't let us do it because they have the right to do
it, even though they won't (like the proverbial monkey with its fist
around a nut in a jar, it can't take it out and won't let go), and c)
WB video almost never handles piddly TV stuff, only big-budget,
sure-return movies.

interest, and Cartagia is always responsive to what's best for
Cartagia.

      Thanks...those kinds of images are what we live for.

      Actually, the first few used about the same amount of stock as
most of our shows ever did.  And there was a LOT of new stuff...the
Z'ha'dum confrontation with the White Star, the new establishers of
Centuari Prime from space, plus the new ones of the city, and the big
garden areas in "The Summoning" (all those outside sets are virtual),
the shadow overflys in 401, Lorien's "true image" holding up Sheridan,
the underground Z'ha'dum composites, the new B5 establishers, the White
Star fleet coming to B5...there was a LOT of stuff there, it's just
very subtle.

      At this point, I'll likely be in Chicago.

> Are the effects the same or different in some respects?

      Basically, if you're told to look for a difference, you'll see
one.  I got a couple of emails saying that a couple of specific
Centauri Prime shots weren't as good as the old ones...then pointed out
that the ones they singled out WERE the old ones.

      As for the Planet Killer, we bring it a little closer each time.

      Virtually all the designs are right out of the computer files,
so they're identical to what's been done before, using the same system
(or slightly better) and most of the same people.

      Who is the greater foe?

      It is always the one closest to where you live.

      Actually, she said, "I think, it's possible, someone else does."
But she didn't specify Sheridan, and likely wouldn't have until she
knew absolutely for certain...and until she knew a little more about
the vorlon she was dealing with.

      Nope, it's the corret eye.  We don't make those kinds of

      Of course, at the moment, the vorlons are a little busy...but
given time, yes, they would do exactly that.
