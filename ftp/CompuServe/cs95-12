      I'm not sure I presented it positively; I just presented it, didn't make
a moral judgement about it.  Some of those in the show did, but then we had
Edward saying it *isn't* moral, that it's a monstrous thing to do.  Like any
form of punishment it can seem fair to those not facing it.

      I need a little help here from US netters, 'cause something strikes me as

time given here is DIFFERENT FROM the time it actually plays in your area.
(This seems especially curious to me since the report shows WTTY Indianapolis

dropped the show until WNDY picked it up.)

      No, the other brothers aren't mind-wiped.

      You're mis-remembering "The Quality of Mercy."  Telepaths do NOT
perform mindwipes.  A court appointed teep makes a scan before and after
for purposes of comparison, but the wipe is done by a device held under
lock and key until ordered out by a court.  The only reason Talia did it
in QoM was because they couldn't get a court teep there in the required
time (which was also stated in the episode).  So here the court appointed
telepath would have come and gone by now.

<Why did it take so long for a med team to get to Edward?>

      They were in a pretty distant part of DownBelow, and in B5 you don't
have trains or cars; there's just the transport tubes, and the central
core shuttle.  Even if they gave a damn about what happens to lurkers in
DownBelow (and they generally don't), it would still take at least 5-10
minutes to get a trauma team down there, and he was dead within about 3. 
(I was once mugged half a mile from a police station and a mile from a
hospital; took 'em 30 minutes to get there.)

     Sheridan and Theo didn't *discover* that Edward was using the
computer; Theo was concerned that he was looking into it in general.  And
if they had blocked the computer in his quarters, he would have been able
to access one somewhere else.  They didn't know he'd actually done it
until after the fact.

      One caveat here overall...it's been complimented and commented upon
that I  would expose a belief system in my show which I do not personally
agree with  (presenting the face of religion even though I'm an atheist).
That I could be this  tolerant is apparently praiseworthy.

      I would just suggest that at some point, when and if I should offer
a point of  view from another perspective, which one watching might not
personally agree  with, the same tolerance is given, since the virtue of
tolerating divergent attitudes  has been deemed praiseworthy...and is
something ever to strive for....

"The themes of faith and forgiveness were worthy of a theologian. Are you
sure  there isn't something you'd like to tell us?"

     Never shoot pool at a place called Pop's.  Never eat food at a place
called  Mom's.  The difference between horses and humans is that they're
too smart to be on what *we'll* do.

     And I have lost people.  Too many people.  Lost them to chance,
violence,  brutality beyond belief; I've seen all the senseless, ignoble
acts of "god's noblest  creature."  And I am incapable of forgiving.  My
feelings are with G'Kar, hand  sliced open, saying of the drops of blood
flowing from that open wound, "How do  you apologize to them?"  "I can't." 
"Then I cannot forgive."

     As an atheist, I believe that all life is unspeakably precious,
because it's only  here for a brief moment, a flare against the dark, and
then it's gone forever.  No  afterlives, no second chances, no backsies. 
So there can be nothing crueler  than the abuse, destruction or wanton
taking of a life. It is a crime no less than  burning the Mona Lisa, for
there is always just one of each.

     So I cannot forgive.  Which makes the notion of writing a character
who CAN  forgive momentarily attractive...because it allows me to explore
in great detail  something of which I am utterly incapable.  I cannot fly,
so I would write of birds  and starships and kites; I cannot play an
instrument, so I would write of  composers and dancers; and I cannot
forgive, so I would write of priests and  monks and minbari....

     On one level, I'm in favor of the death penalty.  I think that if
someone takes  your life deliberately, they sacrifice their own in return.
Some might say it's not a  deterrent in general...but it sure as heck
deters that specific person.

     *On the other hand*...I take that position mainly because nowadays,
when  someone is sentenced to life, "life" means about 15 years at best. 
If life  imprisonment MEANT life inprisonment, then I'd happily go for
that option above  the death penalty (and that certainly does leave room
for verdict corrections).

atone for the sins of others;  when he sees Theo later, through the grate,

      Yes, B5 has a court system, authorized by the Earth Alliance

     So the soul form in Minbari is different from the soul form in

      {regarding athiest vs. agnostic}

      If all the things you describe were suddenly to happen, sure, I'd
have to give  my position serious thought, while turning down Stephen
Hawking's invitations  to dance and dodging the newly revived dead.  Now,
when is this supposed to  happen?  'Cause it hasn't happened yet, and
gives no indication of happening  anytime soon.  Which is, really, the
point.

      Let me try a different take on this whole agnostic/atheist thing, to
see if I can  better communicate my position.  My agent calls and says,
"Listen, the BBC  called, and they're interested in signing you up for a
two year documentary on the  mating habits of clams."  To which I respond,
"Great, but I'll believe it when it  happens."

      I do not say that the contract may, or may not exist; it either is,
or it isn't, and  my actions proceed from those two options.  Until I get
the contract actually in my  hand, it doesn't exist.  Until someone puts
the absolute proof out in front of me of  a deity, it doesn't exist. 
That's the difference; the agnostic says, well, maybe  there is, maybe
there isn't, who knows?  The atheist says, There is currently no  proof
whatsoever of this assertion, thus I choose not to believe it.

      There are, really, any number of schools on what atheism is or
isn't. Some  have taken this to be the notion of anti-religion, which I
think is unconstructive.  I  used to write a humor column for Madeline
Murry O'Hare's publication American Atheist back in the 1970s (betcha
didn't know that one, did you?).  Even did some  other writing, articles
and the like...until one day I realized that this (American  Atheist
Organization) wasn't about just providing equal respect and treatment for 
atheists, it was about knocking down religion and attacking others' belief
systems...at which time I resigned the magazine.

      To get back on track...mine is the kind of atheism you saw most
often around  the turn of the century, basically accommodational of
others, positive in outlook,  stressing the basic worth of the individual,
and the importance of the individual in  building a better society.

      Because of the more...rigorous atheists out there, atheism has, I
think, gotten  kind of a bad rap in some circles.  And a lot of it is
unfair, though I'd be foolish to  say that the criticisms were entirely
without merit.  But when then-President Bush  said, as he did in an
interview in Chicago during the last election, that he  "doesn't really
consider atheists patriots, since after all the idea is one nation  under
god," it brings you up a little short.  The founders of this country
weren't just  believers, they were deists and freethinkers and even the
occasional atheist.

      In any event...I hadn't meant to belabor the point.  This is simply
what I think.  I  don't usually get into it, but the question was raised,
so I answered it.  I don't  expect much of anyone else to agree, or to
convince anyone to think as I do.  And  that's fine, and as it should be.

     We're making 22 episodes this year; interestingly enough,
because the  ratings have been doing quite well, there have
been some informal talks initiated  by some folks at PTEN
about us doing an additional 2 hours in the form of a  direct-

So in that  sense we'd be doing 24 this season.  It's not
finalized, but we're very encouraged  that they're considering
trying this with us.  We won't have any final disposition on 
this until well after Christmas, however.  The problem will be
in getting all the  pertinent WB divisions to work together on
this with us, and working with PTEN in  the sense that it
won't be aired initially until much later, which may be a 
stumbling block...but we'll see.  Still, it's a great vote of

     Yes, he had the momentum from his jump, plus that of the
core shuttle itself  (which is considerable), plus the wind
currents toward the center of the station  area/garden, which
area also considerable.  Together that would be enough to 
keep him moving toward the outer edge of the garden area.

     No, the Narns do not have artificial gravity, which is

      Yes, long-distance com systems like StellarCom are

      {regarding not enough time...}

      Except, of course, there's no need to transport steel
and other materials from  Earth...if that's your premise then
it's seriously flawed. You mine ore from the  surrounding
asteroids, as NASA has described for some time could be done. 
 You could assemble the shell off Earth in pieces fairly
quickly, use the jump gate  to get it to Epsilon Eridani, and
mine whatever else you need there in the area  fairly effi-
ciently.

      Bear in mind that building a station like this in 2260
uses many of the same  techniques already being used else
where...so in many cases it's a matter of  slightly converting
what's already being mass produced for other reasons.  
Explorer vessels like the Cortez, for instance, are nearly as
long as Babylon 5 (as  seen in "A Distant Star"), and its
rotating section is nearly as wide.  And you've  got other big
ships, many with rotational areas for gravity-positive
sections.  This  isn't like NASA gearing up to make a one-off
of something; this is a matter of  adjusting technology
already in use.

      To get at the files, you have to follow these steps: use
the Install part of the  setup menu, which takes you to the
CDrom.  Highlight the files in the Images  directory.  Then
copy them into the correct directory on your hard drive.  Once
that's done, you then select the images you want.  Also be
sure that the image  categories are toggled on your setup menu
(personal info, battle info, images  (all vs. selected) and so
on.

     I've found that every once in a while, a video piece will
bump into my system.   What's weird is that I have two
identical systems, one at the work office, one at  home...on
the work office system, every single image works without
problem.  At  home, one of the images bumps into windows and
shuts me down.

     The best way to find out which is doing this is to
individuall select the areas  (i.e., first select just Battle
Info, or Geological Info, and de-select all the others in  the
setup menu).  Let those run through, and if there's not a
problem, try the next  one.  Since they go in order, you can
figure out pretty fast which one is causing  you a problem. 
I did this, and now my system at home works fine, after
omitting  one of the ship info files that, again, runs just
fine on the work system.

"I agree it is rediculous but JMS reported it at a Comic
conference somewhere  and I was giving what I consider good
advice to all who wish to do something  positive in lieu of
his negative comment. Read previous messages about the 
cancellation rumor so you can direct your anger to the proper
sources. I did not  start this and I will not speak further on
this rumor because it is exactly what JMS  wants. He loves for
us to argue among ourselves. Be careful, he may be reading 
and enjoying this right now!"

       Excuse me just one damned minute here.  I just found
out about this thread,  and once again this is being totally
and 100% distorted by you.

       I have never, ever, at any time posted a rumor saying
"Hey, DS9 is going to  be canceled."  If you can find it, and
post it, I will resign from Compuserve  *instantly* and
*permanently*.  But you won't, because it doesn't exist.  What
you,  and a few others, do is take what *was* said, throw it
out there to cause a  firestorm, which gets me in trouble.

       What I said was this: that at the time all this took
place, several months ago,  there were several articles
published -- in TV Guide, in the Los Angeles Times,  elsewhere
quoting people like Kerry McCluggage, the head of Paramount,
who  was concerned that having two ST shows around was cutting
into the potential  viewers for Voyager.  Even one of the exec
producers over at ST commented, in  the LA Times article, that
they may have gone to the well once too often.

       At the same time as this, there was a rumor floating
around town, which is  *still* floating around, that Paramount
was concerned about the notion of two  shows splitting the
potential ST audience...an audience that is necessary to 
Voyager as the cornerstone for the Paramount Network, UPN.
There's much to  be said for canceling one show, DS9, so that
there's only one place to go if you  want to see Star
Trek...Voyager.  Because Paramount has *millions* of dollars 
more invested in their network than in the standard syndica
tion deal for DS9.

       The *possibility* was being discussed, came the word on
the street. And  several other people in the industry, who
work in post production and sound  editing at the other
studios around town, came forth and supported this by saying 
they'd heard much the same.  But it's only woolgathering,
nothing more, and I  never said it WAS anything more than
that.  But a few people like you and a  couple of others have
taken that one message, which I posted only once, here,  not
some "comics conference," and crossposted it to other forums,
paraphrased  it, distorted it, and changed it around in order
to make it look like I posted a rumor  that I *never* in fact
posted, for the simple purpose of causing me grief.

       While there's much to commend this electronic forum,
what's *wrong* with it  at root is that people can come in
here, post something like this as if it's true,  and then you
have to respond to it and chase it down.

       Knowing folks here, I'm sure *somebody* has my original
post filed away  somewhere.  I'm happy to see that reposted,
because it is exactly as I have  characterized it.

       Look, I get in enough trouble for the things I *really*
say without other people  putting words in my mouth and
deliberately distorting it.

       I have never, ever, at any time, said that DS9 was
going to be canceled, or  that there was a rumor on the
streets that DS9 was going to be canceled.  Never  happened. 
Are we clear on this now?

     Speaking of TPTB, here's an interesting angle on the
whole Voyager/DS9 dynamic.

     Recently, more and more, the ST execs (people like Berman
and Pillar) have been commenting publicly about the factional
ization of the SF TV marketplace, and how this has diminished
the numbers for the ST shows overall.  Most interestingly, one
of them commented in an LA Times article this past week that
a big problem for them is the factionalization *within*
ST...that people may only have time to watch one version of ST
 that week, and they're being forced to choose.  And, of
course, there are the debates between the two sides on
quality.

     Which dovetails precisely into the rumor running around
town that Paramount is considering giving the axe to DS9 after
this season, in order to force folks who want their ST to
watch Voyager...because they have more money invested right
now in Voyager, particularly in start-up, and they have their
hopes for the Paramount network pinned to Voyager as their
center. They don't like the idea of a syndicated show out
there causing problems for the network on which they've spent
millions and millions of dollars.  And DS9's ratings have been
steadily on the decrease since the debut.  So the logic goes:
take away DS9, and make those who want Trek go to Voyager as
the sole provider of that.

     Given the sources from whom this has come, I give very
high credibility to the notion that this *is* being discussed;
whether or not it will be implemented, that only time will
tell.  If Voyager continues to decrease, threatening the
foundations of Paramount's bid for a network, I'd think the
chances of this happening will continue to rise.

     THANK you.  As the message said, the topic *was* being
discussed, but that  there was no indication as to whether or
not that step would eventually be  implemented.  And others
confirmed this.  Nowhere in that message was it  stated by me
that the show *is* going to be canceled, or that I'd heard
anyone  else say that it was going to be canceled.

     With luck, this will finally put an end to the distor
tions that get around, thanks  to some people who want to fuel
online wars.

     Thanks again for digging this out.

From:  J. Michael Straczynski       #419339

      {regarding why Paramount doesn't move DS9 to UPN}

     I don't know for certain, but I'd suspect that there are
contractual elements  prohibiting this.  UPN is an alliance
between Paramount and Chris Craft  Television; at this point,
CCT is paying virtually all the money for developing and 
airing the shows, with Paramount contractually able to buy 50%
of the network  sometime in the next year or so.  (This per
the trades and reports in industry  business journals.)

     DS9 is currently owned exclusively by Paramount.  Many of
the stations that  currently air DS9 are not necessarily part
of the UPN network; some are Tribune  stations, or other
independents.  If they made it part of UPN, they would then 
have to shuffle around a lot of stations, and might end up
losing better time slots  and it's a *lot* of hassle.  And
Paramount would have to be willing to turn over  partial
ownership of DS9 to Chris Craft (here I'm guessing), and they
may not  want to do that, may possibly not be *able* to do so
by contract.

     It's a very confusing corporate web, not that unlike the
situation which basically  prevents B5 from going to the WB
network.

Ivanova.  It had never in fact been intended  for her, but

     All the characters are unique; there seems to be this

Ivanova's just Takashima renamed," or "Sheridan's  story is
just the same as Sinclair's, same guy just renamed."  They're
*not* and  never have been.  The story of one does not devlove
automatically upon the  other.  If you make a change, it's
because you have something better in  mind...otherwise why
make it?

      >If Laurel had stayed on the show, would she have

      >would then have taken over as second in command? 

     If Laurel *had* stayed with the show, by the middle of
year two the fact that she  was Control would've been revealed
via the password incident. At that point, one  particular
possibility was that her second in command under her -- a
rather dour  Russian lieutenant named Ivanova -- would've been
promoted to take her place,  while Laurel was moved off the
chessboard. (This was planned because we  knew going in that
Tamlyn Tomita had a growing film career, and we probably 
could've only kept her for a couple of years in the best of
circumstances.  So why  not turn that to your advantage?)

     The position now being occupied by Corwin, Ivanova's
second, is the position  that Ivanova would've held (though
more prominently) if Laurel had stayed on.   (And no, Corwin
doesn't now have that arc lurking in the background.)

     See, it's easy to stick to an outline and never diverge
if you're writing  characters in a novel; in a TV show, with
live actors, you have to be flexible, plan  ahead, come up
with contingency plans, and have threads that weave and 
interlock in ways to leave you maximum flexibility while still
proceeding toward  your destination.

From:  J. Michael Straczynski       #418142

       Jeez...where do I even start with that one...?

       Okay, "how would I evaluate the work that I've done on
the series to this  point."  (I assume this refers to the
scriptwriting part of my duties, rather than the  producing
part.)

       The first season, I think, was pretty fair.  There were
some rough spots here  and there.  There's a thing known to
athletes called getting "in the zone," that's  when you're
absolutely on target, in the groove, whatever jargon you wish
to throw in.  In any first season of a show, no matter howmuch
advance planning  has gone into the thing, there's a shakedown
period as you find out what really  *does* and doesn't work. 
There was a fair amount of that in year one.

       I think I only really popped into the "zone" a few
times, with the first real such  experience being "And the Sky
Full of Stars."  Once I hit it, I was able to find the  target
again a few more times that season, with "Mind War," "Babylon
Squared,"  "Chrysalis" and a couple of others.  But that was
about it.  I was trying to find a  new way of telling a story
for TV, and while I'd been thinking about it for a long  time,
there was never a chance to get in any *practice* because
except for  Power, which had a few arc aspects to it, no other
show WORKS like B5 in this  respect.  So there was still a
learning curve.

       Season two, I think, I started to Get It more often,
and more consistently.  I'd  learned a lot doing year one, and
was able to apply it. I don't think I could've  written "The
Coming of Shadows" in year one, I just hadn't yet acquired the
skills  that ONLY come through practice doing this very
unusual style of storytelling.  I  think I got into the zone
a little faster, with the last four in particular being right
on  the mark, for what I wanted to achieve.

       And as far as season three is concerned...though only
4 have aired, I'm  finishing #17 right now.  I usually gauge
where things are by the reaction the  scripts get around the
set...and this season, more than any other, I've had the 
actors and crew come by just shaking their heads in astonish-
ment at what's  coming down in the pages.  The folks at WB
have made it a point to call and say  that they're loving what
they're seeing in the scripts, and that's unusual.

       Subjectively -- and this opinion is the least valid,
since it's colored by my own  perception -- I think that at
this moment, I'm doing the best work of my career to  date. 
There's something happening in the scripts that...I can't
really define.   There's just something *there* that wasn't
there before, or was there only  sporadically.  The scripts
are completely taking on a life of their own.  (I related 
elsewhere that something very major happened in "Interludes
and Examinations," #15, that was never, ever in the arc, that
I hadn't planned on doing  when I began the script...but the
damned thing just *happened*...and all I could  do was watch
it unfold on the page.)

       Out of 17 to date, the only one that's *slightly*
clunky is "Exogenesis,"  because it's just a little too
straightforward for my tastes. I'd thought it was going  to be
something other than what it was; there's a writing phrase,
"it's too much  what it is."  But it has some great character
moments in it, and I think that  redeems it to some extent.

       But that's it, that's the only one.  "Messages From
Earth" may be, in my view,  the best thing we've ever done. 
And the rest are just nifty.  I'm pleased and proud  and
utterly astonished at how well some of this stuff has come out
this season.

       (I *suspect* that part of the reason for the improve-
ment this season is that  I'm not outlining each episode as
much as before.  I used to sit down and break  out each act in
detail, and then stick pretty strongly to that outline.  Now
I just sit  down, knowing where I have to go with the story,
and write it straight through,  letting the characters take
control from time to time.  It takes a long time to be  able
to trust yourself, your ability, and your characters before
you can do that in a  show; finally I'm there.)

       "what directions do you see the series going in now,
that you might not have  considered back when you first
started?"

       Well, it's hard to say, in large measure because of
what I've reported in the  paragraphs preceding.  The series
has taken on a life of its own now, and while I  know where
it's going, from time to time this great big unweildy beast
throws me  off and goes where it wants.  And I'd be a fool if
I refused to listen to that, and  forced it to comply with
what I'd come up with in 1987.  Because that's the key 
thing that I've come to understand. The structure was written
in 1987/88...and I'm  a much better writer now than I was
then.  I still intend to reach the destination I'd  imagined,
but I've found FAR more interesting ways to get there than I
could've  imagined then. Remember, since 1987 I worked on the
Twilight Zone, Nightmare Classics, Murder She Wrote...I've
learned a lot of stuff and acquired  some tools I didn't have
back then.

       So long answer made short...I think that the main
difference is that the rest of  the story is going to be more
ambitious, more dramatic, more fundamentally  *interesting*
than I had ever hoped for.  And given what was there before,
that's  saying a lot.

     Actually, Mike Vejar is directing the two-parter, and I'm
absolutely thrilled about  it; Mike's been our mainstay for
some time, and he's just terrific.  (He directed  "Convic-
tions," and "Inquisitor.")

       Adam was great in that he's a *very* serious director
who sits down and  really thinks through the subtext of the
episode, the thematic aspects, the  underlying symbology, and
then sits with the actor and *really* works with them  so that
they fully understand the nuances of the scene.  A lot of TV
direction can  be rushed...you're always under the gun...so
it's rare to find someone who really  takes his time and
prepares the cast.

       "Does the pressure come from within, or does it come
from without and the  reaction of the fans of the series?"

       From within.  There's nothing I've ever seen on any net
that's half as critical of  this show as what's said by we who
make it.  If you try to gauge a show, any  show, and determine
its direction by viewer reactions, you're going to have 
pudding, because there are too many divergent reactions.  It
becomes one  massive committee...and committees are the death
of any creative process.

       I'm making this show, first and foremost, for myself,
on the theory that what I  find interesting, others may also
find of interest.  And I'm a perfectionist.  Also a  pain in
the ass.  Also monomanaical.  Just getting a show this big,
this involved,  this visually complex *made* is a task of
Herculean proportions...let alone  getting it made *well*.

       I've always been a very driven personality; I try never
to settle for second best.   If it can't be done just a little
better than what we did last week, why the hell are  we doing
it?  There *has* to be constant evolution, constant growth,
constant  challenge, or you're dead creatively.  You've got to
be absolutely willing to knock  all your support pins out from
under you, in the belief that your skills will enable  you to
land somewhere interesting on your feet.  The moment you
*stop* taking  that risk...you're finished.  At least, that's
what I feel about it.

       This show is probably my one real chance to leave a
mark that I passed this  way, so it has to be as good as I can
humanly make it.  And nothign will ever get  in the way of
that.

     Stims are a prescription drug, which makes it perfect
fodder for abuse by  doctors (which includes Drs Rosen and
Franklin).  And yes, Franklin has been  getting increasingly
cranky of late for reasons related to stims.

  To:  The Jawa / Jawa        December 19, 1995 11:05:19 PM
From:  J. Michael Straczynski       #418808

      {regarding suggestions for Jawa's novel}

       Technical: if someone who knows scientific stuff said
"this character can't do  this because it's technically
impossible," I'd have to really consider it, if he could  give
me a good enough argument.  (And even there you have wiggle
room...what  we *think* is impossible now may not be in 200
years.  Serious scientists years  ago said that if you went
more than 60 miles an hour in a train or a car you'd be 
killed by the pressure.  So as long as you can make a plaus-
ible argument that  it's *possible,* even if it's highly
unlikely, you can sometimes get away with  rubber science.) 
If it's a big glaring issue, or in the present where you don't
have  alternate options, you may be stuck hewing to it.  If
the person suggested an  alternative, and that alternative
worked, and kept the science valid, sure, I'd take  it. That's
what a consultant is for.  As long as it doesn't compromise
the integrity  of the story.

       Who reads: Yes, do be careful in your selection.  Some
people will tell you  how to write it "better," when they
really mean "write it more like *I* would've  written it."  A
really bad reaction to what you've written, from someone you
like or  admire, can be an absolute soul-killer.  And they may
not be right.  May, in fact, be  quite wrong.  What you also
have to remember is what every writer learns: if you  put your
work out there, and you ASK for an opinion, suddenly they feel
that they  *must have* an opinion, and they *must find*
flaws...so instantly that tends to  skew things toward more
negative comments than might be the case if they just  picked
the book up off a store shelf and read it.  If you can find an
adult *writer* to  look at it, you may consider that...but to
go to non-writers for technical advice or  reactions or
suggestions on writing is often non-constructive.  Their
reaction to  the material may be valid, but they may not have
the language or know the writing  craft well enough to steer
you in the right direction, and may only succeed in  muddying
up the waters.  If I were working to be a draftsman, and 
finished my  first big design, I'd probably show it to another
draftsman before I showed it to my  Aunt Morgana la Fey.

       Whoever you turn to for advice, always remember that
that advice must  always be secondary to what the small, still
voice of the writer inside you insists  is correct.  You have
to find your own voice, and if that means not taking the other
person's suggestions, then that's what you have to do. Either
you'll be right, or  you'll be wrong, and you'll hear the same
comment from dozens of others, or  those in the field, and
then you may have to reconsider your position.  But initially, 
follow your voice.

       Magazine sales: no, your story can definitely be
published elsewhere  UNLESS the magazine specifically indi-
cates that it buys "all rights." Otherwise, it  will usually
buy other rights.  First North American rights are the most
common,  leaving you free to sell it to other magazines
overseas, and to other magazines in  the US after a reasonable
period has passed, or if it's to a non-competing  magazine. 
It's pretty much unheard of these days for magazines to buy
all rights.   (Suggestion: go to your local library and pick
up a copy of WRITER'S MARKET,  published yearly by Writer's
Digest Books.  They generally explain the various  rights you
sell in such situations.)

     Yes, one thing we've been discussing with the friendly
folks at WB is licensing  the videos via the fan club as
limited editions.  I don't know how limited "limited"  is yet,
it kinda depends on our resources.  It may just be a few
thousand each as  we gear up.  (And while we've been told we
*can* make the deal, we haven't yet  geared up the paperwork,
as we've been waiting for the fan club paperwork to  come in
first.)  I'll certainly recommend 2 eps per tape when we do
it; any more  than that, and you go to 160 minute tape, which
is thinner, and breaks and  stretches more easily than 120
tapes.

     (We won't be able to do widescreen until WB authorizes
the re-telecineing of  the original negative film stock back
to its initial aspect ratio, and releases the  funds to do
that, which are considerable.)

     Regarding "Legacies," there's one brief blip in there

     What does the learning curve tell me these days?  That

     Re: season 3 scripts...I'm quite happy with them, and the
finished episodes.   I'd put on the top of the list for this

Of No Return, Severed Dreams, Voices of Authority, Passing 
Through Gethsemane, A Late Delivery From Avalon, Dust To Dust,

may try and gear up to hold an official B5  convention in
about a year.  What we've talked about is the idea of having
it here  in LA, so we could have best chance of getting as
many cast members as  possible.  We'd also try and run it so
that it was as close as possible to a fan-run  convention in
the feeling it created; and as well as cast members and the

in prosthetics,  wardrobe, makeup, art direction, props and

     That's the key, I think; I have a suspicion that, like
the original ST, our main  attention will likely come after
we've finished our complete run. The show was  designed to be
seen in a stripped (once daily) fashion, that's when you
really can  see the arc moving quickly.  And on TNT, once it
hits that distributer, it'll finally  have what it has never
had before in this country: a national broadcaster and a

     Actually, what you'll generally find is that if you watch
a few more eps, the  background is usually included.  Besides,
in the next batch of new episodes, we  kind of redefine the
very nature of the series, so in a way this is the best time
to  come aboard.

     I think it'll be spring, not mid-1996; also, remember
that they don't break up the  show with reruns, they air
straight through, and the episodes have to be  *finished* in
time for them to air them straight through (and I think WB is
trying to  avoid the problem last time of stuff airing in the
UK first).  But as yet I haven't  heard a final date on this.

Then B13 gave the order to  eliminate.  Nowhere does it say
that Control said the second half of the  sentence.

From:  J. Michael Straczynski       #423904

     Actually, from my perspective, it was never intended as
a shot at Christians at  all; it was a warning shot to any
breed of fanaticism that does not question itself,  that
assumes, for whatever reason, that it is right and must impose
that  rightness on others, no matter the price (usually paid
by others).  To quote a line  from "Infection," "When you
become obsessed with the enemy, you *become*  the enemy."  So
I guess you could describe it as a shot at Christianity only
if you  choose to define it in those terms; if not, then it's
not.

     Certainly, though, it does point to being sure that one
is doing what one is  doing for the right reasons, and the sin
of pride, which we all know has a  tendency to goeth before a
fall.

     For me, one of the important things about this show is to
make people *think*  about what they believe.  If they come
right back to what they originally believed,  that's fine. 
But they've *considered why* they believe it.  In all too many
cases,  our beliefs -- social, political, religious -- are
just sort of *there*, invisible,  ineffable and unassailable,
as much a part of the universe as the air around us.   We
don't necessarily think WHY we believe it...we do.  Which is
why, all too often,  when someone is challenged on what they
believe, they don't have the tools to  defend it in any way
other than force or anger.  But if you *have* considered your 
beliefs, and you know why you feel a certain way, you can
articulate it, explain it,  and be more self-confident in it. 
It allows you to have discussions rathe than  arguments,
schisms, or border wars.

     Like I said, I don't have any answers...all I got are
some questions, but they're  pretty good questions.  Our
greatest peril is always the danger of the  unexamined life.

     Re: C.S. Lewis...yes, I've read his stuff, from the
Screwtape Letters (which are  great fun) to Perelandra and
That Hideous Strength and others, including some  of his
polemics and essays on christianity.  He was a good thinker
and a facile  writer...which was sometimes good, and sometimes
not so, because he had a  tendency to set up straw-man
arguments, which made for more persuasive  dogma but not
always reasonable discussion.

     And yes, I've read the bible cover to cover, twice.  Some
good moral tales, an  awful lot of blood and violence, some
real slow parts (anyone who can make it  all the way through
Numbers and Deuteronomy has my unbridled respect),  some real
potboilers, a few plot holes and an inconsistent hero, but
overall,  commendable reading.  (Though one could argue that
any number of later  writers did a better job of pure writing
than is present in the bible -- no  self-respecting writer
would stop the narrative so often for a few thousand begats 
and the discussion of cubits...well, except maybe for Herman
Mellville, who had  far too many asides on whaling technology
as parentheticals in Moby Dick...and  one should certainly
think that a deity would be at least a good a writer as 
Pynchon or Salinger or Joyce...still, there are spurts of
greatness; the book of Job  is possibly one of the best
stories ever written, and there's much in Psalms and  Proverbs
to commend itself to anyone...though best to keep the Song of 
Solomon out of the hands of kids...some racy stuff there....)
