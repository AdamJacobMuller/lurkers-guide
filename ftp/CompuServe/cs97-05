       I think that comics fans grow into SF fans, and from SF fans
come SF writers and (now) SF producers.  Genre domino theory.

      Just about ANY of Harlan's books are worth reading, though
Strange Wine and Shatterday (available at most SF stores) are personal
favorites, and his latest Edgeworks volume just came out.

      Sci-Fi vs. SF...the former is flash-n-dazzle, monsters eating
people, ID4, lots of action and not much thought.  SF is Blade Runner,
the first Alien movie, The Day the Earth Stood Still, Seconds, Charley,
others. Science Fiction means it examines the impact of technology on
people, or in some way extrapolates to the future in new and
interesting or innovative ways.

something close to SF, collapsed shortly thereafter into just plain
awfulness.  The idea of advanced prosthetics incorporated into a living
human is an interesting idea...but frittered away here.

      The issue of waste of bandwith is not as big a deal to an
advanced technology (from today's standards); also, any really good
telepath could rip out those codes and keys in about 10 seconds. 
Further, they would've had a password to use (as in "the board," which
he used) to verify that he was all right and not being forced to make
the call.

      I think that the thing has gone downhill ever since they redid
them a few years ago.  They've kind of gone back to the roots of the
book, but now it seems to be getting a bit silly, and the names of the
characters have gotten changed, and it's gotten dopey.

      Ah, well...for me, Superman died with the Alan Moore two-parter
(now on sale as a graphic novel, "Whatever Happened to the Man of
Tomorrow?")  That, for my money, was the best thing DC did with the
character in decades.  I don't know who the new guy is....

      I haven't done that much comics reading lately; I've been a fan
since the early 60s/late 50s, as soon as I learned how to read.  Mainly
DC stuff. The market's gone to hell over the last year or two, so I've
kinda lost interest.

       Re: the cartoon...I'm a big WB cartoon fan, and knew that one
very well, and there were two places where it would've fit with the
story; the other one, which I almost used, was when you see two Daffy's
arguing with each other.

       Re: the CGI...we've been fairly conventional with the CGI in
recent seasons, we're trying to get a bit more adventurous.

       The Lise flashback material is all exactly as was filmed for
"Babylon Squared."  I think we used a few more pieces of the original
footage, but it was all stet.

       Re: Delenn...these episodes happen close to one another in
time, so you have to allow travel time for her to get to Minbar.

       Re: Lise...well, everybody can't be a fighter; we've had guys
and the occasional female character who isn't used to being shot at.  I
daresay I'm not terribly used to being shot at, and someone who's
mainly a civilian would probably react about that same way.  It's just
a matter of showing that diversity realistically rather than saying,
"Okay, let's have a helpless female now."  Having every female (or
male) hard-nosed and laughing off PPG bursts is as unrealistic as its
opposite.

      As she states in the episode, they were at that time
*surrounded* and if they turned to fire, would get destroyed. 
Firepower doesn't solve every problem; one good hand-held Lancet
missile can put down a full-sized cruiser if it hits right.  They were
in the MIDDLE of the Drakh, just as they said, and that's NOT a
defensible position.  They had to get away, outside that group, so they
could mount an offensive.  This they did.

      So re: Jenoff's comments...another example of a self-styled
critic who faults the show when the information is right there...the
problem is the perceiver, not the perceived.  I can't be held
responsible for critics not thinking through what's said right there on
camera.

       That's exactly what happens.  Happened to Peter David on Space
Cases; the nitwits at Nickelodeon came in and made a great number of
stupid changes, which only hurt the show...the ratings went down
because of those changes, and this led them to conclude the show just
didn't work (rather than admit the changes were stupid) and thus
canceled the show.

       Same thing happened on The Real Ghostbusters; we had the #1
rated animated show on the air at the time.  Then the Experts and the
Consultants came in to fix it.  Massive and stupid changes.  I could
either swallow them, or leave.  I left.  And the show went down the
toilet.  After that, they kinda came around and said that maybe the
changes were, sorta, kinda, wrong, see...and would I do a few more
freelance the way it was supposed to be and put it back?  There at
least they were sufficiently mensches to do the right thing, and be
open about it.  I have a great deal of respect for them as a result.

"I'm sincerely curious about how you found the experience of directing
your baby -- of being responsible for creating, writing, producing
*and* directing it."

      My main goal was not to embarrass myself overmuch.  I think I
came out okay.  I've now seen an editor's assembly of the material, and
it plays real nice.  Now I get to go in and make the director's cut,
which will to all intents and purposes also stand as the producer's
cut.

      The main thing is...this one is *exactly* the way I saw it in my
head. It has a somewhat different feel than prior episodes, though hard
to quantify. But I think it came out nicely.

"You have spent the last 4 years keeping your actors in the dark as to
their final fates (for the most part).  Will their knowledge of the
ending have adverse effects on the acting from this point forward?  I
expect the answer is they are good at their jobs and will continue to
be outstanding in their performances, but many of them have mentioned
that the lack of knowledge of their future had  played a part in their
performances."

      Not really, no more so than seeing G'Kar and Londo strangling
each other as early as year one...but we didn't know what that *meant*
until later.  And there's still a long, long way between that episode
and where we leave off at 421.  A lot happens there that nobody else
knows, inclusive of the cast.

"Also, if you've neatly tied everything up, what does that really
leave for season 5?  Filler, non-arc stories?  This has been my biggest
fear.  That season 5 will now be farmed out to other scriptwriters, who
don't have the intimacy with the story that you have, and that the
quality of stories will take a nose dive with filler material."

      Without giving too much away, season 5 would be empire building.
It wouldn't be filler at all, but a logical extension of what has gone
before.

      Basically...I often get messages from people worrying about what
might be...then they see what *is* and it's, "Oh...okay, got it." 
Generally speaking, I think it's better to react to what is rather than
what might never in fact be an issue.  I ain't let you down yet....

      Funny thing...was returning from Marcon and on the plane was me,
Tracy Torme (Sliders) and Bryce Zabel (Dark Skies).  I noted as we took
off that if the plane went down, the SFTV universe would be ceded to
Piller and Carter by default.

       Negative; season 5 would take place in 2262, 19 years before
the "final scene" you mention.  And no, I wouldn't want season 5 to be
just a setup for the sequel; it was sketched out long before that
became any kind of possibility, and I have no interest in doing that
sort of thing.  We'd do one or two small things, but no more than that.

      There are elements of the true seeker in many of our characters;
Sinclair for one, G'Kar certainly (now that he's been enlightened a
bit), and Sheridan didn't start out that way, but in his own stumbling
way has slowly begin growing into that.

{original post unavailable}

      You still don't seem to get it.

      Let me take off the kid gloves for a moment and explain it to
you.

      I work 20+ hours a day on B5.  You came on here and began
demanding I investigate claims made by a German convention.  I didn't
have time initially to get into it, and in response there was letter
after letter here demanding that I look into this, even though I had no
firsthand knowledge of the situation, and then more or less condemning
me for not getting personally involved in this.

      You (and others involved in this) continued emailing me and
posting public messages on this, and began emailing members of our
cast, our crew...becoming, frankly, a pain in the ass.  Email demands
for me to take a stand, to investigate, to proclaim something, began
showing up in more than one of my accounts, which are already flooded
with other requests.

      Finally, I had the chance to sit down with Bruce and a few other
actors (who were, at that time, already annoyed with the demands for
explanations put on them by yourself and several other German fans) and
said, "Are you going to this con?"  I then posted what they told me,
assuming that would be the end of it...and AGAIN you came at me for it.

      One reaches a point where one says, at last, "A pox on *both*
your houses."  Or, as the Brits say, "Bugger off."

      You have been rude to myself, and my cast, and several of my
staff. You have harrassed us with email and demands for our attention
and our involvement in something we have no direct involvement in.

      If a convention is advertising guests who in fact are not going
to appear, that is fraud.  Fraud is prosecutable under German laws.  If
they show up, then it's not fraud.  If they don't, then it is, and they
can be taken to court.  Our job is not to interfere with German
jurisprudence or make statements that could GET US SUED under German
law about people we do not know.

      If you want confirmation about whether or not a guest is coming,
you can find that out through the actor's agents or find means of doing
this other than harrassing me about it.

"We don't understand why this is such a big problem to him?"

      Because you're being a pain in the butt, *that's* why, and
making demands on us that we do things that a) we're not authorized to
do, b) don't have time to do, c) are best done in Germany, d) you and
others have been yelling in our ears and filling our email boxes and
making demands and carrying on cranky and throwing around accusations
of disinterest in the affairs of our fans now for at *least* three
months, and frankly neither I nor any of my cast or crew want to hear
it anymore.

      If you have a local problem, it should be *solved* locally,
through the means you have there at your disposal.  I am not your
lapdog to run around and take care of your errands and I am not going
to jump every time you make demands on my time.  We care *deeply* for
our fans, who are worldwide, and we do all we can to assist them.  We
have gone far beyond the call of duty in ways you will never know.  But
every once in a while, someone shows up who is obnoxious and demanding
and won't take "please go away" for an answer, and who by their rude
behavior gives all fans a bad name.

      Neither Babylon 5, nor Babylonian Productions, nor Warner Bros.
has any direct involvement in this or any other German convention.  Our
cast sign on as free agents, as individuals.  We do not, and will not,
get involved in any convention situation unless I *personally* have
direct knowledge of something involving a con which I will be
attending.  Not only would it be inappropriate, it would also be
impossible...our cast members are attending cons now in hundreds of
cities and many countries around the world.  I can't keep track of it
all, and shouldn't be expected to.  My cast members are grown adults,
and the fans in each area should pursue whatever local resources they 
have in determining a con's legitimacy.  The only way I get involved
directly in conventions is if I attend personally, or if we should
reach a point where Babylonian Productions endorses a convention, which
to date has not happened.

      My problem, in short, is not with the German fans.  It is
specifically and directly with *you* and a few others who have far, far
exceeded the limits of polite behavior, harrassed me, harrassed my
cast, and taken up space on this forum to no good end.  That was the
intent of my prior note.

      Resolve your local problems locally.

                                                                  jms

"Are tears a normal Minbari physical reaction, or is weeping (for
Delenn) one of the changes mandated by her chrysalitic"

      We've seen Delenn cry before, when she and G'Kar were in her
quarters and she was explining why she did not get involved in the
Narn/Centauri war.

       Every once in a great while we'll nail a scene for one episode
while we're shooting another, by bringing in the director for that
episode for just half a day or so, but generally we tend to avoid it
because it creates complications with the guilds, and it takes a while
to get the waivers.

       It's an easy answer.

       The final 4 would get aired in October.  If there's no season
5, then the fourth one aired is 422, "Sleeping in Light."

       If there is a season 5, 422 is yanked out of the mix and moved
down to occupy 522's slot, and we shoot 501 and get it done in time to
air in place of 422 in October.

                                                                  jms

{original post unavailable}

       There's no need for confusion.  Season 4, as you know, takes
place in 2261.  Season 5 would take place in 2262.

       422, or 522, depending on the breaks, takes place in 2281.  So
it plays just fine either way.

                                                                  jms

      Good...'cause I think you'll like it.

      There is one drawback to some of this, though...I've heard that
some folks on far right/extremist radio stations have looked at some of
the stuff in the show lately and decided that it constitutes an
endorsement of the position that the government is fascist, and that
their pirate stations (voices of the resistance) are the way to go.  I
can only shake my head.

      They were worked out in advance, and yes, the instructions were

       No.  To repeat what I've said here several times, we would move
501 into 422's slot and make that the cliffhanger ending, then 502
becomes the first episode of season 5, and 422 is the last.  So each
season works out to 22 episodes.

       No, 501 isn't written yet, won't be until we get the final
word.  We could certainly get it finished in time for the US airing in
422's spot, and as for getting it done in the UK, assuming a mid-July
start for season 4, means you'd run episodes through late October/early
November so again you're okay.

      Thanks.  I think this concentrated effort has helped me to
become a better writer, though I still have a LONG way to go before I'm
qualified to carry Serling's or Corwin's pencil box.

                                                                  jms

Subject: <MoT> Starfireworks

{original post had no questions}

      Yes, the Grey Council stucture, visually, is designed to bring
the Starfire wheel to mind.  Valen, being something of a smart cookie,
figured it would be wise to tie in whatever he was doing to the
traditions that preceded him.  So they're arranged in a circle, with a
series of lights above them, and the one central light (for Dukhat, for
instance) reserved for the one who had endured and grown to leadership,
but through a somewhat less violent means.

"Finally, the diversity of cultures on Babylon 5 must be a
satisfaction for you as a writer to have so many different voices to
express. "MoT" for me was almost like seguing between playwrights --
Damon Runyan (Garibaldi) to Oscar Wilde (Bester) to Aeschylus (Minbar).
One of the things I have found most appealing about Babylon 5 as a
whole is that the language is similar to the language of the stage. 
That seems rare in a television milieu defined for the most part by
diseases-of-the-week, talk-show spew and courtroom maneuverings."

      Yeah, I like that part a lot, being able to write in lots of
different voices, lots of different styles.  You have to remember that
I cut my teeth writing dialogue back when I was writing plays and
getting them produced.  I love theater, love plays, and love really
well done or rich dialogue.  So it echoes that now...which as you say
isn't necessarily the style of dialogue seen on most television (which
is why a few react weirdly to it), but I like it, and it's my show....

                                                                  jms

      I think Lyta had just emotionally gotten to the place where she

kindness of strangers.

      Well...I don't usually comment on this, but...if I had known
*with absolute certainty* that there would be a season 5, then season 4
would have ended with 418, "Intersections in Real Time."  So you only
pull 4 episodes forward, really.  You'll understand when you see it.

      Correct; specifically, "Crusade" would take place about 3 years

      TNT is a commercial cable network, so there will be commercials.
As I recall, the running time to which I wrote the scripts was 94
minutes 10 seconds.

      Because telepaths only function in very limited ways due to
privacy laws.  You couldn't just use them broad-based as lie detectors
in the way you suggest, because it first requires getting the
*permission* of those involved, and you can be reasonably sure that
smugglers aren't going to want people poking around in their heads;
second, there was a large group there, and a midrange teep can usually
handle only one or at most two people with any degree of accuracy; it
goes down dramatically after that.

      I specifically set up rules for telepaths to avoid letting them
become the deus ex machina, the easy solution to any problem.
