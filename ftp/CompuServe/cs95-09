     Simplest way to tell: if it has the PTEN copyright notice, it's 
usually authorized, same for any other product by other shows.  If 
not, not.

     One-offs, paintings of characters, that's one thing, but if 
somebody's selling mass-produced stuff like links, PPGs, patches 
without any kind of ID on them, you can be sure it ain't legit.

     Just so we're clear, the problem isn't getting WB moving on 
licensing; ever since we got started here, I've been dragging my 
feet on licensing stuff, because I've seen merchandising become the 
tail wagging the dog on TV shows.  I don't want that to happen 
here.  So as stuff comes in, I approve only a few things, selectively, 
that I think can be done, and done well.

     Re: the UK videotape situation...that's something that I have no 
input into whatsoever, as it falls under the jurisdiction of another 
country, and the approval steps are several steps removed from me.

     The B5 baseball cap is available by phone order from Creation 
Entertainment or at any Creation convention.

     As for the sound mix...yeah, we put a great deal of work into 
that aspect, for the surround effect.  If you fire up "Race" there's 
a LOT going on in that one.  It takes a great deal of time, but it's

     There are limits to what the healing device can do, for starters; 
it can't repair physical damage to the body, mainly it works with 
disease and basic low-energy stuff; also, bear in mind that it was a 
device used for *capital punishment*...meaning that to save one person's 
life, another must sacrifice his or her own, if it's that far along, 
so it's not really something you can trot out everytime somebody gets 
nailed.

Creation (and there's a GREAT new mug with the station on the obverse side),
along with a great jacket with the station embroidered on the back.  There

     New sets: yes, and we're creating situations in which we can see more of
Earth, Mars, our other local planets, plus Narn, Centauri, Minbari and one
other major world.  As the Shadow War cranks into gear, you're going to need
a place to meet in security and plan for it, so we're also building that.
We'll see more of Draal's place on Epsilon 3.  And there's one other major
set that we'll see in the first episode, and quite a bit thereafter.

     New characters: well, there's Marcus Cole, a Ranger assigned permanently
to Babylon 5, played by British actor Jason Carter; we'll see Lyta Alexander
more this year; and Theo...what can I say about Theo...well, perhaps better
to let you see for yourself.

ask to screen an episode, but it's very spotty; we don't provide personal
copies until after the episode airs, and only to direct cast and crew

     Actually, much of what's been reported is misconception or 
actors who somewhat...misremember things.

     Bill was never considered a one-shot as Lennier.  It was always 
a recurring role.  That's what we put out in the casting breakdowns 
that went to agents, and that was the understanding when we did 
auditions, and when we negotiated with Bill, and did the main 
titles.

     Pat Tallman's character was *never* intended as a male; at one 
time, I'd considered making Delenn male to start with, then female 
after emerging from the chrysalis, but Lyta...never.

     So there really hasn't been as much divergence as might seem.

     Thanks.  Characters, for me, are the point of a novel, and 
any good story.  Long after the plot becomes fuzzy in memory, you 
remember the people...you remember Ahab and Michael Valentine Smith 
and Charles Dexter Ward....

     Re: not having adjective/adverb disease...there's something 
funny there you wouldn't know about.  See, when I was in high school, 
they had Career Day for the tops in various areas (dance, acting, 
athletics, whatever).  I ended up in the Writing group.  It was held at 
Southwestern College down by San Diego.  I was stuck in this little 
room, and nobody came by, because who wants to see writers when you can 
see athletes and dancers and mimes?

     Finally, a short fellow with salt-and-pepper hair wandered in, 
and went down the line of manuscripts-with-writers, paused at my table.  
(I was writing stories in the Lovecraft/dark horror vein at the time.)  
Took one of my stories, walked off, sat in one of the lawn chairs, 
read it through. Came back, returned the story, took another.  Read that 
one over.  Put it back.  Looked at me for a long moment.

     Then he said: "You have a great and substantial talent for your age. 
Two pieces of advice: one, don't ever let them stop you from telling the 
stories you want to tell; two, cut every third adjective."

     Then he walked off, and as soon as he was out the door, the faculty 
advisor came running at me at warp nine.  "What did he say, what did he say, 
whatdidhesay?"  I told her.  "Don't you know who that was?" she asked.

     I said no, though there was something kinda familiar about him, and 
remember it's always different when you see somebody out of context.  
"That was Rod Serling," she said, "he's here to speak at the college later 
today."

     Had there been a gun within easy reach, I would almost certainly have 
put a bullet into my brain.  By the time I ran out, he was gone.

     That was one of three weirdnesses in my life involving Rod.  
The other two...are stories for another day.

     So when you say I've managed to keep the adjectives down...
I'm very pleased.

starring in a production of Sophocles' classic play ANTIGONE.  This 
modernized version is directed by Mira's husband, Goran Gajic, and 
adapted by Deanne Stillman.  It's a chance to see Mira out of makeup, 
and in a very different kind of role than you've seen before.

     The play is currently running at the Hudson Guild Theater, 6543 
Santa Monica Boulevard, in Hollywood.  Performances are Thursdays-
Saturdays at 8 p.m., Sundays at 7.  Tickets can be acquired by 
calling 213-660-TKTS.

     Before you hit the *kill* button...a thought or two in your general
direction.  First, if you're eager for the actual news part of this message
-- and it is kinda important -- it appears at the end of this message.  If
you've got a second, stick around.

     In every interview he's given on the subject, Walter Koenig has spoken
glowingly of BABYLON 5, as a show he feels is fighting for genuine quality
SF in television, with serious, mature stories for fans who grew up on STAR
TREK and are looking for more of that quality...none other than Majel
Barrett Roddenberry has gone on record at conventions, including Toronto
Trek and the recent Wolf 359 convention, as saying that BABYLON 5 was "the
only other intelligent science fiction series out there" besides the ST
shows, and urged ST fans to support it.

     If you've tried the show, and it wasn't to your tastes...fair enough.
No one should be expected to like everything.  If you'd like to give it
another shot, that's fine, but there is no need to defend your opinion; we
respect it.  Not every show works for every viewer.

     If you *haven't* tried the show...if you liked the original ST and the
work of Majel and Walter and Harlan and others involved in it...if you like
the work of Peter David, who has written for B5 and supports it...you may
want to give it a shot in October/November.

     The final four episodes from year two will be broadcast starting the
week of October 11th, with the new year three episodes beginning the second
week of November.  These nine episodes in a row contain some of the best
work we have ever done.  Acting, writing, directing, effects...we stand
behind all of them.  (The year two Final Four were held back from earlier
broadcast to lead into the debut, so these are new to the US, although they
have already aired to substantial praise in the UK.)

     If perhaps you have been turned off by some of the more vigorous
messages from B5 viewers, I'd only ask that you consider those comments in
light of the fact that Paramount (NOT the people doing ST, but the studio
itself) has done everything possible to hinder the progress of B5, which
engenders certain reactions from everyone; and that to a man or woman,
virtually all of the more vigorous posts have come from those who have long
considered themselves fans of STAR TREK, voicing many of the concerns which
are stated right here in this forum by current viewers...which they had long
before there was a B5...  as well as some of the praises found here.

     The ironic thing is that there is no problem between those who make B5,
and those who make ST..Jeri Taylor is a friend, Majel supports the show,
when ST does an episode with great EFX we call them, when we do a good one
they call us...it's almost entirely a matter of perception.

     So for what it's worth, direct from those of us who make BABYLON 5, if
you haven't checked out the show before, or if you're curious to see where
we stand now...I would like to personally invite you to check out the new
batch of episodes starting around October 11th.  If you want to give us all
nine episodes, that's great; if less, that's fine too.  If not at all,
that's also fine.

     Over a late dinner with Majel, I observed that after the original STAR
TREK, which for the first time presented truly *human* characters, with all
their flaws and frailties and bravery and nobility, in a science fiction
series, the ball was dropped, and no one picked it up again for years.  She
agreed with this...and it is my hope that you will find this coming season
of BABYLON 5 to be that show.

     Because it isn't an either/or, sum/zero game...one can watch, and
enjoy, BABYLON 5 and STAR TREK equally, for different reasons, since their
approaches are very different.  And this is the perfect time to come into
B5, since these episodes encapsulize a lot of background, and will take you
quickly into the background, the universe and the characters.

     Which is why, I'm pleased to announce, Majel Barrett will be appearing
as a guest star on BABYLON 5 this coming season...a gesture of support from
her, and a gesture of respect from all of us at B5.  The deal has been
signed, it's a done deal...she'll be appearing in episode #9, "Point of No
Return," as Emperor Turhan's third wife, Lady Morella.  We're very much
looking forward to her appearance in the B5 universe.

     For all these and other reasons, I hope you'll give BABYLON 5 a try.

                                                                       jms

     (P.S. For the Internet gang...please don't repost this on the 'net until
after Jeannette has broken the news; I promised I'd let her make the
announcement there, after she heard about it at Wolf 359 in the UK, and agreed
to keep this secret for the last week at my request.)

     Actually, we make as sure as possible that every episode contains the
information required to follow it; any needed background is restated or
contained within the episode.  You can see some, all or any other number of
episodes and be able to follow them...in some countries, they're running the

doing okay.

     I'm sorry, Lisa...I hate to say you're exaggerating, or being less than
truthful, but this never happened.  I don't know if you're remembering it
this way out of some defensiveness, but this never happened, and there were
plenty of other people at that panel who can confirm this.

     I have made it a very deliberate point, in any public appearance, not
to put down *anyone* for watching ST.  Never have, never will.  I don't know
if you're attributing comments made by others to me, or simply going off
your emotions of that panel, but it never happened.  I know that Shane
Shellenbarger (noted SF fan/writer based in Arizona) was there that day
videotaping the panel, and I'll drop him a note asking to check the tape and
verify this.

     (I also remember very distinctly at that panel that I kept trying to
change the topic to non-B5 shows, but kept getting yanked back to it by the
other panelists and the audience...in large part because a) I wanted some
info on the other shows, and b) I didn't want to blow the info that I'd come
to use at the big presentation at a small panel, thus eliminating any sense
of drama and becoming redundent.)

     Ellen: thanks.  As for the episode in question, it's entitled "Point of
No Return," and the role of Lady Morella was written specifically for Majel.
I hustled to get it finished prior to the Wolf 359 convention, where I gave
her a copy of the script.  She read it overnight, and fell in love with the
story, the character, and what it was going to do with and to the BABYLON 5
universe (to wit: start turning it upside down).  Next morning, she said
"I'm in." And she is.

     Yes, it's a jms script, and is one of the most pivotal of this season,
episode #9, which with the one before it, "Messages from Earth," builds to a
major turning point in #10, so it should be a very popular, intense and
memorable episode in every respect.

                                                                       jms

give you the info; also, I believe there's a station list in the library

     Thanks.  To me, emotion is the *core* of drama...an episode, a story,
should leave you feeling something...make you worry, or think, or get mad,
or laugh.  So the stories tend to proceed very much from an emotional core.
Thanks for jumping in.

     I often work on more than one thing at the same time; on B5, in
addition to the producing jobs, I'm outlining one script, writing another,
editing a third....

     Prior to B5 (which is all-consuming), I'd often be in somewhat lower
pressure jobs (standard writer/producer, not exec), and would be writing the
episodes, plus a novel, plus stories, plus a screenplay, plus other stuff,
all pretty much at the same time.

     The key, though, is to FINISH what you write.  Otherwise it's useless.

      Yeah, "Messages from Earth" came out quite well as a script; can't
wait for it to roll before the cameras.

      As it happens, episodes 8, 9 and 10 ("Messages," "Point of No Return,"
and "Severed Dreams") are kind of a triptych, linked at the hip and designed
to pull together/blow out several major hanging plot threads once and for
all, and send the show spinning off in an entirely different direction.  The
hardest one to write was 10, because it's a very emotional episode for the
characters, and for me.

      And next is #11, which I begin to write this weekend...and #11, year
three, is the *exact* midpoint of the 5 year story.  This is the hump, the
dead center of the journey.  It took so long to get here, and suddenly we're
halfway finished.

     Re: "No Mrs. Troi on B5," I remember the comments when we mentioned for
the first time that we'd have Walter Koenig on the show.  "Oh, lord, Chekov
on B5."  Then they met his character, Mr. Bester...and nobody said that no
more.  He instantly became one of our more popular, interesting characters.

     Ah, Brian...now that you've appeared in public, allow me to give you one
good-natured, but quite solid thump to the head.

     Remember when we were leaving the hotel the morning after the
convention, and you and your associate gave Kathryn and myself two wrapped
gift boxes?  Well, as you recall, we were in a hurry, so we thanked you
politely, put them in our bags (carry on only, no check through), and
hurried to the waiting cab.

     We got to the airport, and were about to go through the scanners, when
we remembered the boxes.  First rule of international travel: no matter WHO
gives you a package, always open it before going on board, because they'll
ask you.  So we opened the two boxes.

     Which contained letter openers.  About half a foot long.  Reasonably
sharp.

     In other words....KNIVES!  We were about to go into an international
airline with KNIVES in our carry-on bags.

     Do you know, Brian...can you *imagine* the hassle those knives cost us
on the flight?  The conferences with security, the long explanations, the
checking and cross-checking of passports, the knives taken away by security,
then returned in the plane later...then going through the whole thing all
over again at the stop-over in Chicago...having to provide passport and
other ID, getting a Chicago airline security person who happened to know the
show to vouch for me and sign the knives back over to us....

     We had such *splendid* things to say about you during all this, Brian.
You should've heard them.  We were half-tempted to leave the bloody things
at the terminal.  You may want to tell your people next time to THINK before
they give someone a package for international travel.  I can just imagine
what would've happened if we HADN'T checked the boxes before going through
the scanners.  "Are you carrying any weapons or any kind?"  "Nope."  "Then
would you care to explain these items, sir?"  CLANG!  They'd throw away the
key.

     That said...if you're still up for having me at the Encounter,
depending on terms and times, I'm up for it.

     But please...no parting gifts....

                                                                       jms

     Except, of course, that there wasn't "a quick directional change by
offering a new enemy" (in second season) because that enemy - the Shadows --
was in there right from the git-go, in season one...in "Chrysalis," which we
shot #12 even though it was aired #22 as our cliffhanger, and in "Signs and
Portents," short shortly thereafter.  So it was always there, and has always
been there...they're the primary antagonist, in a philosophical sense,
throughout a major part of the story.

     "...and the mutation of another primary character."  This, also, was in
the outline of the story from the very first episode onward; it's
*important* to the story, and wasn't done for any of the reasons you cite.
(The only change here was that Delenn was originally planned to be a male
character, if androgynous, which emerged female from the chrysalis, but we
couldn't get the male-altered voice to sound right, so this was dropped,
though we kept the more-human aspects.)

     You seem to determine "the maturity of the show" by not offering real
or substantive changes; but this show is *about* change, and the choices we
make that create those changes.  There's this notion that if someone's the
captain, he has to stay the captain all the time; which is the element that
many ST fans criticize in TNG as to why Riker stayed first-officer for seven
years, which would kill any other career.

     So it's not a reset, it's an advancement of the storyline...look at
Londo as we first saw him, and now; ditto for G'Kar...we're talking here
major, substantive changes.  That aspect is at the very core of the story.
You really can't look at this as you would a regular episodic drama in that
one respect; "Oh, they just changed characters, so they're just starting all
over again."  That's not the intent at all.

     "the show (TNG) stayed with its basic core of characters and followed a
similar structure...B5 episodes seem to detract from this formula."  Which
is precisely the intent.  I don't like formula, or predictability, or to
lock down a structure and never change it...that's not life, and I try to
make this show emulate life.  People change, die, get promoted, demoted,
transferred, corrupted, redeemed...change, for me, is the *drama* of the
story; to stay static and unchanging the reverse of that.  It's *process*,
and I find process fascinating.

     "I guess patience is a virtue."  Well, I have to say that if you're
waiting for B5 to settle down into a predictable, unchanging formula, you're
going to have a long wait ahead of you, because that's not in the cards. The
changes and developments only pick up greater speed and ramifications the
deeper we go into the storyline.

								       jms

     (PS...as for "all or some of the credit" for the new SF shows going to
ST, much as one might wish that were true, it isn't.  Otherwise you'd've had
a lot more of them in the last 30 years.  I've been in meetings with network
and studio execs, and one reason it took us 5 years to sell B5 was because,
as we were told verbatim, "There's no market in TV for SF other than Trek;
the market won't sustain more than one SF show like that; people don't want
SF, they want ST."  It was used, repeatedly, to justify why you couldn't do
these kinds of shows...and I'd point out that B5 is the FIRST SF show in 30
years, since ST, to be set in the far future, with mankind as a spacefaring
civilization, and with a fully worked out cosmology of other races,
politics, and governments...and particularly one of the very few to go past
two seasons in general.  Now you're getting more SF on the air because the
networks have finally seen that ST does NOT have a death-grip on TV SF, and
other shows, like B5 and X-Files *can* survive.

     (Certainly it was never ST's intent for this to happen, and I'm not
saying that it is or was; but this has definitely been the result, and the
ST shadow has been something for other SF shows to overcome; it has not made
the process easier, only more difficult.  How many American-made space SF
series have gone past 3 seasons other than ST?  It's after 4 seasons that
the networks/studios begin making back their money, and since the answer to
that is "virtually none," you begin to see why they've been reluctant to do
more than stick their toes in over the last three decades.)

     I don't tend to leave out things in my stories, particularly B5, as
much as morph them into something else if I feel it'd work better a
different way.  For any writer to be so hidebound to stick to every single
tiny element of the outline, once one is at the script stage (or the novel
writing stage) is foolish, and I can't think of anyone who doesn't diverge
to one degree or another.

     For me, an outline is basically a series of directions on a map; get
here, turn *right*, take highway 407 to here, get off and proceed south. But
if you get into a part of your trip, and suddenly see that there's a fork in
the road you hadn't anticipated that'll cut hours off your trip, you'd be
foolish not to take it.  Non-writers never understand that; they only see
the work when it's done, not the process, which is alien to them.

     If you make a course correction, you have to make sure everything still
tracks with your goal, natch, or risk getting lost along the way...but to
the "experience" part of your question...that's the instinct that keeps you
ever heading toward your destination.  That comes only with time.  And I've
been at this a LONG time.

     Thanks.  What's compelling, for me, is that the reason the original
Star Trek worked so well is that the actors did a great job portraying those
characters...and ended up becoming tagged as being those characters, so in
the long run were hurt because they couldn't get other work.  But they were
able to make these characters work so well *because they were terrific
actors*.  So if you give a Walter Koenig or others another kind of role,
they'll do just as excellent a job with that as with what went before.

     So the part for Majel will, as stated, be quite different.

     Glad you like the final four; "Inquisitor" is also very much a favorite
of ours, and even though it has far fewer effects than the episodes on
either side of it, lots of folks here consider it possibly our best episode.
And yes, the impact of "Twilight" is pretty much what you describe...just
sort of a stunned silence, and lots of people have said they didn't want to
talk about it for a while afterward, being very moved by it.

     Re: the decision to hold back the final 4...creatively, it was a pain
in the ass, because I wanted them out in July, so people could consider the
implications.  But WB felt that it would give us a leg up on the third
season debut, let us build some momenum with 9 eps in a row rather than just
6-7.  There's an element of truth to that.  So I guess it's a wash....

themselves, and must bring together other forces.

     And in each case, re: Kosh, what they saw was not the *head* of 
their belief, but in essence a supporting being of light; it wasn't 
G'Quon, but G'Lan that G'Kar saw, which was a being that story tells us 
served G'Quon. So you wouldn't see the head of the religion, 
since there can only be one of those, and lots of Vorlons, but each tends 
to have a supporting cast, for lack of a better term.  Those are what 
we perceive the vorlons to be.

     And remember, we didn't see any other human's POV of Kosh but 
Sheridan's.

     No, she wouldn't.  Again, you don't see the *top* of the echelon of any
belief, because there can be only one of those; it's the servants of light you
see (and even the Old Testament makes reference to such things).

     Thanks.  Yes, there's a WW II parallel, not in terms of 
justifying one or the other -- one can make compelling 
arguments for and against the use of atomic weapons to close 
the war, but I leave it to those who were there to have 
made the right decision, because they had to live with it -- 
but in terms of strategy and wartime logic.
