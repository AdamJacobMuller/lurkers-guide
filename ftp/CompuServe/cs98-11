Subject: Londo's Tragic Fate

{original post had no questions}

      Yes, the capital was getting beat up, but there's a difference
between thousands of dead and billions dead...Londo sacrified himself
to save the lives of billions.

Subject: Who's going to V.O.R.

{original post unavailable}

      No actors were ever told they could not attend; never happened. 
And my problem with the Wolf conventions and some of their organizers
is their *lack* of organization, and their refusal to honor such ideas
as not using clips without permission, and otherwise making a mess, and
refusing (after promising to make them available) to provide copies of
the books to verify that the charities they say they promote actually
received any of the profits from the con.

1.  Heard that Jeri Taylor left Star Trek, any chance that she'll come
and work with you on Crusade?

      No, she's hoping to move to Northern California and enter
semi-retirement with her husband, also a friend of mine.  After X-
number of years in the business, we're all entitled to escape.

2.  Any chance that you will work with Angela Landsbury on Crusade?  I
think she's pretty cool.

      I don't think she does cable episodic.

3.  Do you know what a vacation is?

      Does it have fur?

4.  Have you ever owned, been owned by or currently residing with any
cats and if so, got any good stories for us? (you write about them as
if you know them well)

      Yes, but the cat cabal is very chary of its secrets, and if I
betray them they will come after me.

5.  I know that you plan on pulling back regarding your online
presence.  Is that just on the 'Net or here as well?

      Mainly pulling back on the newsgroups, somewhat here.

6.  Is there anyone in the business (actor, director, writer, etc)
that you haven't yet worked with, but would like to?

      Yeah, but it wouldn't be fair to name folks.

                                                                  jms

      I don't believe anyone has spoken to me about Icon yet...as for

"How is this accomplished? Is there some giant archive somewhere where
people can type in key words and get a list of movies where that
word/phrase is used? Are there experts who just know all this stuff? It
seems like finding a character saying exactly the right sentence out of
the thousands of movies in existence would be a difficult and laborious
task."

      No, none that I'm aware of.  You just happen to know something,
and if you can license that snip, you acquire the rights to use it. 
The DD stuff was just stuff that I knew 'cause I'm a cartoon nut.

      This is, of course, the key to the whole reason for the Byron
thing. If it had not gone on as long as it had, had not had the impact
it had on her, she would not be where she is now in the storyline.  You
really needed something *major* to bring her to this point, and that
was it.  Some couldn't figure why the emphasis...well, now they know.

      Everything points somewhere.

{original post had no questions}

      If you saw the arrows initially, then they would have been 'way
too obvious.

      And yeah, the wheel of fire visually has spokes proceeding out
from a central flame; the center burns outward.  And several of the
fires smoldering lately have done that; with Byron it was a literal
flame that has now gone out along the spokes and had substantial
repercussions, with more to come years down the road.

      It's also a Shakespeare quote, "I am bound upon a wheel of fire,
that mine own tears do scald like molten lead."  Which tends to
describe Londo's situation as well.  (King Lear)

                                                                  jms

Subject: <WoF>Sheridan's memory

{original post unavailable}

      Y'know, this discussion kinda baffles me to some extent.

      For starters, Sheridan was only in the future briefly; he was
being beaten and was confused and not sure how much of it was real; he
doesn't know if his going to Z'ha'dum *changed* any of that
future...the events he did see were 20 years down the road, and there's
no way for him to know (as we know, the audience) what connects to
what...he sees only destruction, and that could have happened two weeks
before (there's no rule that says a capital city can be bombed only
once)...no way to know if the keeper may have been implanted days or
months before.  To try and impose a quick understanding of events 20 
years down the road on things happening right now, without knowing the 
context, would be madness...you don't need a keeper to start a war, or
half our own leaders here would have had keepers on them.

      As for Delenn...yes, he heard her talk about their son, but at
the same time, again, that's 20 years down the road.  Their son could
be any age, so the news that she's pregnant will still be a shock
whenever it comes; you may know that you're planning to have kids, that
the doctor says its possible, but when you actually hear the news, it's
a stunner every time.

      His question is a natural one...he doesn't know if the kid in
the future had to be taken out of utero to be sustained until it came
full term, doesn't know if extreme measures had to be taken...his
question is a sensible and justifiable one.

      People are assuming that what *they* know as the audience,
Sheridan knows, which he does not...and assuming that he knows
everything that is to come, or what it means, or how it happens, or in
what context, which he does not.

      His memory is not faulty.

                                                                  jms

      What we had discussed (actor, director and me) was that soul
hunters don't generally get much chance to hang out and talk to people;
they can empathically sense the language, however, when they encounter
others.  At first, he didn't know the language very well, and gradually
became more able to express himself.

      Yeah, my instructions to Chris were the same there as for
another scene next week, "break our hearts."  And the two themes are
actually pretty much the same, since they proceed from similar
contexts.  That section of "Rest" just puts me away every time.

"On a personal note, I have been dreading this last episode, not so
much because of the story, but more because of it's being the end of
Babylon 5. Now that I have watched it I must tell you that I don't feel
depressed or sad. Yes, it was a very moving episode but also an
uplifting story, and I actually feel good.  Like I just finished a good
book, which of course I have except that I watched it rather than read
it."

      That's pretty much the reaction that others have had, which is
what I was hoping for...because in a strange way, as much as it's an
ending, it's also about hope and new beginnings and renewal.

      Thanks....

      Thanks; a lot of folks have come out of lurker-zone on this one,
and it's been great to hear the voices.

might miss it, it was vague enough not to get me in trouble, and it's
kind of a mouse sound.

      Thanks; a lot of folks have come out of lurker-zone on this one,
and it's been great to hear the voices.

      As for Eep, I guess I picked it because it's so small that you
might miss it, it was vague enough not to get me in trouble, and it's
kind of a mouse sound.

      We didn't have the 1997 Hugo when this was filmed.  And thanks.

      It's never been done before; and likely won't again, at least
for a long time.  But the interaction, for me, has been worth it.

      Remember how much money and maintainance it would take to keep a
5 mile long station running.  They could barely do it when there was a
lot of tourism and business coming through; absent that, it's unviable,
and you don't just want to leave it there for folks to come in and take
over.

      Wasn't much else hid...few have noticed the Hugo so far...and
yeah, that was a shot glass...just playing the irony of his finding it.

"The biggest difference I noticed in your old posts was the "tone" --
you seemed more "upbeat". I guess the past 5 years of working 26 hour
days, dealing with online jerks, and fighting with the various suits
over renewal EVERY DAMN YEAR have taken a toll on your overall
outlook."

      It was a number of different factors, really...those wars, the
daily grind of writing and producing this show, the online experiment
(which was 90% terrific and 10% nutcases)...over time, it all takes a
real toll.

      (Somewhat related aside...I was redoing my list of credits the
other day for the PR file, which goes to reporters, and started adding
up how much of what I've written has been produced, on a per-hour
basis.  These are just the produced TV episodes -- half-hour and hour --
and TV movies, nothing else.

      (Came out that if you started watching it all, no repeats, 8
hours a day, it would take you slightly over 3 weeks to see it all.  I
went to lie down for a while after that one.)

                                                                  jms

      Thanks for the kind words, and good luck with your ventures.

      What's the final result?  I hope a document, thousands of pages
long, that chronicles the making of a show on every level, so that
average folks can better understand the process and, thus, better
communicate what it is they want, on the theory that you can never have
what you want until you know how to ask for it, and what your options
are.

      That, and maybe making some people think...if even that is
accomplished, then the experiment was worthwhile.

                                                                  jms
