      Actually, it's more accessible to a new reader than any of the
prior B5 books...it's a totally self-contained work that begins long
before any of our regular characters are born.  I wanted this to be a
solid novel that could exist entirely on its own, absent any knowledge
of B5, but which would tie into the arc for anybody who knows the show.
I think it succeeds admirably.

"...now all those old uniforms are going to go to waste more than
likely, meanwhile, they're a hell of a lot better than that cheesier
new design they've come up with; a pity."

      Funny, everybody said that about our Earthforce uniforms when
the first pictures appeared.  Now they're the preferred standard.

      Further, those uniforms are specific to the mission of the
Excalibur, as uniforms vary within the real military.  The regular
Earthforce uniforms are still very much in use in the Crusade universe.

      Y'know, I'd've thought that, after learning the lessons on B5
about not judging things too quickly -- the costumes are stupid, who's
the guy with the big hair -- that people would have learend to not
prejudge things before they actually see them on film.

      Guess I was wrong.

                                                                  jms

      Let me suggest that the photo does not show the uniforms off to
best advantage.  They are based strongly on West Point uniforms, with
some variation.  The photo is an awful photo, it looks like a polaroid,
and makes them look pretty flat and unattractive.  On actual film, lit
well, they look very nice.

                                                                  jms

      I've been looking at that photo some more, and the more I stare
at it, the more it bugs me, because it's just awful in how it was
taken: you can see the shadows from the flashbulb, it's not composed
well, it looks like a snapshot taken by somebody non-professional, and
the more I think about it, the more I'm not sure where the hell that
shot came from.  We sure as heck didn't provide it.

                                                                  jms

      The TNT memo was apparently real; however, the egregious points
have now been withdrawn, and on top of that, TNT has allocated a big
chunk of change to let us build some new sets and expand stuff.

                                                                  jms

      Things are going well overall; we've filmed 5 episodes, and have
just extended a planned 1 week production hiatus (we take two such
hiatuses -- hiati? -- every year, one in the fall, one in the spring)
and added three paid weeks in order to allow time for construction on a
number of new sets.

                                                                  jms

> Hey!  That's WONDERFUL news!

      What we've done is to try and expedite this so we can have the
new stuff in hand for the maximum number of episodes as quickly as
possible.  We always take a one-week hiatus in every block of episodes
we shoot, all the way through B5's history and now.  One week around
the start of October (depending on the start of filming), then the
Christmas break, then another one-week hiatus midway through the last
10 episodes.

      So what we did here was to add on three weeks to the hiatus,
starting Tuesday.  Well, three paid weeks off for most of the crew
directly involved with the actual filming, anyway.  Construction, art
department, props, wardrobe and other departments will still be working
away to build and dress the sets and stuff so we can get right back
into shooting on with the new stuff in place.

      We're talking here improvements to the corridors, to the
quarters to enlarge them, adding a wardroom/mess hall, an exercise
area...other stuff. We generally add sets each season, and wanted to do
these down the road, but now we have the chance to do them now.

                                                                  jms

      We haven't yet set a composer for Crusade; we're giving a shot
to Evan Chen, a chinese-born classical composer with a strong jazz
background, on A Call to Arms.  How that turns out will determine much
that follows.

                                                                  jms

{original post unavailable}

      Evan's an amazing composer...he came out of Shanghai, studied
music in Russia and Germany, was fast becoming a leading, classically
trained composer, and discovered jazz in his twenties, dropped
everything to come to Chicago and study under some of the best jazz men
around (even if it meant washing dishes to get by).  His stuff is the
most amazing blend of asian influence, classical instrumentation, jazz
and rock backbeats I've ever heard, even using asian scales (somewhat
different from western musical scales) in unexpected places to make
western music sound totally different.

      For a show as different as this, I wanted a completely
different, totally unique sound, something I've never heard before, and
Evan Chen has it.
