DATE: WED 7 DEC 1994 1:08:05 #47775

     Re: "Watch your back," and "You never did know how
to watch your back," yep, that was a bit of deliberate
foreshadowing for "Chrysalis."  When the episode aired,
I mentioned at the time that there was something in that
episode that would later be seen to be ironic or ominous,
but didn't seem so at first.  One or two caught it, but
most didn't.  This show is layered very, VERY carefully.

What would have been even more ominous is if "TKO" was
actually the last episode aired before "Chrysalis", as
was planned at one time.  The "Watch your back" line is
very nearly the last line of the episode, too.

Another scene I'm wondering about was in "And the Sky
Full of Stars", where Dr. Franklin is examining Delenn.
At first I assumed the examination was Franklin's idea,
but now I see it would have been very useful for Delenn
to have her pre-Chrysalis health on record, so that Dr.
Franklin would have a clue what he was dealing with when
she came out of the chrysalis.

Totally off topic, what was the race of that ambassador

ALIENS OR "NON-HUMANS"?
DATE: WED 7 DEC 1994 9:28:08 #48373

     Nope.  Won't do it.  I understand the reason for the
suggestion, but to us, they're aliens.  And that's what we
call them.  There ain't much room in B5 for PC.  But there
*IS* room for fairness...and as a result, while we are
sometimes referred to as humans, more often we're referred
to as aliens by the races.                  ~~~~~

     We don't call them that to their face, and they don't
call us aliens to our face, but among ourselves...that's
what we call each other.  (In fact, in one episode, someone
mentions that the aliens call the oxygen-part of the station
the alien sector.)

     Of course, on the other hand, one of the problems in the
whole PC discussion is that PC has been over-generalized and
often mischaracterized for purposes of debate.  Some days it
seems like any attempt at polite behavior is derided as just
more PC.  There is a difference between certain kinds of
socialized thought-control and manners.  Blurring the line
makes the criticism of the former less useful.  One must pick
one's targets or waste good ammunition on collateral damage.

COMMUNICATOR?
DATE: TUES 6 DEC 1994 7:13:00 #47386
     Okay, let's address this point by point.  (And on
the issue of the ST pin communicator...here's something
you can't see, because it's on your chest, and in which
you CANNOT HAVE A PRIVATE CONVERSATION WITH ANYONE; it's
broadcast loud, and you have to speak in a moderately
loud voice in order to be picked up.  So much for doing
anything on the QT.)

     Now, to ours.  The Link isn't just a communicator;
it's also a tie to the B5 computer system, and it's a
powerbook of sorts.  There are going to be times you want
to be surrepticious in your use of this item (in fact, we
see one such use in an upcoming episode), and that means
tactile imput. Also, you can generally use an item like this
faster than you can talk.  I can hit CONTROL-ESCAPE-DELETE
on my system a hell of a lot faster than I can SAY that.

     So to access considerable amounts of data, including
complicated stuff, you use tactile input.  So now where
do you put it?  You want to put it in a place where you
can see it, where you can manipulate it with just one hand,
and where you can put it close to your mouth or ear if
you wish to speak quietly to someone.  That would indicate
either the wrist or, for purposes of great stability when
using the buttons, on the back of the hand.  The Link has
a gentle molecular bond that adheres it to the back of the
hand. It goes on and off quite quickly and easily.  It can
be plugged into a larger display system.  It can be hidden
easily.  You can plant it as a bug if necessary, and it's
flat enough not to be easily found.

     It's an eminently sensible system; your friend simply
didn't take the time to think it through.  It's the ST
communicator and placement that makes no sense whatsoever to me....

ALIENS OR "NON-HUMANS"?
DATE: SAT 10 DEC 1994 8:48:22
     One other aspect missing from this discussion is that
the word "alien" is not in any way pejorative.  Alien simply
means different, or other.  If you look it up in the Oxford
American Dictionary, the definition of alien is, "a person
who is not a citizen of the country in which he is living;
foreign, not one's own, unfamiliar, a different nature."

     You can have illegal aliens, and *legal* aliens.  There
is absolutely NOTHING wrong with the word.  I noticed people
trying here to come up with a different term, and not being
really able to do so, because the English language already HAS
a perfectly valid word for it.  To be alien is simply to be
alien, nothing good or bad about it, except whatever interpretation
one wishes to bring with it, which has nothing to do with the
quality of the word.

     To say "alien" is neither PC nor non-PC; it's simply
a description. The problem is the continuing politiciziation
of the English language.

B5 RATINGS INFO
DATE: WED 14 DEC 1994 4:50:11
     Since many have inquired, here's a quickie breakdown of
the results of the November sweeps.  (A more detailed posting
is available if anyone wants it, and I can find time to type
the darned thing.)

     Currently, Babylon 5 is in a tie for second place with
Baywatch out of 16 syndicated dramas among the male 18-49
demographic, the one most prized by advertisers.  We're behind
DS9, but far, FAR ahead of such highly promoted dramas as Lonesome Dove.

     B5 also ranks third with women 18-49 and households in
general, also an extremely important demographic and rating.

     (B5's status of Viewers Per Household in the men 18-45
demographic ranks fifth OVERALLl, including networks...pulling
in a more saleable demographic to advertisers than ER, NYPD Blue,
and Northern Exposure.)

     In general, B5's ratings are up 14% to 20% this year overall;
in many markets, though, the increase is even higher.  Chicago, up 25%;
San Francisco, up 100%; Washington DC up 50%; Kansas City up 67%;
San Diego up 80%...you get the idea.

     Significantly, it appears that the majority of new viewers
are coming in via word of mouth about the show.  An independent
survey by a national polling group showed that 59% of those who'd
HEARD about Babylon 5 watched it; the usual percentage of those
who've heard about a show to those who watch it is usually closer
to 34%.  So as the word gets out, we add viewers fairly quickly.

     We're starting to gather real momentum.  The last national
rating we had of 5.2 will put us probably in the top 15-18 of all
syndicated shows (which includes game shows, talk shows and the
like), and keep us firmly in the #2 or #3 spot out of 16-17
dramatic series.

     So to those who've been getting the word out...you're getting
solid, concrete results.  Thoug we won't get a definitive answer
on a third year until probably spring, this is encouraging for us.

DATE: WED 14 DEC 1994 5:12:09 #53806
     The syndication market is going through a LOT of changes
right now; new shows, even some which've performed moderately
well, are dropping like flies. And even if a show is doing very
well, if the markets dry up because the new Paramount Network,
the Warners Network, CBS and Fox have grabbed up all of the
available stations, eliminating possible timeslots...it doesn't
matter how good the show is, you're dead.  So believe me, we're
not assuming ANYthing.

FLINT PROGRESS REPORT
FROM: RANDY J ZIMMERMAN 73363,3717
DATE: SUN 11 DEC 1994 4:28:24 PM #51451

jms;

Last Wednesday (12/7) I took in a petition of around 100 names
that were collected from two local comic shops to our local B5
station (WSMH Fox66), which has decided not to show the next
two episodes (Spider and Soul Mates I believe) due to college
basketball.  They made this decision after having been deluged
with calls and letters from the last "pre-empting" (where we
missed Points and Revelations).  All this dispite the fact that
they are showing first and second year reruns of ST:TNG most
weeknights at 10pm.

In the petition we state our dissapointment over the treatment
they have given B5 over the last year stating that "to say the
least Babylon 5 has been a challenge to watch".  Additionally we
ask that they reschedule B5 to be shown more into the middle of
the week (it's currently seen Saturdays at 10, if at all), with
an additional showing sometimes on the weekends giving it the same
exposure that they gave to the two Star Trek series that they carried.

They accepted the petitions saying that they would "pass it on" to
their main offices in Cincinatti for them to look over, and they
reassured me that B5 would be back...but only for the rest of the
year.  After that they would/could not give me any further information.
All they would say is that it "WOULD help their main offices in making
programming desicions in the future", whatever good that'll do.

The best thing about the petition is to see who's signing it.  I've
asked for name, address (to show that those signing live in the 66
veiwing area) and age (to show that those watching the show have
access to money to buy products advertised on the show).  The average
age is around the upper 20's to lower 30's and range from 13 all the
way to 63, and the majority of the signatures are male, though that's
because the majority of signatures were gathered at the comic shops
(mostly visited by males).

We are still continuing to collect signatures, just in case, and
I'll visit them again in a couple of weeks with an updated list.
It would be a travesty (though VERY typical for Flint I'm afraid)
if our local station decides to drop B5 in order to carry the next
Trek franchise.

I'll continue to keep you informed if you'd like.

Zimm.

P.S., by the way one of the signatures I have is from a 49 year old
Lutheran minister who wanted me to tell you that you have produced
THE most intellectually stimulating television show that he has ever
seen, and to tell you "thanks".  Just thought I'd pass that along.

Daniel;

Thanks for the suggestion!  What a great idea!

That reminds me of something that I didn't mention to Joe, we
actually got a sponsor to request spots on B5.  A hobby shop
that usually runs alot of spots on television this time of year
requested that they have their spots run on B5, so you know
what our station did?

Yep, cut out 30 seconds of the end credits just to run their spots.
The shop was going to raise a heavy complaint last time I talked to them.

I think we're in for an uphill battle here.  I'll keep everyone posted.

Thanks again for the suggestion.

<BABYLON 5 COMIC>
DATE: SAT 10 DEC 1994 8:34:22 #50888
     Nope.  The comic and the series are complementary, but
exclusive; you needn't follow the comic to watch the series
and vice versa.  From time to time, though, some information
will be dropped in one or the other that may eventually surface
in the other; it's just a matter of when.

     My model for this is Alan Ayckbourn's THE NORMAN CONQUESTS.
It's a series of three plays, meant to be performed on three
nights in a row, all set in the same house over the same two
days.  One play is set in the dining room/kitchen, one in the
living room, one in the garden.  You can come see any one of the
plays and have a wonderful night.  If you see all three, though,
you get more of the whole picture of what *really* happened in
those two days.

     The sound quality is often affected by local stations,
how they treat it after it arrives, and sometimes, yes, by
closed captioning, since there is one more transfer done at
that point, and you drop down another generation in film and
sound quality.  Once the episode is out of our hands, there's
little we can do about this aspect.

     Actually, originally, the plan was for President Clark
to indeed notify Ivanova in "Points of Departure," but
introducing a new character in the General added some changes
when we shot the scene.  But by then it was too late to modify
the comic.

     Also, in the comic, Clark doesn't *specify* who's giving
Ivanova the promotion, just that it's being done.  (And Sheridan
comments that he put through the paperwork the day after he
arrived, which tracks with this time-wise.)

Garibaldi's a cop, or if you prefer a Chandleresque

strong sense of justice and an underdeveloped sense
of "Miranda rights".  Frankly he's so New York I wonder
if it's Jerry Doyle's interpretation or it's JMS'
intention.  His language is so New York, in particular
the elevator scene in "Spider", where he admits to Talia
about being a "yutz".  The way he talks, I mean, he seems
so familiar!

also have a bit of a crush on Ivanova.

My feeling was that it was something that had been building
slowly within her ever since the Ironheart episode.  That
although she had been *saying* she was devoted, well...the
difference between the reality of a B5 and the frequent
unreality of STTNG is that folks don't always say exactly what's
on their mind (kind of like the real world.)  As it turned out,
my own thoughts on Talia dovetailed with future plans for her.

Daggair was Pestilence.  Timov was Famine.  Mariel was Death.
Originally I was going to have each of their names reflect their
respective "incarnations," but decided that was too cutesy.  The
only holdover from that idea is Timov's name which is, of course,
Vomit spelled backwards.

"Soul Mates" is basically our Christmas episode.

     In addition to Peter's reply, I'd add that when you say
"why wasn't Mariel arrested on the spot by Garibaldi and her
quarters searched," you omit both legal procedure and evidentiary law.

     You arrest someone AFTER you have reasonable cause and
sufficent evidence to justify it.  You don't need enough evidence
to convict, just to arrest or indict.  So the order is reversed
for starters.

     Second, what evidence *was* there to be found if he HAD searched
her quarters?  She neither brought nor had ANYthing of an incriminating
nature. She bought the figurine in the bazaar...and that's all she had,
and all she used.  There WAS no evidence in her quarters to find.

     (Believe me, I spent 2 years on MURDER, SHE WROTE, and we
learned a lot about how this stuff works.  You can't just go
around arresting people willy nilly, and the evidence must exist,
and be sufficient, and locatable.)

ALIENS OR "NON-HUMANS?"
DATE: THURS 15 DEC 1994 4:40:25 #54574
     More and more, it seems that language is used to distance
us from the world, rather than describing the world as accurately
as possible.  We lumber it with political vagueness and redundency
("make the character more pro-active"...no, the term is "make the
character more active," the pro is simply redundent and wrongheaded).

     George Carlin made the excellent point that if we were still
saying "shell-shocked veterans" rather than "veterans with
post-traumatic stress syndrome," they might've gotten some of the
help they needed a long time ago. Or even "battle fatigue."  Once
language pierced the veil to the real world; now it has BECOME
the veil behind which the real world is obscured.

     As a kid, I was...shall we say...problematic.  And in
one of the schools I attended, discipline was enacted in,
among other things, transcribing pages out of the dictionary.
Verbatim.  Which is one reason why I have a fairly extensive
vocabulary...up to the letter N, which is as far as I'd gotten
when we moved.

"Well, you could put a bag over his head and do it for Babylon 5."

     Mira is paid for 22 out of 22 episodes, whether she appears in
that episode or not.  Same with Bruce, Jerry, Claudia, others.  We
use the character only when the character has something to *do*.  We
could try to work her into every episode...but then it'd be *working
her in*, and that means adjusting the story and possibly injecting
false notes just to have someone in it.  We don't do that.  Having her
and other cast members in for 22 guarantees their availability.

                                                                  jms

I've definitely noticed in the past, oh, month or so, an up-tick in casual
acquaintances who seem to have checked into B5, at office and elsewhere.
You know you've broken through when people start using one-offs from the
series in ordinary conversation, e.g., at the coffee pot: "Those donuts
are my second favorite thing in the universe." And yesterday one of the
co-workers surprised the heck out of me by engaging me in a detailed
analysis of the B5 back story. Heretofore this particular Trekker barely
had admitted to even watching B5. It's happening, but one hopes it's not
too late for the pebbles to vote. :)

     The syndication market is going through a LOT of changes
right now; new shows, even some which've performed moderately
well, are dropping like flies. And even if a show is doing very
well, if the markets dry up because the new Paramount Network,
the Warners Network, CBS and Fox have grabbed up all of the
available stations, eliminating possible timeslots...it doesn't
matter how good the show is, you're dead.  So believe me, we're
not assuming ANYthing.

     No, in one-third gravity, nobody's hair would be
floating around.  And in case of a serious situation,
the hair goes back quickly.  For most non- combat
situations, *as in the real military*, there's no need
to constantly wear it in a braid.  The main requirement
is that hair be kept OFF the epaulets, where rank is
noted.  We're maintaining correct military regs as currently
established.

     Except of course that there's a difference between moderate
to low (one third) gravity and micro-gravity.  Even on the moon,
in one-sixth gravity, astronauts functioned pretty much normally,
their hair didn't float around (granted it was short), but the
effect of one-third gravity isn't as extreme as you're indicating.

      Of course, thus far we have never seen it in any way
interfere with her duties, or the perception of her; I think
in the latter case, males've grown up a little in this respect.
I think she's comfortable enough with herself to wear her hair
any darned way she pleases, knowing it won't be any kind of
problem.  (Hell, a nest of angry ferrets in her hair wouldn't
even slow her down....)

     *Nothing* has been changed in Ivanova's character.  The
character has in general gotten a little more comfortable with
her surroundings -- last season began with her very much the
New Kid on the Block, having just arrived there, and not really
knowing anyone, so she was a bit on the defensive side -- but
that's all.

     Actually, a few women shuttle astronauts *have*
gone out with long hair, meaning almost shoulder length,
and what it tends to do is stick straight up. But in any
event, again, it's not really an issue in B5 since there's
a good sized gravity there.  When she flies a starfury,
her hair is bound and behind her in the helmet.
