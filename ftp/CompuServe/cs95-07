From:  J. Michael Straczynski, 71016,1644#259272

     I'm involved in the books quite a bit, inclusive of 
reading the manuscripts and approving premises.  Some stuff 
slips past me, mainly in the small details, but the bigger 
picture is generally consistent with the show.

     The role of Na'Toth has not worked out as well in the 
second season as the first; I may rethink my approach on 
this a bit.

     Have recently grown a beard.  The two most consistent 
comments I get:

     1) "Good heavens, it's so GREY!"

he's going through a mid-life crisis too."

     Yeah, well, you only need to watch Dole hold a pencil to 
figure out why he came out for the disabilities act; if it's in 
his personal interest, then he's for it; if it serves the rest 
of the commonweal (except the big money boys, which thus also 
constitutes a personal interest), he's a'gin it.

     I can't technically endorse *anything* until there's a 
business plan and things get real.  Y'unnderstand, I get asked 
CONSTANTLY to endorse one convention or another in the 
nascent stages, "We haven't done this before, but if you'll 
endorse us, we know we can do it," and I'm the one who gets the 
rap if things don't work out.  So I really can't comment in 
any kind of official capacity until this would get real-er.

     There are some deliberate connotations to be derived from 
choosing Agamemnon, yes. Particularly as re: Cassandra, given 
that G'Kar is our nominal Cassandra figure in the 
story...someone gifted with the power of prophecy (though not 
literally in G'Kar's case) who was cursed in that no one would 
never believe her until it was too late.

     I certainly hope so.  We've done all we can to help the 
process along. We've put many of our actors up for it via the 
application process, which is time-consuming and expensive, 
we made videocassettes up for academy members of two of our 
best episodes ("Coming --" and "Geometry of Shadows"), also 
very expensive...so we can only hope they get the 
recognition they deserve.

     I think we'll have a strong shot at some of the technical 
areas, like EFX, costuming, makeup, sound editing, music, that 
sort of thing, IF enough academy members actually *look* at the 
episodes, but the non-tech stuff, acting/writing/directing, are 
always long-shots in the SF genre, sadly.

     Thanks.  He's a fascinating character to explore, and 
the most careful balancing act of the bunch; part of the 
character's appeal is that on a very fundamental level, 
you *like* him, and you don't want to see him on this 
terrible slide downward.  So every so often, you have 
to pull him back, go in a different direction, remind us of 
his basic humanity and potential for heroism.  He is, really, 
any of us caught in a web of events spinning more and more 
out of control every day.

     Larry's greatest skill is as a world-builder, and a 
script doctor in working with other writers.  The former 
comes from his background as a gamer, the latter from his 
years in TV.

     Problem with B5 is that this world is already built 
pretty completely, from one end to the other.  Also, the job 
of a story editor is mainly to sit and listen to pitches from 
outside writers, and to rewrite their scripts when they come 
in.  But in the case of B5, virtually all the scripts were 
based on presmises I'd assigned to writers; we took maybe two 
pitches in two years.  I wrote 12 scripts in year one, 15 in 
year two, and personally did just nearly all the rewrites on 
freelance scripts in year two.  Bottom line, there wasn't 
much for Larry to *do*, and there was a growing sense of 
frustration, in that he wasn't in a position to do what he's 
good at doing. So finally we parted ways.  Not much more to 
it than that.

which was done by local fans.  I definitely encourage folks 
to be there for the 11am-1pm presentation I'm doing if you're 
*anywhere* in the San Diego area, because the presentation 
I'm giving won't be given again until after the new season

     No confirmed cast members at this point, since they

     Bad enough that Big Bang stiffed Michael O'Hare for the 
remaining $5,000 on his fee to attend the convention, bad 
enough the check to Mark Hammil to reimburse his travel 
expenses bounced, but I was just told today that the check for the 
remainder of his fee, $10,000, ALSO bounced.  There are vague 
mumblings about how they hope to replace the 
check in, oh, three months or so, but nobody's holding out any hopes.

     And, of course, there was the check to Walter Koenig that bounced 
and had to be replaced (fortunately this happened just *before* the 
convention, so he was able to make it clear he wouldn't attend if 
it wasn't replaced immediately), the many people who still haven't 
gotten refunds....

     There were a few people here offering apologia and explanations 
for the behavior of Big Bang/CMC earlier.  I note we haven't heard much 
from them here of late.

     This behavior is unconscionable and unforgiveable.

      There has always been a certain element of Jungian archetypes in the

<A question: I noticed for the first time while watching 'Hunter, Prey' 
tonight that the oxygen mask that Sheridan wore while visiting Kosh in his 
quarters is lit from the inside. I'm wondering, is it to better light the 
actor's facial expressions inside so the camera can get a 
better view or does it serve some other function? Maybe it prevents glare or 
unwanted reflections on the outside of the faceplate? Thanks.>

     Er, it does both.  Yeah, that's it, that's my theory, and I'm 
sticking to it.

     Though mainly it does make the actor's face clearer.

     Yeah, I've read Jaynes' book, and was fascinated by it.  
But then I've always found the whole issue of the function of

      It's a flashlight, and he's also holding one.  You caught 
a very small glitch.  Originally, he came out, flashed twice with 
his flashlight, giving the code; then she did the same, and 
THEN stepped out of the shadows, putting her flashlight down on 
the ledge beside her.  It took too long, though, interminably, 
so when we edited it, we cut out that sequence...and

this month...

	From an Exhibitor who attended BB; John Delancie was left at 
the airport for 3 hours!
	When he finally arrived at the Con, he was told that his 
presentation was cancelled because he was late. He stood up to them, 
reportedly, saying that the presentation would go on because it was 
thru their fault, not his, that he was late.
	When attempting to go on with the presentation, the BB people 
shut off his lights and microphone. DeLancie then told those who were 
interested could meet him outside and he would talk to them.
	The auditorium where the autograph line was had been 
sandblasted the day before. For four hours, while the Big Bang 
Security Geeks let their *friends* ahead of everyone else, the fans 
were breathing concrete dust!
	Everyone was told there would be a limit to 2 autographs - to 
which Mr. DeLancie responded by signing everything he could get his 
hands on! BRAVO!
	My source for this info (as he related to me) knew there was
problems when he got in the taxi and the driver never even heard of the 
place!

     You can't move the NASA zero-g trainer; it's where it is, in 
Florida. We're in California.  Also, they don't really have a zero-g 
trainer in the sense you mean; they have a water-tank that simulates 
zero-g using carefully balanced counterweights and lifts.  Again, that 
won't transport to CA.  We can't use the Vomit Comet airplane in a series 
like this, which only lets you shoot for 30 seconds at a time, at hideous 
cost.

     We have, however, vastly improved the interior of the station, which 
you'll see in more detail than ever before in one of the final four 
episodes.  I think it's a *substantial* improvement.

     Not to pick nits...X-FILES got nominated for Best Series, only 
the second time this has happened (I think the first was TNG, which 
I believe got a nomination in its final year).  So that's very 
encouraging.

     And we've gotten 3 nominations so far, and as for EFX, the 
ballots are still being counted in this and several other areas in 
which we think we have a good shot.

     Three nominations ain't bad...Kung Fu got zero, Baywatch zero,

     Actually, I only included Hercules because it's genre.

     In going over the list, you realize how kinda special this is; out 
of all the shows on television, network and syndicated, only 62 series, 
movies, comedies or specials were nominated; out of that, only ELEVEN are 
dramatic series.  And that eleven includes DS9, ST:V, X-Files and B5.  
So four out of those eleven dramatic series are genre series, about 
45%.  That ain't bad.

     And this time at bat, B5 got as many nominations as The John 
Larroquette Show, the Kennedy Center Honors, the Liz Taylor story, 
Murder She Wrote, Murphy Brown, the Simpsons and the Tonight Show.  And 
*more* nominations than Lois and Clark, Love & War, Politically Incorrect 
and DS9, among others.

     So apart from the actors situation, I don't feel in the least 
slighted.

      As an aside...there are other areas in which we hope to receive 
recognition, among them directing, special effects, music and sound 
editing. Those ballots are still being counted, however, and won't be 
announced for another week or two.

     That aside, it's *very* hard to get actors recognized for their 
work in SF.  Ditto writing.  But we continue to improve.  The pilot B5 
movie got one nomination; the first season got two; the second season has 
gotten three so far, and possibly one or two more yet to come.

     If we keep going at this rate, it's going to be impossible for them 
to ignore us for long.  As is the case with X-Files.  They've begun 
receiving nominations in areas normally reserved for mainstream shows (and 
I'm absolutely thrilled spitless that they got the nom for Best Series; that's 
just terrific), so that bodes well for gradual change in the industry, and 
for B5 to start getting recognition in those same areas.

     Hmmm...if your info is correct (not saying it isn't, only 
that I haven't heard this new bit), the "new season" that begins 
for Voyager in August probably consists of the last 4 episodes 
they held back from their first season.  Assuming they play through, 
then the next month would have new season two episodes.  They 
only started filming their season recently, so they're really going 
to have to rush post-production to get material out there in time to 
meet airdates.

     Doesn't affect us at all (except perhaps the Mountain is hoping 
to get a leg up a bit), but I hope it doesn't cause compromises in 
quality to do it that fast.

     (The Mountain is LAspeak for Paramount; Warner Bros. is the

     Re: advice on getting your foot in the door.

     Have a persistent foot.

     Write constantly.  For anyone and everyone.

     Patience, determination, direction and strength.

     And never follow somebody else's path; it doesn't work 
the same way twice for anyone...the path follows you and rolls 
up behind you as you walk, forcing the next person to find their 
own way.

     Warners is legitimately concerned about people offering to 
make mass numbers of copies of episodes and send them out to 
others, whether for profit or not.  Particularly when 
they haven't been seen in this country, such that it violates a 
lot of laws both domestic and international.  If someone is 
engaging in mass copying, be assured that Warners will have 
men with badges knocking on their doors in very short order.

     Everyone always tells you it won't happen, you're wasting 
your time, it's pointless...because that's how they want to think, 
because someone achieving something makes someone who may not have 
done so feel self- conscoius, because they KNOW you and as it says 
in the New Testament "A prophet is without honor only in his own 
land and among his own people," and because overall the system is 
designed to keep you IN.  A writer by nature removes him- or herself 
from the system of 9-5 office type work.  Over time you make your 
own hours, your own schedule, you select who you work for... you're 
outside the normal space/time continuum, and between you and that 
goal is one hell of a lot of surface tension.

     Every writer has been told, at some point, "You'll never make 
it, why waste your time?"  Ninety percent of the time, they're right.  
Ten percent of the time they're not.  But you won't know which camp 
you fall in until you try.

     The differences between screenwriting and a novel...would take 
a book to communicate.  Suffice for now to say just that the strengths 
of a novel are all internal (internal monologue, POV, narrative 
descriptions), and the strength of a screenplay is all external 
(dialogue and visuals).

     Which is why the best novels often make the worst movies.

     There is no pre-determined male/female ratio on the show; it's 
pretty much the luck of the draw or the script.  One thing that might 
help, though, is that we've changed casting directors.  We kinda kept 
nudging the one before for a greater diversity in guest roles (looking 
for different ethnic groups, looking for men and women equally in parts 
that can go either way), and our new one is definitely more inclined 
in that direction, so this will doubtless improve.

     Re: things you don't expect to happen...that's kind of one 
aspect I was after here.  By way of comparison....

     There's one great thing about The Shining, despite some other 
flaws in the film: they set up Scatman Cruthers (sp?) as the one guy 
who understands what's going on...he gets the Shining, he's a potentially 
heroic character, and when all hell breaks loose, he's the one to 
get into the snow plow, cross terrible weather, we're all sure he's going 
to get there and fight the menace...he overcomes weather and nonsense 
to get there...he blows through the front door, ready for action....
and gets an axe in the middle of his chest and dies.

     I *loved* that, and always kinda wanted to something of that nature, 
where you set someone up to be that kind of character, the future, 
whatever, then you yank it back and let the audience say, Oh, hell, 
NOW what?

in Z'ha'dum and others...always showing the reflection, her opposite, 
just to set stuff up on an emotional/symbological level.

come back after something like this.  "Talia" has been destroyed

unit, with very expensive "parts."  Of the two, Talia would've been far more
expendable.  And I don't recall that Control actually issued any death order;
it was the Psi Corps/B13 in any event.

     The problem in trying to keep something mysterious and 
vague is thatsometimes you can outsmart yourself, and get 
confusing.  The *theory* isthat there was the Bureau as Control 
overall back on Earth; and a minor Control figure on B5.  And 
Controls are always referred to as "he"regardless of the facts 
to avoid giving any means of identification to anoutsider based 
on gender.

     So it would be

                            BUREAU CONTROL
            ----------------------|---------------------
            |                     |                    |
      Earthdome Control      B5 Control         Minipax Control


     (That's a breakdown using artificial and not necessarily
correctelements, just for illustration.)

     It is, however, a confusing bit of terminology, so it's been 
amended subsequently.

<I wonder if you would settle an argument that has been raging about 
the shooting at Lyta in Divided Loyalties.
Is the hand with the gun  Left or Right?>

     I don't remember offhand; I'll have to check the tape.  (I have a 
vague memory that it was a right hand originally, flopped to shoot in the 
other direction.)
