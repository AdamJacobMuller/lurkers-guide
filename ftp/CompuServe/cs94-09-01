BABYLON 5: MINBARI CASTES #801209 (Reposted with author's permission)
DATE: WED AUG 24, 1994 12:46:08
FROM: IMS, 75050,357

Question: Do the Religious Caste perform functions
similar to our organized religions for the Warrior
Caste and workers?  It would seem that the Religious
Caste could either be the ones who provide spiritual
guidance, rituals, ceremonies, religious teaching, etc.
for the others or they could be more monastic in nature
preferring a scholarly, aloof lifestyle separate from
the other two groups.

I'm curious about the role of the Religious Caste in
everyday Minbari life.

Thanks for a great show!

     That describes it pretty well; I'll probably
get into this more in detail down the road a piece.

     Usually, depending on circumstances, it takes me about 2 weeks to
write any episode of a TV series, including B5.  That's from zero, no
outline, to finished script.  I've done it in as little time as two days
(when I was on Murder, She Wrote).  Optimum is about 7-10 days.

                                                                 jms

     "What was the hardest thing you ever had to write?"

     Usually it's the next thing...whatever that happens to be.

     (If you take it out of the area of scripts, then the hardest
thing I've ever had to write was my second novel, emotionally and
physically, since I was doing about 3 jobs simultaneously.  The next
really major hurdle waiting for me is my planned 3rd novel, which
will be around 1,000 pages and extremely complex.)

     Generally speaking, I don't write for other shows.
The pilot for the other SF series was written during
the hiatus.  I haven't written for any other series
since taking on B5.

BABYLON 5: NEW JMS PROJECTS #803996

     Yes, but I separate out "movies" from "shows/series."  The
GRIMJACK screenplay will be turn in around the end of the year.
If the other pilot should go to series, I'll exec produce and
write some of it, but will have to bring on a qualified show runner
for day-to-day operations.

DATE: FRI AUG 26, 1994 11:34:12 PM

     A lot of other shows now gearing up are looking to the B5 "model"
as they call it for what to do, including CGI.  The only show that is
not going to CGI, it seems, is ST.

     The result of all this, one hopes will be more SF series coming out
where because there isn't the constant concern about what EFX you can and
can't do, they can concentrate more on the story.

                                                                  jms

BABYLON 5: AFTER THE 2ND SEASON #802639
DATE: THURS AUG 25, 1994 9:06:30 PM

     The SF channel doesn't have the money required to produce full scale
dramatic series, which is why they do basic talk-format shows.  And B5 is
basically owned by PTEN, not me (the same way Paramount owned ST, not
Roddenberry).  So anything afterward becomes highly problematic.

recovering, a commander with a death wish, a second in command
going through the emotional turmoil of sitting shiva for her
dead father and still dealing with the death of her mother by
suicide... well, I could go on, but I don't much see the point.
What you see is what you see.

     Yes, CGI will be used in the second project we're doing, which is
even more challenging (and interesting) from an EFX perspective because
there will be a lot of location filming.

     As far as the amount of CGI for this coming season...as with our
first season, there will be as much as the stories require, no less, no
more.  The effects have to service the story, not the other way around.

 from #802665)
-----------------------------------
BABYLON 5: RERUNS #802936
DATE: FRI AUG 26, 1994 1:30:21 AM

     Actually, I'm not entirely sure that's true.  I've been tracking
the audience response, and the ratings for the last seven weeks have
ALL increased over the one before, a step up every week by as much as a
third of a ratings point.  So we're suddenly adding a *lot* of new
viewers to whom the reruns are first-run.

     Also, gauging from the mail we get at the B5 offices, we've added a
lot of new viewers since TNG went off the air.  Several people have
written in to say that while TNG was on, they felt funny about going over
to B5, despite having heard some good things about it.  When TNG was gone,
one of those obstacles was removed, and now they've been sampling the show.

     Finally, after being on the air for a full year, there's finally been
enough time for word of mouth to start getting around, and that's also
adding to the viewership.  So I suspect that there will be a fair number
of folks with comments about reruns that they're seeing for the first time.

                                                                   jms
BABYLON 5: O'HARE/SINCLAIR--WHY?? #805194
DATE: SUN AUG 28, 1994 3:38:30 AM

     Actually, yes, I believe there is a Michael O'Hare Fan Club; I saw
a posting on Internet about it...maybe someone else here saw it and can
relay the details.

     I have, btw, now seen the finished (minus music and some minimal EFX)
first episode of B5 with Bruce.  We did the producer's cut yesterday, and
I have to say that I think it's very nice.  Last season's first episode was,
I think (and as I said at the time), a bit less than it could've been from
a characterization point of view.  That was something we grew into slowly
over the course of the season.

     In this year two first-episode, there's a lot of humor, some interesting
plot turns, and a very solid emphasis on the characters.  It's sort of a
sandwich episode; "Chrysalis," the last year one episode (which apparently
will air a week prior to season two's debut), is *extremely* intense...so is
the second episode of year two, "Revelations."  People are going to need
some respite from that, and "Points of Departure" does this quite nicely.

     And Bruce does a wonderful job in the role.  He's brought a lot to the
table, and I think people are going to be very pleased.

                                                                       jms

To all and sundry...just to put some closure on the whole David Alexander
situation, I thought I'd pass this along.  Near as I can tell, this is a
reply to a message of mine, here on this forum, that scrolled off the
forum and ended up in DA's mailbox.  He replied to it.  Since it was a
reply to a public message, I'm passing it along here, in toto, without
revision or distortion.  (All I can assume from memory is that I was
noting in my original message that he never did deal with *any* of the
issues raised in my original posting calling several of his statements
into question, particularly when they contradicted one another.

The only comment that I would make on the following is that 1) I never got
ANY answers to ANY of the questions raised, which kinda makes moot the
"not to your liking" aspect, and 2) I never said, implied, or stated that
I was any kind of authority on Roddenberry's life...my questions were
based strictly on the statements made by Alexander within the context of
his message, which seemed to clearly indicate substantial bias against
Gerrold and others.

Once again, the question is misstated and bent to make it easier to attack.
Ah, well...message follows.

Reply to: Message Scrolled from SF & Fantasy Forum

Mr. Straczinski,

You labor under the illusion that because you send questions and demand a
response that I am, somehow, under obligation to respond, and if those
answers are not to your liking, then I am to respond again and again to
any and all questions you care to put - as if you were some sort of final
authority on the truth of Gene Roddenberry's life or my motivation in
writing his biography.  I have no interest in becoming involved in what
is clearly a CompuServe "tar baby."

I admit that I was unaware of the "rules of behavior," that one had to
cleverly couch one's insults and snottiness in polite language. Of
course, I had been  attacked and accused of a number of things, including
felonious behavior, for several weeks before I came on the forum, but
that doesn't seem to matter.  I was blunt in my response and a number of
people took insult and made their feelings known publicly - but a number
of people also wrote me privately, telling me how funny they thought it
was and how deserving they thought you were.

When I was a child, we were plagued with door to door salesmen.  My mother
had a sign made up that was quite effective.

"You have nothing to sell or give away that I am interested in. Please do
not waste your time and mine by calling me to the door.
                                                Thank You"

I think that sentiment is appropriate here.  My error was not invoking it
at the beginning.

STAR TREK: START OF VOYAGER #803030
DATE: FRI AUG 26, 1994 4:37:07 AM

     Today's DAILY VARIETY had a big article about the problems over on
Voyager, titled CAPTAIN QUEST LEAVES ENTERPRISE ON AUTOPILOT.  (Some
edits for space follow; nothing significant was omitted.)

     "The search for a captain for "Star Trek: Voyager"...has at least
reached yellow-alert status.  Though production was to begin next Monday,
the show shut down Tuesday because of an inability to get a star, or even
figure out whether to weave a male or female uniform...."

     It talks about ST fans faxing Paramount "unhappy missives because of
rumors the studio was trying to fill the role with a male actor."  Plans
for a female character "has yet to yield a candidate acceptable to both
the producers and Paramount."

     It mentions some of the candidates, including Susan Gibney, then
notes: "The studio, apparently concerned that the traditionally strong
male demos of "Star Trek" warranted a male star, was initially cool to
Gibney and widened the search to men.  Sources said the studio is high
on Nigel Havers, the British actor known for 'Chariots of Fire.'

     "Though speculation is the show could still begin shooting Monday
around its non-cast, that would be a challenge.  Scripts would have to be
rewritten depending on who gets the top job."

     Last coment from the article: "Par might be skeptical about handing
over the keys to the Enterprise to a woman," and then goes on to mention
that the person being brought on potentially to run one of the new nets is
a woman, which then goes off on another tangent.

     If the studio would just let talented people like Jeri Taylor alone
to do their job, they wouldn't be *in* this fix.  But it's The Franchise,
and the studio doesn't ever want to do anything risky to endanger that
franchise.

     No, the parents were not charged with murder.  When a species
on the station acts against one of their own kind in a particular
way, and no other species is affected, they are judged by the laws
that apply to their own species and culture.  In their culture,
what they did is not a crime, so they received no punishment.  Had
they done this to a human, then yes, they would have been charged
with murder.

     Funny thing is...the word on the street is that Ed Marinara's agent
was just about to release a press release (or did release one) last week
stating that Ed was going to be the new captain.  If something happened
at the last moment, then that's very interesting.

     Either way, I think it's an excellent choice, and in the rush
of people crediting Berman and Pillar, I think perhaps a few might
want to credit Jeri Taylor, who was the most vigorous in pushing
for this, and fought very hard for it.  As co-creator of Voyager,
she often gets insufficient credit due to the familiarity of Berman
and Pillar.  She keeps a lower profile, but don't lose sight of her.

     The 2.5 million tons of spinning *metal* refers only to that part,
the metal casing.  It doesn't include the furniture, the structures,
the Garden, the 250,000 humans and aliens...so the total mass of the thing
is MUCH greater than the 2.5 megatons.  Also, the body was shoved out of
the area around the cargo bay, non-rotating, which would also cut down on
the momentum (as opposed to shoving out out of the rotating part, where
it would speed away at 1g).

     Actually, I disagree when you say that the doctor was right.
Says who?  Not the parents.  Not the episode.  Nobody was really
right, when you come down to it, except maybe Sinclair, who made
the correct call.  You say the boy was okay at the end...the parents
didn't think so.  Who's to say if there was or wasn't a soul inside?

     I think David's script walked a very fine line and really didn't
endorse either side.  (I've had people send me email upset because we
showed that the parents were right, and others because we said the doctor
was right, and others because neither was right and the ambiguity
bothered them.)

     A lot of our episodes are constructed to work as mirrors; you see
what you put into it.  "Believers" has been interpreted as pro-religion,
anti- religion, and religion-neutral..."Quality" has been interpreted,
as you note, as pro-capital punishment, and anti-capital punishment.  We
do, as you say, much prefer to leave the decision on what things mean
to the viewer to hash out.

     A good story should provoke discussion, debate, argument...and
the occasional bar fight.

     Re: the elevator/transport tube gag...yes, we set this stuff up
WAY in advance.  The first time is in the tube where he tells Talia
about his second favorite thing in the universe. The second time is
in "Mind War" when he gives her the mental once-over and she belts him.
And then we paid it off later with her line about him always being there.

     One nice thing about the way we're doing this show is that we don't
just have to set up gags within an episode; we can set them up *weeks*
ahead of time, as long as the payoff is self-contained, but then when
you see the earlier shows, now you get more out of it.

     No real reason, he just felt it would be better for the character
to remain mysterious; and since it really wasn't a big part, it wouldn't
make a real difference one way or another in his credits and resume.

BABYLON 5: B5 CAST ANNOUNCEMENT! #805620
DATE: SUN AUG 28, 1994 6:11:18 PM

     We decided to try an even stranger approach, and have Sinclair
show up again about *mid-way through* the second season once or twice.
There needs to be some mystery to his departure, which being there to
shepherd the New Guy would destroy.

     And at the same time, the comic from DC will follow the Sinclair
line after he leaves B5 for the first four issues in particular, starting
by showing the flip-side of what happens in the first episode.

     What you suggest is perfectly reasonable; I agree that the tactic
should be unusual.  And we think this may well qualify....

     Actually, yes, I believe there is a Michael O'Hare Fan Club; I saw
a posting on Internet about it...maybe someone else here saw it and can
relay the details.

     I have, btw, now seen the finished (minus music and some minimal EFX)
first episode of B5 with Bruce.  We did the producer's cut yesterday, and
I have to say that I think it's very nice.  Last season's first episode was,
I think (and as I said at the time), a bit less than it could've been from
a characterization point of view.  That was something we grew into slowly
over the course of the season.

     In this year two first-episode, there's a lot of humor, some
interesting plot turns, and a very solid emphasis on the characters.
It's sort of a sandwich episode; "Chrysalis," the last year one episode
(which apparently will air a week prior to season two's debut), is
*extremely* intense...so is the second episode of year two, "Revelations."
People are going to need some respite from that, and "Points of Departure"
does this quite nicely.

     And Bruce does a wonderful job in the role.  He's brought a lot to
the table, and I think people are going to be very pleased.

BABYLON 5: TIME-WARNER&MERGERS #809789
DATE: THURS SEPT 1, 1994 4:51:00

     You kind of have to begin this conversation with the understanding
that my grasp of matters corporate is not exactly breathtaking; I'm not
quite an idiot on such matters, but I can do a darned good imitation
some days.

     Disclaimers aside...in general, the more you tend to concentrate power
over artistic affairs and programming and the creation of TV series in an
increasingly smaller number of people, I think the worse it is overall for
the industry.  Let's say you make a fairly eccentric product.  If there are
500 buyers in the room, the odds are decent that you'll find somebody who
resonates with your ideas.  If suddenly the number of potential buyers
decrease to 10, then the odds of your ever selling that project become
substantially less.

     I can see the fiscal advantage in owning the point of creation and
production, and the point of distribution, in a studio/network merger.
It gives you considerably greater control, and greater revenue sources;
you don't have to worry about the distributer cross-collatoralizing your
revenue streams against fees they shouldn't be charging.  But then that's
really the point...it's a *financial* decision, not a creative one, and
though I know that showbiz *is* a BUSINESS, still that sort of approach
worries me just a bit.

                                                                     jms

     Thanks for your comments.  As it happens, your comments were echoed
today by no less than Leslie Stevens (with Joe Stefano the force behind
THE OUTER LIMITS), who came by the studio for a tour, just to say how much
he loves the show, and the details, and the care with which we produce it.
He's just enamored of the whole thing, and coming from him, that's high
praise indeed.  A very nice and gentle man.

     To the question of producing LoTR for TV...there are two competing
aspects to the question: desire and practicality.  A lot of writer/producers
(viz: folks like me) would *love* beyond the telling the chance to do LoTR.
The flip side of this is the practicality of trying something that truly
massive from a budgetary and location point of view, which would scare off
the networks.  Right now, simply from a physical standpoint, it couldn't
be done effectively, no matter how much you spent.  Virtually *all* the
locations would have to be built, though you might be able to go on
location for a few things like castles and forests.  But how would you do
Mordor?  Or Lothorien?  Or the Shire?  Or Rivendell?  Or the high seat
where Frodo has his vision?

     In another 5-10 years, when virtual sets have been further perfected,
to real three-dimension realism, you might be able to do the show for
something short of the national budget.  And then it might become feasible
for the networks to try.  Maybe.  You'd have to do it over a period of
six years, one year per half-book.  Otherwise there's just way too much
in the way of shifting locations.

     I'm just not sure if LoTR *should* be done for TV.  Perhaps some
things should remain sacrosanct.

                                                                  jms

     RE: maximum speed...obviously there's no maximum save for
the speed of light, but there's a maximum of what any particular
vessel can travel. There is a maximum speed that the Pioneer
can travel, or the space shuttle. So there is a similar cap on
Starfury accelleration.  I'm not sure I see what your concern is here.

     "Either way, "speed" does not in any way equal "thrust," folks."

     Sorry.  It does.

     The maximum thrust your ship can give you is equal to the maximum
speed your ship can travel, particularly since fuel is finite.  Given
an infinite amount of fuel, and infinite amounts of time, you can build
up a pretty good head of steam.  But Starfuries have neither.

     Maximum thrust results, short-term, in maximum speed.  The rest is
quibbling over semantics.  And pilots are notable for using shorthand.
They may not say, "Utilize F15 rocket engines to maximum thrust."  They
may say, "Hit it!"

     If maximum thrust provides the top speed your ship can travel, then
maximum speed is perfectly acceptable, and interchangeable.  (And we
generally use thrust anyway.)

                                                                   jms

     The credit chits work differently depending on who you are.  If
you work for B5, your salary is tied into your credit chit, and you
pay accordingly.  If you're a visitor from elsewhere, bringing in
non-Earth currency, you exchange that currency (as Aldous noted
in "Grail"), much as you do now.  Difference is, you turn in the currency
at the B5 exchange.  It is processed on the current rate of exchange,
and you are issued a credit chit programmed with an amount equal to
whatever you brought in.  You use it the same way as a credit card,
until it runs out, then it's rejected until you "recharge" it by
exchanging more currency.

     It's also tied into your identicard, which has every available fact
about you.

     Interestingly enough, I just saw an article in, I believe, WIRED,
which noted that Sweden had just launched on a program of using this
exact same device, same system, on a trial basis.

And I tend to keep an eye on various discussions.  I've been
tracking the Voyager talks for a while now.  (And BTW, if for
no other reason than it was co-created by Jeri Taylor, I wish
the show nothing but success.  Let's clarify that from the git-go.)
And I've seen a lot of people, not necessarily you, I'm just
thinking out loud and your message was in front of me when I
started to do so...saying "Let's keep an open mind, give the show
a chance, don't belittle it without seeing it, exercise tolerance."

     I also recognize names...and quite a few of those names (again,
I'm not directing this at you) are the same folks who've said that
Babylon 5 would be crap before it aired...and who refuse to watch it,
or even give it a chance....

     As Kelsey said in "Mind War," "There are rules...and then there

     Here is one other way, responding to that thread of your message,
in which B5 differs in the area of merchandise.

     You mention, correctly, that Richard Arnold read and approved all
the ST stuff...comics, novels, whatever.

     I work directly with DC on the comics line.  I approve artwork,
stories, script and cover art.  I work directly with Dell Books on
the B5 novels, approving outline, cover art, and full novels.  (I'm
currently about 1/2 through John Vornholt's first B5 novel, and hope
to get my notes -- minimal, it's a good book -- back to Dell by the end
of the coming week.)

     The result of this is that there won't ever be the mountain of
licensing on B5 that you've come to associate with ST.  Which is fine.
I wouldn't want that much.  What there is, has to be consistent in tone
and quality with everything else.  This is a story, not a franchise.

     I've spoken before of Norman Corwin.  For those who might've missed
it, Norman Corwin is one of the finest writers that this country has ever
produced.  At the height of the radio drama age, there was no one better
or bigger...not Orson Welles or Arch Oboler.  Nobody.

     He has been an inspiration to countless writers.  Charles Kuralt. Rod
Serling.  Ray Bradbury (who began his career trying to write like Norman).
He is, not to put too fine a point on it, a writer's writer. He is the
wellspring from which many of our finest writers can trace their origin.
Speaking as one tiny trickle in this momentous flood, I can certify his
influence on my own work.

     Some have commented on the style of writing in Babylon 5, and in some
of my previous work.  While much can be laid at the feet of Harlan Ellison,
much of my influence can also be traced to Norman Corwin, who taught me not
just how to write, but what it meant to BE a writer.  I cannot commend his
work to you highly enough.  If you have a love of language, of a story well
told, of fiction with a conscience and a point of view, then Norman's your
man.  Some of you may remember "A Prayer for the 70s," written by Norman,
which I posted a while back. A work of absolute genius, in a career peppered
with awards, and recognition by the U.N. and others.

     Many of you have asked for more information about Norman's work. To
that end I offer the following information:

     Norman has a new book out, that is just hitting the stands.  It is
entitled NORMAN CORWIN'S LETTERS, edited by A. J. Langguth.  It's in
hardcover from Barricade Books, ISBN #0-9623032-5-9.  It is an amazing
volume, full of inspiration and humor and the occasional thunder-and-lightning.

     You will find letters to and from such notables -- friends of Norman's
-- as Carl Sandburg, Ray Bradbury, Bette Davis, Stanley Kramer, Groucho
Marx, Greer Garson, Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas, Edward R.
Murrow, Anthony Quinn, Rod Serling, Leonard Bernstein, Erik Barnouw,
Archibald MacLeish, Stan Freberg, Walter Cronkite, Norman Cousins, Studs
Terkel, Eric Sevareid, Philip Dunne, Bill Moyers, Gregory Peck...the list
goes on and on.

     The letters are documents of a life, funny and outraged and thoughtful...
and beautifully written beyond my capacity to describe it to you.  If you
are a writer, or interested in writing, I can commend no book to you higher
than this one.

     If as a Babylon 5 viewer you'd like to get a better grasp of what
inspired me to pursue my career, and has helped make that dream a reality...
I recommend to you the works of Norman Corwin, starting with this book.

     If you need any further encouragement to go out *today* and get a copy
of this book, then let me simply suggest that you call up a copy of Who's
Who, and look up who Norman Corwin is.  I don't think you'll need additional
encouragement thereafter.

I help edit called "Continuous Future Experience" which is a pop culture
thingee about stuff we (meaning my editor in chief and other writers)
like.  Anyway, thought you'd get a kick out of it in light of the current
"Boring B5" discussion. (disclaimer:  this is meant to be humourous)

Top Ten Reasons Why *Real* Science Fiction Fans Don't Like Babylon 5
by Ian Prydon

1. It's not "Classic" Star Trek.
2. It's not Star Trek: The Next Generation.
3. It's not Star Trek: Deep Space Nine.
4. It's not as good as Star Trek: Voyager is going to be.
5. It's not Doctor Who.
6. It's not Blake's 7.
7. It's not Star Trek: The Animated Series.
8. There aren't enough half dressed buxom babes to keep my interest.
   And the girls they have on there are too smart.
9. There aren't any Klingons, Romulans, Vulcans, Cardassians
   or Ferengis on the show.
10. I don't get most of the plots. And they don't even explain everything
    by the end of the program.
11. There isn't any neat merchandising stuff to spend my money on.

The author did that intentionally.  Just a little test to see who
is awake out there. :-D  The other test is the author's name itself.
Eventually, I'm planning on writing a critical review of B5 Season 1
but right now I'm trying to finish an article on how all 7 seasons
of ST:TNG were like a brontosaurus; very thin at one end, very thick
in the middle and then thin again at the end. (honest)

Continous Future Experience, the soon to be launched newsletter
my friend and I are editing.  Just another desktop publication,
but we're trying to have fun with it.  As I mentioned in my last
post, it's just a pop culture newsletter about 'stuff we like'.
And what our writers like, too.  Some of it will be serious
and some of it goofy, like the top 10 list.  It's kind of surreal
since several of the writers will actually be writing columns
as different personas.  If you'd like, is there a snail mail address
for Babylonian Productions?  I'll make sure you're on the mailing list.

BABYLON 5: HOMAGE, OR PLAGIARISM? #812629
FROM: J MICHAEL STRACZYNSKI
DATE: MON SEP 5, 1994 4:47:14

     To deal with your points one by one...may I first suggest widening
your reading background a bit.  I'm amazed that you can say, of "regular
signals repeated at specific intervals" that this is a steal from ALIENS.
I would suggest that you do some reading in the SETI literature; this is
the first test for detecting a communications signal from space.  There
are monitoring stations set up all over the place listening for just this
kind of signal. Not ALIENS, just plain old science.

     RE: missiles...many people here and on other nets asked if we would
see missiles in an episode of B5; they said they were tired of everything
just being beams.  So I opted to use missiles.  They are a perfectly valid
means of defense.  They had nothing to do with HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE.

     Actually, Norman is still with us, and working every bit as much
and as hard as ever.  He has a second book coming out in about a month,
part of the Directors Guild oral-history series, based on a bunch of
interviews they conducted with him.  At age 84, he can still write
rings around nearly everyone else in the business.

BABYLON 5: JUMP GATES #811966
DATE: SUN SEP 4, 1994 6:18:11

     Travel from point A to point B takes some amount of time.  But when
you're near your destination, you can wait in hyperspace and choose to
come out at a specific moment.  There's considerable speculation that
both the Minbari and Vorlons have ships standing by in hyperspace, at
various locations, in case they're needed quickly.  (In the pilot movie,
Laurel Takashima even mentions that they are probably doing this.)  It's
a correlation to the TOT (Time On Target) philosophy; you can send ships
in from various sectors, have them lurk in hyperspace, then all come out
at once.

                                                                  jms

DATE: MON SEP 5, 1994 12:12:24

     Actually, T.O.T. comes from 20th century nuke technology.  The
origins of this come from the need to sometimes launch ICBMs at
staggered intervals, but on a launch and flight vector such that
they all land at the same time, for greatest impact.

BABYLON 5: ALIENS #811978
DATE: SUN SEP 4, 1994 6:34:03

     We've had other kinds of aliens, including the CGI creature
in "Grail," and we're doing more non-humanoid stuff in year two,
mixing prosthetics with CGI.

     What you have to understand, though, is that if you're going
to have a character BE a character, alien or not, you've basically
got two choices: put a human actor in makeup of some kind or other,
or you use puppets or animatronics, and in general the technology
to realize that still isn't enough to make it really lifelike.

     Also, interestingly enough, I spoke to a lot of folks who know
biology and genetics and have an interest in xenobiology...and what
they said was that the basic humanoid configuration is the ideal one
from an evolutionary standpoint.  Logically, you need minimum two hands
to grasp, and an opposable thumb (or two) to utilize tools; you want
your sensors at the highest part of your body in order to detect prey
and predators; you'll want legs instead of crawlers to run away from
predators more effectively, and because lower motor areas such as legs
are useful in controlling elements of technology; two legs are more
useful than four for getting through narrow areas and being more limber....

     The analysis goes on, but you get the idea.  And just as one last
thought in your direction...whatever one may think of UFO sightings,
you'll note that all of them have been of humanoid shapes, not one
slithering BEM in the bunch.

                                                                jms
BABYLON 5: ALIENS #812143
DATE: MON SEP 5, 1994 12:12:28

     Which is exactly the point...alien life forms conceived in
fiction novels can be as strange as you want.  You can do anything.
You can have a conversation with sentient pocket lint if you like.
The question becomes, what's practical and do-able in a visual medium?
What works on the page does not necessarily work on the stage.

DATE: MON SEP 5, 1994 12:18:14

     I'm with you.  I just turned 40, and have a comics habit to the tune
of $30-$40 per week.  To anyone who still thinks comics are for kids, I
would heartily recommend SANDMAN by Neil Gaiman (separate from Sandman
Mystery title, done by Matt Wagner, which is great, but may not be as
accessible). Neil does some amazing stuff.  Ditto Frank Miller, currently
publishing in MARTHA WASHINGTON GOES TO WAR.  The form is really coming
into its own.

we stand between the darkness, and the light."

STAR TREK: VOYAGER - MONEY #811965
DATE: SUN SEP 4, 1994 6:18:04

     One thing we have in common is that we're both fans of SF.  And like
you, I've largely felt disappointed by TV-SF in the past.  Which was one
reason for wanting to try it myself.

     Generalizing this discussion past my own show and ST for a moment,
I think there's some cause for hope.  One of the reasons, perhaps *the*
primary reason, why much of the prior SF shows have been less than they
could've been, or hooked around a gimmick rather than character stuff,
is that they were generally cobbled together by people who didn't know
the genre, didn't respect the genre.

     Now we're entering a period where folks like George RR Martin and
Melinda Snodgrass and Michael Cassutt and others who are SF literate
are getting into positions where they can run shows.  And I think that,
with time, this will further increase the amount and quality of TV SF.

                                                                  jms

     As well as the transport Marie Celeste, the new B5 Earthforce Club

                                                                   jms
BABYLON 5: "CREDIT" CARDS #811560
DATE: SAT SEP 3, 1994 11:19:12

     The credit chits work differently depending on who you are.  If
you work for B5, your salary is tied into your credit chit, and you
pay accordingly.  If you're a visitor from elsewhere, bringing in
non-Earth currency, you exchange that currency (as Aldous noted in
"Grail"), much as you do now.  Difference is, you turn in the currency
at the B5 exchange.  It is processed on the current rate of exchange,
and you are issued a credit chit programmed with an amount equal to
whatever you brought in.  You use it the same way as a credit card,
until it runs out, then it's rejected until you "recharge" it by
exchanging more currency.

     It's also tied into your identicard, which has every available fact
about you.

     Interestingly enough, I just saw an article in, I believe, WIRED,
which noted that Sweden had just launched on a program of using this
exact same device, same system, on a trial basis.

                                                                 jms
BABYLON 5: BORING B5 #811565
DATE: SAT SEP 3, 1994 11:31:24

     Here is one other way, responding to that thread of your message,
in which B5 differs in the area of merchandise.

     You mention, correctly, that Richard Arnold read and approved all
the ST stuff...comics, novels, whatever.

     I work directly with DC on the comics line.  I approve artwork,
stories, script and cover art.  I work directly with Dell Books on
the B5 novels, approving outline, cover art, and full novels.  (I'm
currently about 1/2 through John Vornholt's first B5 novel, and hope to
get my notes -- minimal, it's a good book -- back to Dell by the end
of the coming week.)

     The result of this is that there won't ever be the mountain of
licensing on B5 that you've come to associate with ST.  Which is fine.
I wouldn't want that much.  What there is, has to be consistent in
tone and quality with everything else.  This is a story, not a franchise.

                                                                     jms

BABYLON 5: PRISONER STYLE END? #812651
DATE: MON SEPT 5, 1994 5:04:28

     There are guarantees short of the grave.

     That said...I think the ending for the B5 storyline is pretty cool.

     That said...I don't think it's really about the ending.  The ending
is simply where the story finally stops.  Look at the ending of THE LORD
OF THE RINGS.  Frodo back in the shire (though not entirely the same shire
it was when he left), glad that it's all over.

     The climax of the story isn't always the same as the end of the story.
The climax of LoTR would be when the ring is returned to the fire, and
destroyed, in my view.  Others might say that Aragorn being returned as
the kind would be the climax.  The fact is there's SO much going on in
those books that it's hard to pick any one as being *the* climax.

     In THE PRISONER, it was all centered on one question: will he or
will he not get off the island, and who's behind it?  (Okay, that's two
questions, but they're associated.)  B5 isn't built around ANY one question.
It has a lot of different pieces and threads, each with their own arc,
like LoTR.  Look at the LENSMAN books.  Same thing.

     Will you be satisfied by the ending?  More to the question, are you
being satisfied by the beginning, and the journey so far?  That's the more
telling question.  B5 is more about the journey than the destination, though
you have to craft one hell of a climax and a solid ending nonetheless.

     You're also asking us to make a subjective decision that really
only you can make.  You didn't like the ending of THE PRISONER.  I
think it's nifty.  It's obvious that some stuff was thrown in just to
get weird; but a lot of it wasn't, and you really have to sit down and
parse through the thing to get maximum meaning out of it.  It's not as
absurd as it looks.

     Watch the show for as long as you enjoy the journey.

                                                                       jms
BABYLON 5: PRISONER STYLE END? #814081
DATE: WED SEPT 7, 1994 
     I've had occasion to talk to a number of people who were involved
in the production of THE PRISONER, and there's one very interesting aspect
they give to the events.

     What they say is that #6 resigned *expecting* to get kidnapped,
that he had heard about the Village, and protested, and deliberately
put himself in the position of being taken there in order to prove
his thesis: that the whole value of the thing could be proven worthless
if even *one man* was able to defy what was supposed to be an unbreakable
and inescapeable system. So there was really no mystery about why he
resigned, except among the lower level flunkies...but they wanted him to
*say* it, to prove they could break him.

     (Further proof to this theory is in the main titles, the way
he drives and never looks back, despite being followed...when the gas
enters his room, he looks up and just for a second, there's a very definite
smile on his face, a "good, let's get on with it, then" expression.  His
glance out the window, almost a knowing, parting glance...then away.)

     And so, at the end, he has proven his point.  The unbreakable machine
is broken, its usefulness destroyed.  Unless he should choose to join it
and run it, his resolution *not* to be broken being strong enough probably
to break anyone else like him.  But he refuses, and when he does so,
it all comes apart.

     The irony, of course, being that once he's back, and he enters
his own apartment...the door opens and closes automatically, just like
in the Village...implying that when you come down to it, we're *all*
in the Village every day, all of us.

                                                                   jms

     Sorry, I'm not going to let you run this number on me.  I have been
on line and receiving criticism -- good and bad -- since the pilt went on
the air.  And agreeing with much of it.  I've taken *immense* amounts of
criticism.

     What bothered me in the message, and what you didn't address, is
the difference between a *criticism* and an *allegation*.  Look at the
header of this message.  HOMAGE OR PLAGIARISM.  Had the header read,
simply, HOMAGE? I wouldn't have had a problem.  But what it says -- and
again, words have meaning -- is "Is this a tribute, or is it theft?"
There is a quantum difference between criticism, and accusing someone of
a crime.

     For some reason, some people just leap to this.  David Gerrold had
to fend off the allegations that he ripped off Peter David's novel.  Some
people think that if there is any similarity in theme, it has to be theft.
And they're too quick to throw around terms like plagiarism without
understanding what they are saying, and what the impact is.  And then when
they get called on it, they say the person's being defensive and doesn't
want criticism...as you just did.

     Wrong.  It's not a matter of God jumping on anybody.  I'm sorry, but
I see 500 messages a day, most of them with a suggestion or a criticism.
I don't jump on people unless there's a reason.  I've been here on this
forum talking about this a long time, and the people here know that.  The
day you can wade through 500 messages a day dissecting what YOU do for
a living, then you can come talk to me about being open to criticism.

worked on the thing.

     Actually, yes, I did read the DC book...but for the life of me,
I can't remember the precise storyline.  I remember he was there, had
come back, was older...but beyond that, it's just fallen out of my head.

     Thanks.  I love Patrick's work.  Problem is he's *very* fussy on the
roles he takes.  (And justifiably so.)  He has to be sold on the script or
there's no deal.  We'd sent him a copy of "And the Sky Full of Stars,"
which would have had him as the main interrogator, Knight Two...and he liked
it, and was prepared to do it...when we checked our respective calendars
and discovered that he was going to be out of the country when we were
scheduled to shoot.

     We hope to get him at some later time.  He's just terrific.

     My favorite books when growing up: the Lord of the Rings trilogy,

     Thanks.  I've had a long time to think about what I want to do with
the story, and that's what I've *always* wanted to do...something that
would be in the spirit of the great, huge, sprawling sagas that I grew up
reading. As far as individual stories are concerned...when you've got
characters as interesting as G'Kar and Delenn and Ivanova and all the rest
(and now Sheridan), it's easy to come up with stories for them...and very
hard to make them shut up once they start talking in a scene.  They pretty
much just take over and start running around causing havoc....

     Just curious (how could I not be after that?) how the photo differed
from the perception based on the work.  I'll say that the photo isn't the
best of me, not because of the photographer, who was fine, but because
I was just sorta walking by one day, dressed real casual, frumpy shirt,
when I was asked if I'd sit for one.

BABYLON 5: B5 CAST ANNOUNCEMENT #815051
DATE: THURS SEP 8, 1994 12:18:11

     Replacing Sinclair?  No, not precisely.  Boxleitner's character,
Captain John Sheridan, is coming aboard B5 as its now commanding officer,
but Sinclair isn't gone permanently.  He is being moved off the chessboard
for a time, allowing us to broaden out the story, and give Michael the
chance to pursue some interests of his own in the meantime.  Sinclair will
return from time to time as the story requires.  (There's a lengthy message
in library 13 here with more details.)

                                                                       jms

     Frankly, in the long run, I'm *much* happier with Chris Franke.
Stewart was more of the "let's make a library of music and draw from it
and remix a lot" school.  Nothing wrong with that, lots of shows do it.
Chris, on the other hand, uses *very* little library stuff; each episode
is scored individually, and the music is lush, driving, powerful.  I
couldn't be happier.

     You can have the Sun reporter contact me through Warner Burbank.

     Typical, though....

     And now perhaps you can see what it's like; they're always asking you
to prove what makes you different from Star Trek.  Why should they think
we're the SAME as Star Trek?  To many reporters, it's all the same thing,
which is depressing.  How does the producer of NYPD prove that his show is
different from Picket Fences?  *They're just not the same show*.

     Anyway, I enjoyed working with you for the full totality of five
minutes.

     Too bad; at six minutes you'd've started getting residuals.

BABYLON 5: "BELIEVERS" #817504
DATE: SAT SEP 10, 1994 2:43:08 AM

     How Ivanova got away from the Raiders was taking advantage of
her lead to run away, occasionally firing backward to deter pursuit,
until she got to the jumpgate.  It wasn't really anything dramatically
interesting, and at that point you would start distracting from the
main plot...and that couldn't be allowed to happen.  There's really
noplace in the rest of the act where you can cut in without destroying it.
And in the tag there's no room for the pursuit, only the arrival.

                                                                   jms

STAR TREK: BUJOLD WALKS-RUMOR? #818237
DATE: SAT SEP 10, 1994 8:55:02

     I don't understand why there's so much concern about whether or not
they can meet their airdate schedule.  There's still plenty of time.  We
began shooting the new season of B5 on August 11th, to go on the air
November 2nd.  That's just under 3 months, and we'll be delivering episodes
a few weeks before airing..  As of right now, there are 4 months between
now and January, Voyager's debut.  If they take another full month to find
a replacement, that's still more time than we took, so they should be fine.

                                                                    jms
STAR TREK: BUJOLD TOO BOLDLY GOES! #818238
DATE: SAT SEP 10, 1994 8:55:07
     Let me just jump in here on the "say each line word for word" issue that you keep throwing around.  The notion of how much actors improvise on TV is *grossly* exaggerated.  I have not worked on any show yet in which the actor is allowed to just change lines or wordings on set without first getting permission from the story editor or producer.

     The reason for this is very simple: episodes are not shot in order
of scenes, but in order of location (i.e., all the mess hall shots are
done in there, then you move the camera crew to another location, and
you do all those scenes, then you interweave them in editing).  It's
VERY easy to lose track if you're shooting that way, and you can change
a line in scene 9, from "He said it's the absolute truth" to "He said
he wasn't lying," not realizing that *another* character in another
scene has already said, or will say, "Like Mike said, it's the absolute
truth," and now those two scenes don't match.  Meaning you now have to
go in and edit around it and loop the dialogue.

     Sometimes an actor may not fully realize that there's a clue, or
a particular line that must be repeated.  So the rule on EVERY show
that I've ever worked on -- particularly the more technical ones --
have the same rule: absolutely NO changes allowed on set without
consultation with the story editor/producer(s).  That's the rule on B5,
Murder She Wrote, the Twilight Zone...on and on and on.

     There's this contemporary mythology that actors get up there and
start improvising and adlibbing, and that somehow ST is an aberration
for not allowing that.  Simply not true.  You have bought into the
trap of accepted cliche and misinformation.

                                                                 jms

DATE: SUN SEP 11, 1994 2:02:10 AM

     I have no direct contact with the day-to-day operations at ST,
and if there's one thing that I've learned from the occasional sarcasm
and rumor mongering and speculation attendant upon the modification
in B5 casting, it's that such speculation is invariably wrong, and hurtful,
and cynical, and thus nothing much is gained by my contributing to it.

                                                                       jms

     I *believe* that only the first batch of episodes, up to but not
including "Believers," are Hugo eligible for next year, due to the dates
on which they were broadcast.  (There's a cutoff somewhere in there on
eligibility, so later ones will have to be for the 1996 Hugos.)  Perhaps
someone out there can provide the specific dates for eligibility for the
1995 Hugos.  I think the only real biggies eligible from the first part
of the season would be "Mind War" and "And the Sky Full of Stars," but
someone out there may know better.
