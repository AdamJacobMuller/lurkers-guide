     It took, literally, months of trial and error, design and
redesign, which is why  we did it as the last episode of that

     Borderlands Press will not be doing the trade paperback
because it did not  have the final rights to do so, and other
problems during the production of the  book -- the high number
of typos and errors made that delayed the book's  publication
-- led to the rights being taken elsewhere.

      {Regarding Majel Barrett Roddenberry going back into

      I'd just like to say that Majel did a great job for us
on B5, and we are hoping  we can come up with other opportuni-
ties for the character to return.  I know that  Majel is
interested in pursuing other acting gigs outside ST, and I
wish her all the  best.  I think other shows would do well to
utilize her abilities; everyone had a  great time working with
her, and she should be recognized for work other than  ST.

       Perhaps folks should let the producers of other shows
know that she's  available now, and interested, and that
they'd like to see her appear on other  shows from time to
time.  (Maybe someone could drop the folks at X-Files of 
Space a note in their forums....)

From:  C Clark                      #424744

This Message, by Kevin Freels, was posted to the RASTB5
newsgroup a few  days ago and I repost it here with permis-
sion.

If Dr. Suess had written for Babylon 5....

(...Intro music starts up when 
we see the network of P-TEN...)

We live here on Bab'lon 5
to keep our last great hope alive.
So far, it seems, since Season One,
The war of Shadows has begun.
So victory now is what we need
if Bab'lon Five is to succeed!

This Minbari, she's Delenn.
She speaks in riddles now & then.
She has a bone upon her head.
She'd rather have some hair instead.

Delenn:
"Hi there! Ho there! My old friend!
It's nice to see you once again.
Come, let's talk of Councils Gray,
And Crystal candles as we pray.
I live here on Bab'lon Five
To keep our last great hope alive."

This is Delenn's friend, Lennier.
You may ask, "Why is he here?
He looks familiar! I know his face!
He used to be on 'Lost in Space'!".
Just like her, he's real verbose,
And smells like fish-heads when you're up close.

Londo:
"I am Londo, tall and proud!
(though some might say that I'm too loud!)
I'm Centauri, so you see.
My hair defies all gravity.
We Centauri will someday rule.
(Actually, we're just a tool.
The Shadows really run the game.
Alas! Such is the price of fame!)
I like women, game, and drink.
I drink and drink 'till I can't think!
I live here on Bab'lon Five
To keep my ego hopes alive.

This is my assistant, Vir."

Vir:
"I would like--"

Londo:      "Get out of here!"

This green lizard is G'Kar.
He has come from very far.

G'Kar:
"I'm not a lizard! I'm a Narn!
Time is crucial! I must warn!
We're all in danger! Londo's nuts!
His henchmen shadows kicked our butts!
They've driven us down to our knees!
Send lawyers, guns and money, please!
Ion cannons! Ruby lasers!
Even dusty Star Trek phasers!"

This is Kosh. He gives me creeps!
He barely speaks, just whirrrs & beeps.

Kosh:
*clakkity* *clakkity*!! *whirrr* *buzz* Beep!
"You've always been here!" *ka-chunk* *gleep*!

He always says that in fog-like scenes.
I still don't know just what it means!
He wears that suit to hide from us.
Does he wear it on the bus?

Garibaldi:
"They're all guilty! Every one!
I'll bust 'em up to have some fun!
I'll bring in those bad beserkers,
All those liars, thieves and lurkers."

He's my Chief Security.
Testosterone flows in him free.
He's pretty edgy. I know why.
Since Mars was home, well, he's been dry.
He's really hyper, so I think.
But imagine if he had a drink!

This is Susan--

Ivanova:
             "As you were!
I'm Ivanova! And call me 'Sir'!
I'm delicate, on one small side,
But touch me and I'll tan your hide!
And though to you I might appeal,
I once faked sex to clinch a deal.
So stand your post and keep your ground,
Or, I promise, you I'll pound."

Meet the Doctor. He stays up late,
And works for forty hours straight!

Dr. Franklin:
"I heal aliens, those are my jobs.
Humans and Martians, Reptiles and Blobs! 
Wozzles and Snangles and Bug-eyed Kertunkers!
Yellow-faced insects with Red-winged Dondunkers!
Centauri! Membari! Vorlons and Narn!
I'd even help creatures made out of yarn!
So I will stay living on Bab'lon Five
To keep all these strange little creatures alive!"

Talia's a telepath.
She once followed in our path.
But a time-bomb in her mind
Has made her evil and unkind.
It's doubtful she can be our friend.
Our trust in her is at an end.

The Psi-corp has a man named Bester.
He could be labled "Mind Molester".
He's evil, mean, and nasty, too!
He can read the thoughts of you.
We must give him credit, tho.
He drove a starship years ago.

Bester:
"I've known your kind and what to do.
So I'll be back. Be seeing you."

This man Morden, standing here.
He is one that you should fear.
He has shadows for his brothers.
He doesn't play so well with others.

---

So that's my story. It's lonely here.
We're so far out, there is no beer.

I'm stuck out here on Bab'lon Five
To keep our last great hope alive.
I'm stuck out here, it's just not fair!
It's all the fault of that Sinclair!
He bailed out, I took the fall,
And now he won't return my call!

But...

It could be worse, it's just five years.
Or I could have Ferengi ears.
And when all is said and done,
I'm not Harlan Ellison!

     Funny thing is, some mathematicians disagree with this
assessment; no,  there was no year 0, but there was a year 10
and 20 and 30 and so on (though  all, as you note, assigned in
retrospect).  So some of them have taken the  position that
the first century was simply short one year, rather than
rolling every  other century back one year.

     Once again you make broad statements: "none of the cast
members have  done the talk show circuit."  Not correct. 
Bruce has done the Stephanie Miller  show, showed up on the
Tonight Show, the Mike and Maddie show (same there  for Jerry
Doyle, who's done other talk shows including several network
morning  shows, such as the the FX cable network show),
they've all done various national  radio shows, and other talk
shows.

     So for starters you're not correct; they're doing some,
and we're working on  doing more.  The problem is that most
talk shows want major, recognized stars  from hit network
shows, and syndication doesn't get a lot of attention there.

civilizations.  First you have to  explore them, and set them
up as real, individual forces. Second, it becomes  easy to
say, "Well, I don't have to think about this particular issue,
it's just an alien  thing.  Isn't it interesting that they
should feel this way?"  It's more effective in  some way to
make the *really* challenging issues ones that directly

     "...never once did he (Harlan) disown that effort (`City 
on the Edge of Forever')...."

     The only thing wrong with that statement is that it 
isn't true.

     Harlan only kept his own name on City after Roddenberry 
pleaded with him to do so; further, it was Harlan's *original* 
script, not the rewrite, that earned the Writers Guild of 
America award that year...and, in fact, he has *always* 
maintained in print, and in every interview that he's given, 
that he is in no way responsible for the televised version.  
You are, basically, repeating a canard that Gene repeated at 
cons, that was not in any way, manner, shape or form the 
truth.

     If you want to get the documented facts in this case, not 
the mythos that's grown up around it, I suggest you get the 
Borderlands Press version of "City," which includes memos, all 
versions of the script and outline, and afterwords by Nimoy, 
Kelley, Koenig, Takai and others involved in the episode.

     There've been discussions about a DTV project, a one-off, but 
nothing's set yet.  The ratings are doing well; the reason some 
(not many) stations have time-shifted the show to later hours is 
that independent stations only have 2 hours per night of prime 
time, 8-10 p.m., doing news at 10.  More and more they're tied up 
with pre-set agreements with Fox, UPN and WB, so anything else has 
to get put into later slots.

      Well, any time you move to a later slot it's going to affect 
the numbers.  As for WB moving the show into later slots for 
purposes alleged in a fanzine...for starters, WB has *zero* control 
over where the stations run the show.  It's all determined locally.  
So for starters the story is bogus. Second, on the "expensive" 
line, our episodes cost just under $900,000 per, as opposed to $1.2 
to $1.6 million per episode (or more) on DS9 and Voyager. Work it out.

     You just have to brace yourself for the work, and burn through 
it by being somewhat monomanaical and obsessive.  It takes a toll, 
but in the end, it is or should be worth it, otherwise why do it?

     I've gotten used to handling work and deadlines, so it really 
doesn't bother me too much, unless I'm really under the gun.  Thus 
far, I've written something like 170 *produced* TV scripts, maybe 
a bit more, and by the end of this season will have written 49 B5 
scripts.  This season, in writing 22 episodes, not counting first 
drafts and revisions which would double the figure easily, I'll 
have written about 1,000 pages in less than 10 months. That's two 
full-sized novels.

     I try not to think about that too much....

     Not only did "Messages From Earth" come out as well as I'd 
hoped or thought it would, it came out *better*.  It is, 
potentially, either one of the best or the best thing we've ever 
done in the whole series to date. There are some episodes that 
come close this season, like "Point of No Return," "A Late 
Delivery From Avalon," "Sic Transit Vir" (for absolutely different 
reasons), and parts of "Dust to Dust," but so far -- at least until 
the CGI for "Severed Dreams" is finished, which has at least a shot 
at knocking "Messages" out of the box -- "Messages" is as close to 
perfect as we've ever come.

     Like "The Coming of Shadows" there's a real sense of a *story* 
being told, and major events happening at breakneck speed.  It's 
just a joy to watch.

   <I've seen messages where you explained what your position is on 
the Death Penalty versus Life Imprisonment. I was wondering, if the 
technology of Mindwiping was available, would you be in favour of 
it?>

     I actually don't know how I'd stand on that...to render the 
argument correctly in the show, I've had to "convince" myself on 
both sides of the issue.  When it happens for real, I'll have an

    <I was listening to Laurie Anderson's CD ("The Ugly one with the

wonder if you had the CD, or had heard it??
    Apart from the weird voice modulation (not too unlike Kosh) which 
she calls her "Voice of Authority", she also recounts a story where a 
little girl is told by her nutty/psychic/religious aunt that doomsday 
is coming and that the world will end "In Fire!". (These two words 
being given in the musical 'Voice'.) There may have been a few other 
oddities, but these stuck out.

     1.  I am very interested in the military in B5, what
     they are doing?

All kinds of things.  Some good, some not so.

     Does the Earth Alliance military simply follow the
     President, or does the Admiralty have its own mind?

Any military must respect the chain of command.  You can't have the
military setting its own agenda.  The president proposes, the military
disposes.

     Will the EA do anything that the Senators and President
     says?

Well, the EA military must obey the President as Commander in Chief. 
The EA government is always quibbling.  They're like that.

     What does the EA military feel about the loss of its
     telepaths?

The EA military hasn't lost any telepaths that I know of.  Don't know
what this refers to.

     What does the EA military think about the station B5?

"Cushy job.  And they're a bunch of loose cannons over there.  Maybe
we better see if we can help straighten things out."

     You basically said the Manbire military is under the
     control of the shadow (rather simple view I know) is
     the earth military the same way?

No, I never said that, and the Minbari are NOT under Shadow control.

     My next question is on getting your show on military
     T.V.  The network is called AFARTS, Armed Forces
     A(something) Radio and Television something something.

     Anyway, AFARTS does not show commercials. After not
     seeing stateside commercials for over 5 years, you
     actually start missing them, anyway, they don't do
     advertisements, and basically ask for the show.  DS9,
     Bay watch etc. either give it to AFARTS or gives it to
     them for next to nothing.

     I was wondering if you were even willing to enterin the
     ideal.  If so, we have to start a write in "beg
     campaign" to get worthless AFARTS (actually they are
     O.K., but it is a sailors right to complain) to talk to
     someone.  Last big thing was getting the Rush Limbaugh
     show, on the radio, that had to go to congress, before
     the FoB plants/sympatiers in the pentagon/Admiralty
     would allow it.

I'm up for it, we've talked to Warners about it, but it's their call,
not mine.

     The military uses telepaths on a loan-out or special intelligence
basis, rather than within the core units of soldiers and officers.

Subject: New Stuff

       As y'all know, next week the latest batch of new episodes
begins to air.  The first one up, "Voices of Authority," is an absolute
hoot; if you've been looking to bring in other viewers, that's a good
one to start them with, because it sets up a lot of what's going to
happen in this episode, it has a lot of background, and it's a lot of
fun.

       The next two are somewhat more straightforward, stand-alones
(to some extent; there's some arc stuff there, however, which becomes
more important later).  Then the last two in this batch represent some
of the best work we've ever done, "Messages From Earth" and "Point of
No Return."  They follow directly on the footsteps of "Voices," so
those three together would be great for new viewers.

       Second, today is Michael O'Hare's first day of shooting here on
the B5 stages for the two-parter, featuring his return to the station
from Minbar, and propels him into the center of attention for most of
the two parts. Everyone's having a great time so far, he and Bruce have
been hanging out a lot, and the episode should be a real toad-strangler
when it's finished.

                                                                  jms

     In most cases, the writer sends in a proposal to the book
company; they then send these proposals to me to see which a) I like,
and b) fit in with the storyline one way or another.  When the book is
commissioned, I work with the writer to one degree or another in
keeping things very much on track.  In the case of this book, I
actually did very little until the actual manuscript came in, at which

     No, only once has that been done, running "Hunter, Prey" in this
last batch to set up the new ones.  The rest of the time, reruns are
set up so that the stations have new shows to run in the sweeps periods
(February, May, (sometimes July), and November).

     Because we have to make the season 3 title sequence *very* early
in the shooting process; we need shots to go out in the first episode
title sequence, but we've only shot a few episodes by the time we need
to deliver. So most shots tend to come from the preceding season.

     Yes, I've heard this; we've always had trouble with that station
in terms of air schedules and availability of slots.  There's nothing
anyone can do about it at this end; only local pressure can make an
impact.  (And some of the worst offenders do the "low rated" argument
to cover the fact that they just have too many prior commitments to
other networks like UPN and/or FOX or WBN...or that they just don't
like the show for one reason or another.  Some shows have actually been
bought by stations and *shelved* because they didn't want to air it,
but at the same time didn't want anyone else in the market to air it
either.  (This happened to us on Twilight Zone on several occasions.)

                                                                  jms

     As I make the changes, in large measure I just keep it all in my
head, though a few things get written down and put on post-it notes
around my home office monitor.  It's like a number-cruncher program;
you make one change, hit return, and it incorporates all the
permutations of that change down the line. That's kind of what I do in
my head.  I change one item, let the ramifications ripple through it
all, and now it's all there.  By doing this every time I make a slight
modification, it lets me see what impact it may have down the line, so
I can avoid making any changes that seriously conflict with the larger
storyline.  It's a headache -- figuratively and literally -- but the 
effort of doing so keeps me on track.

     After that, it's mainly a process of remembering what happened; I
treat this as the history of the Babylon station.  This is what
"happened" in the universe I created in my head.

     Problem is, this occupies all the available RAM my brain seems to
contain.  I have zip memory for anything else that I can consider even
remotely expendable, like appointments, remembering to pick up dry
cleaning, bringing a magazine to a friend's house who'd requested a
copy of something, on and on.  If it ain't involved with B5, it just
slides outta my brain.

     Thanks.  The only problem with putting the title at the end of
the episode, in the closing credits, is that many stations chop off the
end credits altogether.  So it's best to have them in the beginning.

     "57th out of 75 shows."  Just to correct you: that figure is from
the Christmas period rerun, which was low for everybody, and second,
it's not out of 75 shows, that's usually just the top batch they list,
it's 57th that week out of 275 syndicated shows.  Usually we do in the
40s out of 275, which puts us in the top 20% of all syndicated shows.

     You can't do that; you can only have the title card once, because
SAG, DGA, WGA and other unions have rules that regulate where their
workers appear in relation to the title of the episode.  If you have it
twice, you mess that up.
