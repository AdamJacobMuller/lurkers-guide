      Yeah, that was our first Hugo...just sorta slipped it in with
Ivanova's other awards.  It was kind of a nod back to our fans...and I
think the first time that a Hugo has been shown on-screen in a series
that has *won* a Hugo.

The Drak and Centari Prime?

      Vir is Emperor now.  Londo asked Sheridan to free his people; we
can assume he did this...but we will also be showing this in the
Centauri Prime trilogy of books in more detail.

Londo?

      We saw Londo's fate in War Without End Part 2.

Lyta?

      The telepath crisis and events surrounding it will provide a lot
of the background to Crusade.

Bester and the Psi Corps?

      Ditto.

G'Kar?

      We saw his fate in WWE2 also.

Garibaldi and Bester?

      This will be covered in the Psi Corps trilogy, of which volume 1
is out now, and volume 2 is in my hands for editing.

B5's seemingly needless and useless destruction?

      Neither needless nor useless.  It was built cheapest of all the
stations, and it takes a lot of money to maintain it.  With trade
routes now going around it, there isn't enough income to support it. 
So do you leave it intact, for others to occupy or raid for weapons
systems and other systems too difficult to yank out?  Or take it out,
the same way we implode buildings now?

Sheridan's son - we guess he survived the Drak and their intended
keeper?

      This will also be covered in the Centauri Prime trilogy...but if
you sit back you can do some of the work to figure out a large part of
this. As Londo states, his situation in WWE2 (Sheridan and Delenn
captured on Centauri Prime) takes place 18 years after the events in
2260, which would put it at 2278. The urn, given to Sheridan in 2262,
is supposed to be given to the heir at the occasion of his/her 16th
birthday, by Centauri tradition.

      That would put the urn presentation at...ding!...2278.

      In 2278, Sheridan and Delenn have been drawn to Centauri Prime. 
We know their son is involved, because Delenn says "David is safe."  So
they were somehow able to save him, because we know that in 2281, David
is alive and well and serving in the Rangers (SiL).

      You can see the shape of the events there...once again the clues
are more or less in plain sight...but again, this will be drawn out in
the books in more detail.

                                                                  jms

      Understand: I get several HUNDRED messages a day.  Every day. 
Day in and day out.  Public and private.  I cannot reply to all of
them, and there is no requirement that I must reply to each of them. 
If I feel it requires a response, I do so; if not, I don't. 
Complaining about it to the forum is not the appropriate response.

      Thanks...and you're right on all counts.  Additionally, you have
to really decide *Who is the story about?*  You can really only track a
couple of characters to the end...here we tracked a number there or
nearly there. This story is a history -- told from a future perspective
 -- about the events of the Babylon station, and those who passed
through it, during a specific period in its history.

Subject: B5 franchise?

 T.P.Chai <104674.3064@compuserve.com> asks:
>  your comments?

      They're nitwits.

      Look...first off, nobody *has* to buy anything.  If you want to
learn more about the characters after the duration of the show, and you
want to buy the novels or whatever, fine, you have that option.  But
you didn't have to buy them to enjoy the series...and I'm working hard
to make sure you don't even have to have watched the series to enjoy
the novels.

      There are two fundamental choices here, given that fans want
more stuff in the B5 universe.  Either you do novels that have nothing
to do with anything, or you make them canon.  Fans wanted the books
canonical, as do I. That's the point of a coherent, consistent,
sustained universe.

      The Psi Corps novels, for instance, track Bester's life from
birth to death, and the development of the Corps.  Is that essential
reading to follow any of the B5 episodes?  No.  Is it cool if you want
to learn more about it and enrich the experience?  Yes.  So where here
is the problem?

      Look...some folks have always looked for an excuse to rag on
this show, so they could bug me and anybody who likes the show.  First
it was that B5 couldn't possibly be as good as Trek because there
wasn't any merchandise; now there's merchandise and they say now THAT
means it can't be good.

      If you never bought a single book or outside material, you could
still enjoy the series.  None of it is required.  So the complaint is
unjustified and silly.

      Should we not give fans of the show a chance to acquire more
info about the B5 universe and characters because a few folks complain
that it's a franchise?  Nonsense.  The problem is theirs, nobody
else's.

                                                                  jms

you'd have to bring B5 through a jump point in order to bring it

      It's an immense satisfaction to get it all done, and out the
door, when nobody thought it could be done.  Would I do it again?  I
don't know...I had no idea how hard this would be when I got into it. 
The only way it got done was that I didn't know it was impossible at
the time.  I think I would, though.

      If you've purchased a PPG, it's unlicensed.  And if the link
came from aywhere other than the official B5 fan club, that, too, is
unlicensed.  Just FYI.

"JMS, it is still "Crusade, the Babylon Project"? just wondering what
the "Babylon" is doing there if it doesn't deal with the station."

      It's just Crusade.

      Sonuvagun...thanks for the info.  I'd better go look at the
darned thing myself.  I've watched "In the Beginning" on disk, and
thought it looked gorgeous...practically a luminous copy, struck from
fresh masters.

      The intro movie, "A Call to Arms," is still slated for January
3rd; the series initiall was going to go in January, then they moved it
to June 2nd to make room for the NBA playoffs, and now that it looks
like the playoffs may not happen, I'm hearing March/April.

                                                                  jms

> *sigh* Any word on a possible DVD release?

"Even more than the weekday strip, *this* is the way the series was
made to be watched.  Without interruptions, without a 24 hour (still
less 7 day or several month) gap between episodes it becomes a whole
different experience. And the earliest episodes look different when
watched again after each season."

      This is pretty much the reaction of everyone who's sat and
watched the show through in a concentrated form; it's a whole other
show.  It's all contiguous, even when it looks like it ain't, and the
artificial breaks were pretty much ignored in the writing.

"This is a staggering achievement, especially within the confines of
American commercial television.  I don't think anyone yet realizes what
you've done here. And when they get the first dim glimmers of the idea,
and try to copy it, they'll only see the surface mechanics of a
continuing story and never see the sheer *work* that went into crafting
almost every line and gesture of each of each show so that it could pay
off two or three years down the road."

      I'm okay with that; I always said that B5 wouldn't really be
appreciated for what it is for several years down the line.  This is a
part of the reason for that.  It has to run through several times, and
become a part of the general consciousness, and be perceived for what
it is.

"This is the first series I've ever seen that *can't* be fully
appreciated the first time through.  Reruns aren't a commercial
byproduct of this show, in a curious way they are the point.  I'm
finally starting to see what you meant long ago when you mentioned a
"four dimensional hologram.""

      (Actually the term was holographic storytelling, but the point
obtains.) Usually, reruns are considered an aftermarket...here the show
was written with that in mind to some extent.  It was written for the
long haul, so to speak.

      I'll be very curious to see the perception of the show ten years
hence.

                                                                  jms

      The Gathering is, apparently, the TNT version on disk.
