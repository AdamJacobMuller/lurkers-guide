Subject: Scotty Fired

      Don't know if anyone's mentioned it yet, but since it's been in
the trades I thought people might want to know...apparently Paramount
was unhappy with Jimmy Doohan doing a part on Homeboys from Outer Space
(I think that's the title) that had a scottish accent and a mustache
and was kind of a parody of Scotty...and they pressured the production
company to terminate his contract.  And now he's off the show.

      It's hard enough for actors to find work on the best of days. 
But this sort of thing is just appalling.  If there are fans of Jimmy
Doohan's work who are less than thrilled with this heavy-handed
treatment (which has many folks in the Industry out here annoyed as
well; Bill Mumy was nearly speechless when he heard it) and who want to
note this with the studio, you're certainly free to do so.

                                                                  jms

      On very rare occasions you may get a shot where I look
relatively human, but they're few and far between.  The camera loves
Harlan, on the other hand, who always looks great in shots.  Me, every
time my photo comes out somewhere, America's Most Wanted gets calls....

"Is it true that each B5 season was planned for 26 eps instead of 22
in case one of the major networks picked it up?  A friend told me that
he heard this was the case and that there are a number of entire eps
that were written and filmed, but have never aired with no plan to air
them anytime soon.  Are there "lost" B5 eps that may surface some time

      Certainly I would never have made a big deal about the Ericsson
thing, because then it *does* set up certain expectations.  I didn't
hear about the promo until you did.

      There actually *was* a Lorien scene in that episode, but it got
slid a bit when we ran out of time in that ep.

      Thanks; we put in a LOT of time in the music and sound design of
the show, more than most shows.  I'm glad it shows.

      Ironically, though, the company doing the satellite uplink was
changed recently (we have no control over this) and they're now
uplinking the show in *analog* rather than digital, so there's some
frazzing now that limits the dynamic range just a tad.

                                                                  jms

Subject: Season 5 Cancelled?

{original post had no questions}

      It's really little to do with popularity or ratings...it's the
reality of PTEN no longer existing, and contracts being tied up in a
corporate tangle, and them trying to decide if they want the headache
of doing all this again. We still don't know anything for certain,
though, so all we can do is wait.

      Nothing about it was at all accidental...he had to go pick it
up, turn, move to Cartagia, stick it in, and then pull the trigger. 
Nothing accidental about it.  But if we'd shown him doing all the prep,
the shock wouldn't have been as substantial.

{original post unavailable}

      Sinclair was never intended to go to Z'ha'dum.

      And it wouldn't have worked for Sakai to be the one who awoke
the shadows and "died" at Z'ha'dum because *they were already awake* in
the first season.  People who try to lay the one line atop the other
tend to forget this.  We also get Garibaldi's mention of crawling out
of the Martian desert in the very first episode...which tied into the
whole Messages From Earth thread, putting the shadows at work for at
least 2-3 years.

                                                                  jms

      Re: heart/hearts...I figured that the two collectively are a
whole from an emotional or spiritual perspective.  We say "a pair of

      Part of the problem is that they've switched satellite uplink
services, so that now it's being uploaded in analog instead of digital,
and if it isn't absolutely calibrated, there's some left/right
frazzing.

                                                                  jms

      When characters die, they stay dead.  The one and only sorta
exception to this is Sheridan, and only for a) reasons that make sense,
b) reasons that are essential to a mythic structure, and c) really are
just a postponement; he's been reanimated and can last another 20
years, but that's the max.

{original post had no questions}

      Thanks.  One of the things about the way events come to a head
and finish in ITF is that it's very unnerving...okay, *now* what?  The
ongoing conflict has become something you could count on, you knew the
rough shape of what might be coming along.  Now all that's kicked over,
and you have to get on with the next aspect: making a new life.

      What interests me, what I wanted to do with making this show,
was in large measure to examine the issues and emotions and events that
precede a war, precipitate a war, the effects of the war itself, the
end of the war and the aftermath of the war.  The war is hardware; the
people are at the center of the story.

                                                                  jms

       No, Sheridan's view of the future, the moment he saw, is still
very valid, and will happen as written, once he took the step of taking
B4 into the past.  That future is now set.

       Certainly Londo would like to avoid his fate, and Lady Morella
prophesied certain ways of doing this...and he's had some chances, and
blown them.  As you say, he's creating the very future he'd hoped to
avoid.

       I think that, for me, what mitigates against that is that a) it
wasn't just Delenn and Sheridan, it was with virtually every other
major civilization around backing their play, and adding their support,
their voice, even being williing to die for the sake of this
confrontation.  If it were just the two of them...they'd be scragged. 
The two forces needed to be shown that the others had turned against
them, and that their true faces had been exposed.

       b) The other key for me is that neither the Vorlons nor the
Shadows saw themselves as conquerers or adversaries...both believed
they were doing what was right for us.  And like any possesive parent,
they'll keep on believing that until the kid is strong enough to stand
up and say, "No, this is what *I* want."

       Most wars tend to end with one singular even...sometimes it's a
big bomb, or a series of big bombs...and sometimes it comes with a
negotiation. The two sides meet in a room, sometimes with
representatives of other nations, and together they hammer out a truce,
or a peace.  There's the Nagasaki solution on the one hand, and the
"let's meet in a room and talk about this" of Jimmy Carter, Anwar Sadat
and Minister Begin.

       Both work.

      He asked if Ericsson was married because, if he was, that was a
call that Sheridan would have to make, over Stellarcom or in person, to
notify her that her husband was dead.  And, for Sheridan, I suppose
there was a tinge of relief, knowing that at least he wouldn't be
creating a widow as well as ordering Ericsson to do what was necessary.

      Because we'd still be rendering it.  There are 114 EFX shots in
that episode, and as it was we just barely made the satellite uplink. 
If it wasn't absolutely necessary, better to do it more simply.  As it
was, we were rendering the shadow form too.

      Someone once said that writing involves constantly proving you
have talent to those who have none.  But some suits don't want to admit
that, and figure, if they can hold a pencil, they can write.  Because
they have no respect for writers or the written word.  So they screw
with it. Constantly. Which is why I consider myself very lucky with B5,
in that they have left me alone and not interfered.

      I don't think the shadows speaking through Lyta referred to
Delenn by name; they said only, "And you they have left for us."

      The jostling from the asteroid was an accident, though the
others would've figured out what was going on soon enough.

      Thanks.  There is a definite parent/child/parent dynamic going

      There was never any alternate version of "War," only my notes.

      The songs will surface somewhere, eventually, I'm sure.

      Won't make any difference.  WB Video doesn't release *any* TV
series on tape or disk; that it would make money, it seems, doesn't
matter...they only want to be involved with the high-visiblity
big-budget sure-hit movies, not piddly TV shows.  So all the letters in
the world -- and they've received a lot of them -- apparently won't
make any difference to these people.

"BTW, it is VERY enheartening that you speak out for the actors--good
show!"

      I think you *have* to.  The reality is that these individuals
were the core of the ST phenomenon.  It wasn't the EFX, good as they
were...it was the characters, and the capacity of viewers to care about
those characters, as portrayed and given life by these actors.  They
deserve recognition for creating something that has endured for 25
years, and to be rudely treated by the studio seems to me vastly
inappropriate.  (Did you know that until just recently, when the bulk
of the original ST actors took action against the studio, they had
individually received as little as $16,000 total as their share of the
25 year multi-billion dollar ST franchise?)

very soon.

{original post had no questions}

      Thanks.  You pick up on a lot of good stuff.  I've suggested the
use of a minor chords version of the theme music to Chris on several
occasions, where it seemed right, here, Signs and Portents, and in
others.  The change from minor to major chords does signal an emotional
transition, and it works well.

      The director initially didn't want to do the Londo rage scene in
one take; it was something I felt very strongly about, and I think it
works well.

      BTW, there's another example of a long single take coming up
soon, on Epsilon 3, which is all I'll specify.  I kinda wanted the
scene to play itself out, without cutting, and to show just how
amazingly capable some of our actors can be.  We're talking here almost
4 minutes of footage, not one cut in the whole thing, very fast
dialogue, and not a single muffed line, with the performances working
wonderfully.  You'll know it when you see it.

                                                                  jms

      Thanks.  You definitely hit a lot of the symbolism right on the
head. One could almost argue for the whole scene as a classic
"intervention" out of psychotherapy or group counseling.

      Very early on, John Copeland asked me, "Okay, bottom line it for
me, what's the war about?"  I said, "It's about killing your parents." 
And his eyes went wide, and I explained, "No, not literally...but at
some point you have to step outside the control of your parents and
create your own life, your own destiny.  That process is
inevitable...and if there are indeed older races, and they're
interfering, that puts them smack in the middle of that same process."

      It's not about who has the biggest gun, because there's *always*
somebody else with a bigger gun...it's about *understanding* your way
out of a problem.

                                                                  jms

      RE: actors and producers...it's a mixed bag.  Some producers
prefer to have as little as possible to do with the cast.  And
relations can be *very* strained, which leads to a lack of appreciation
of the cast.  On B5, the cast and I hang out, we go to dinner, do
conventions together, and I learn more about what they can do.  It
creates an atmosphere where you want to reward them and show what they
can do.

      You got it right...there was more in that scene, but we were

       It's a combination of elements, Londo's fall, and yes, the
Vorlons had a very minimal affect on the Centauri, they never were able
to get a really strong foothold there.

       While she has written prose for Twilight Zone magazine, and
other national publications, and is a Clarion graduate, this will mark
her first novel.  It's quite good (having read most of it now),
tracking Sinclair's journey from B5 to Minbar, taking up the role of
Ambassador, then transitioning to head of the Rangers.

       This book stands to be the first one (closely followed by
Jeanne Cavelos' forthcoming B5 book) that's 100% canon...to be
considered a true chapter in the B5 storyline.

       What's fun about it is that it ties all the books and comics
together with the show, and puts it all in chronological order, and
weaves in and out of events in the second season.  I think this is
going to be a fan favorite. The Cavelos book follows Anna Sheridan as
she comes to join the crew of the Icarus, and the details of their fate
at Z'ha'dum.

                                                                  jms

       No, Valen was a done deal, as far as the Vorlons were
concerned; they knew that that happened/would happen.  It was Sheridan
and Delenn who had to go through this...and in Delenn's case, more for
her benefit, in some ways.

      The other books...in broad strokes, I accept they happened, but
in the details, and how they're treated, and some incidentals...they
haven't hit all the right cylinders.  This time, with this batch, I got
more directly involved and I think they're definitely improved...though
the Cavelos novel had the least need for input, since she *really* knew

       No, Lyta doesn't officially work for Sheridan, but she has
nowhere else to go, and is beholden to him just for everyday survival
and protection against the Corps.  That makes her answerable to him.

       Actually, though the tougher Delenn is in flashbacks in 2
weeks, the foreground/contemporary story has her very tough, and very
smart. Basically, the next mini-arc sequence focuses a LOT on
Delenn...she has many facets, and while part of that is the
relationship, there's steel there as well, and we're going to explore
that.  As she at one point comments to Sheridan, "I appreciate that you
have come to care for what I have become... but never forget who I am,
or what I can do."

       After this arc of hers, nobody's ever going to make that
mistake.

       Nope, the events of WWE *cemented* the events that are to come.
What we saw in that flash-forward will now happen precisely because of
what has been done.  That future will take place.

       As for the story being over...not by a long sight.  Frankly,
some of what's coming in the latter part of this season is more intense
than anything we've done previously.  We really focus in on the
characters and the after-shocks of the war, in ways usually ignored.

       After all, we all know how nice and calm and civilized Europe
was after the War To End All Wars came to an end...we hardly heard a
peep from that part of the world thereafter....

      Megacon in Florida would be the next biggie.  I'll be at that
one in Orlando March 15th and 16th.

      BTW, here's one of those little things that make you go
"hmmmmm...."

      That Starlog has an anti-B5 bias has always been evident, and
has covered us only reluctantly covered us.  There is a convention
listing page in the current issue.  It mentions the Gallifrey
Convention happening this weekend here in LA, lists the guests...but
omits my name.  So you figure, "Okay, it's an oversight."

      Then there's a listing for MegaCon in Orlando.  Now, understand
that MegaCon *advertises* in Starlog.  Three pages earlier, there's a
huge half page ad for MegaCon with my name in huge letters as the
primary guest.  But in the convention listing for MegaCon, all the
others are listed *except* me.

      One you figure could be an oversight...two, in the very same
magazine that has a huge ad for one of the conventions, starts to look
like a deliberate snub.

      Or, more succinctly, "Hmmmm....."

      I think a lot of SF writers stayed with it because of
familiarity.  SF writers, and folks like me (still not entirely sure if
I belong in that category), were invariably the first ones on our block
to have personal computers...back when that meant a Kaypro II with 64K
ram and 128K floppies and NO internal hard drive, and an 8" green
monitor.  (I still have mine, incidentally, I'm too sentimental to
throw it away.)

      Back then, Wordstar was pretty much the way to go.  That's what
I learned on, and that's why I use it.  I like the WYSIWYG approach,
and it does feel like a typewriter.

      The WS for Windows was a nightmare, and I deleted it instantly. 
Is there any indication that they're going to be trying again any time
soon? I'd like to use the capability that comes with windows, but I'm
too short on time to afford the learning curve for another software
system.

      There are always some time jumps in the show, since there's only
22 weeks worth of shows, and they cover 52 weeks of a year.

      Production's coming along spiffily.  We're currently working

      So by Hans logic, any series of novels, like the Dune books or
anything else, is "limited by the imagination" of the person
responsible, and thus flawed...or Herbert was just full of it...same
for Tolkein, Clarke, Asimov, Smith and others.

      I think this is what's called a classic case of projection.

      Stephen has directed before, yes, though he hasn't done that
much episodic TV work.

      The final shot was strictly described in the script; the monitor
POV, the relative positions of everyone, the slight fisheye look and
the absolute silence.

{original post unavailable}

"FWIW, that was your most courageous episode yet, IMHO."

      I appreciate the sentiment, so don't take this as lack of
gratitude on my part; I'm happy you perceive it that way.

      But courageous?  No.

      Courageous as an apellation belongs to the South American
writers who insist on telling the truth about their governments, who
risk death on a daily basis for doing so...and to other writers doing
similar work in other countries.

      Yeah, it was kind of a shot to the midsection for some groups,
with a certain element of biting the hand that feeds you, but the truth
is, ain't nobody gonna come to my door in the middle of the night with
death squads, take me away, and torture me.  If you want to hear about
real courage, join PEN International, or Amnesty International.  They
can always use the help.

      My feeling is, if I'd wanted to do 'em as books, I'd've done 'em
as books.  The story was designed for TV, and that's probably the best

      No, I don't make any blanket condemnations of journalists.  For
one thing, there's a difference between portraying journalism in a
relatively free society, and one that's operating under a dictatorship,
a la President Clark. It's the difference between journalism and
propaganda.

      In "Midnight on the Firing Line," we had a reporter there doing
a straight-ahead story; in "Point of No Return" we had the Good
Journalists fighting to reveal the truth even as Clark was shutting
them down.

      There have been favorable portrayals; it's just that under the
current regime, they don't have access to the media.

                                                                  jms

      The Hubble looks pretty new and gleaming, until you get right up

       My knowledge and association is at some distance.  I met with
some of the people putting this together while I was in Florida, and
they include a number of folks who have been long-time online
supporters of B5, who apparently have a good background running
conventions.  I know that they are making a honest effort of this, and
are doing all they can to make it a good convention.  Beyond that, I
can't say that we're actively involved in it. It has all the earmarks
of something that would work out, but I have no way of knowing that,
any more than any other first-time convention...except to know the
intentions of the people, which are good, and their experience, which 
seems to be solid.

                                                                  jms

       No, the Netter release DOES NOT specifically state that there
will not be a season 5.  It talks about the current 88 episodes in the
can, which TNT wants to go with asap, but we've been told by WB that a
concurrent airing of season 5 and the TNT reruns is a possibility, so
it's still in the discussion process.

       Re: "programming franchises"...I agree.  I went and yelled on
Doug today, because this came out of the offices of the financial guys
in his company, and their only goal is to make everything big and
productive sounding for their stockholders, and that's the kind of
language they love. I didn't even see the thing until I logged on
today...and created several new orifices for him in the area of "these
things never go out unless I see them first!" Financial people and
creative people have different concerns and different priorities. 
(Which is why there were no quotes from me in this, I didn't know it
was going out.)

       So people have been yelled at on this one.

       I think they had to tweak the color in the transfer to avoid

      They're all fine actors who've been vastly underappreciated,
under utilized, and typecast.  We don't cater to that.

Subject: To Sysops from jms

      Some recent rumors have come to my attention over the last few
days, which I hope, in this forum, to put to rest.

      The rumors concern messages, posted here, which may have used
the occasional reference -- largely allowed on television, in
magazines, on the radio and elsewhere -- words such as "pissed off" or
"ass," that have been deleted or moved out of public view.  That is to
say...censored.

      Understand that those words are good enough for the Bible, which
tells us that god will "cut off from His presence he who pisseth
against the wall," and refers to the "jawbone of an ass."  Now, if such
language is good enough for the Bible, then it seems to me that such
terms should be good enough for Compuserve.

      Now, I say "rumors" because I'm sure that the sysops will now
come forth and explain that this was a terrible misunderstanding, that
no such thing ever happened, and will not happen in future.

      Granted, obviously, there are certain words and phrases that
have no place in a forum such as this...the really Tough Words. 
"Pissed off" and "ass" are not tough words...they are not even
firecrackers in the world of harsh language, nowhere near the
occasional cannon or howitzer that is out there.

      Further, more disturbing, are the rumors that messages inquiring
about these censored messages, which do not in and of themselves
contain any such language, have THEMSELVES been deleted or moved out of
public view (essentially the same thing).  That it is now inappropriate
and unallowable to even ASK about such things, regardless of language
used.  And that such heavy handedness has caused the resignation of a
number of forum members here.

      I say rumors, and I say unfounded rumors, because surely even
Compuserve would not actually take such action, and I'm confident will
now step forward to say otherwise.  Why do I believe this?

      Because Compuserve has a public image to maintain, and the
information that it was driving off users and deleting messages for
asking questions about censored messages would cause a furor of
substantial proportions.

      Because I will be sure to post many colorful quotes from the
Bible in this space, and when they are removed, inform the National
Council of Churches that Compuserve is deleting material from the Bible
on the grounds that people should not see it.  In sum, censoring the
Bible.  This should go over extremely well in the press.

      Because Compuserve and the sysops must know that if such rumors
*were* true that I would be forced to resign from this area myself,
rather than tacitly endorse such heavy handedness.  I would publicly
announce that this area is not conducive to the open discussion of this
show, and that users should apply elsewhere.

      Because on a daily basis, I give interviews to major newspapers,
magazines, television shows, radio shows, internet publications and
other venues in which I am asked about the online discussions of
Babylon 5; I speak at conventions across the country where these
matters are also discussed. And if this really *were* the situation
here on CIS, then in all of these interviews I would have no other
choice than to talk about messages censored simply for asking about
policies on censorship and their rationalization, let alone for
essentially innocuous words.  I would talk about it *at length*, and 
ensure that every newspaper and magazine and TV show and radio show
and internet publication and convention I spoke to printed or discussed
this information at length.

      I would obtain the name of the CEO of Compuserve, and pass along
that information to journalists so that they could verify this for
themselves, since the idea is, as stated above, utterly
ludicrous...that any reasonably sane person could behave in such a
capricious and brutish manner.  If this policy were in fact being
enforced, then I should imagine that the CEO of Compuserve would only
be *thrilled* to defend its practice to journalists at all hours of the
day.

      Compuserve would surely know that such behavior can exist only
in the shadows, and that nothing so illuminates the corners of such a
discussion as a few well-aimed journalists...and where the average
person might not have a means of getting the word out...I do.  And I
have an obligation to the many B5 fans using this service to maintain
the *reasonable and justifiable* limits of language that have always
been used here in the past, and that a show which encourages the asking
of questions will support those of its fans who choose to ask questions
of others, including "Why was that deleted?" without having to fear
that inquiry being itself deleted or otherwise obscured.

      I expect now that the messages inquiring about deleted or
"disappeared" messages will be restored, and reasonable discussion be
permitted here, and this whole silly rumor discounted once and for all.

                                                                  jms

       It was most definitely difficult and painful for me to write. 
I am as much involved with these characters as anyone else, and doing

||Pictures or text exposing extreme cruelty, physical or emotional

sites).||

      Well, then you have an immediate probelm here, Wes.  The
deletion in question seemed to occur after only ONE appearance.  The
rule stipulates "more often than once every 50 messsages."  If you are
strictly adhering to this rule, then it stands to reason that you have
the statistics to back it up. Otherwise how can you enforce it?

      So it is incumbent upon you to demonstrate that the use of one
word occured more than once in every 50 messsages.  Please show me the
stats you used to verify this position.  Otherwise it is random,
capricious, and in direct violation of the rules you say you are
following.  Because by inference, removing messages that contain words
such as the one you note LESS than every 50 messages is a VIOLATION of
CIS rules...and since only you have the access to the full stats on
this system, it is now incumbent upon you to demonstrate whether or not
you are in adherence to, or violation of, CIS rules.

"As you can see, Joe, we really have NO CHOICE but to adhere to the
"Carlin's 7" list of forbidden words (and "but not limited to")."

      Except, of course, that Carlin's list of Words You Can't Say On
Television is no longer applicable, because many of the words he said
you couldn't say back in the 1960s and 70s *can* be said NOW on TV.  So
the rule itself is irrelevant.  Even Carlin himself has said so...I was
watching one of his HBO specials yesterday, and he his own self noted
that the list was no longer accurate, and he had to revise it upward to
include new and more interesting words (which he enumerated at great
length).

      Since CIS seems to be looking to a comedian to define its rules
on language -- odd since I can't ever remember a Supreme Court decision
favoring the Comedian Rule in examining issues of censorship -- then if
Carlin himself has stated that the rule no longer applies, then why
does CIS not recognize this?  If Carlin's word was good enough to make
the rule, why is it not good enough to UNmake the rule?

      Additionally, the argument falls apart on the basic principles
of language itself.  The word Carlin offered, another word for urine,
is not the same word as "pissed.  The latter refers to anger, and has
nothing whatsoever to do with bodily fluids of any form.  It's spelled
the same, but IT'S NOT THE SAME WORD, WES.  It's like *heat* and
*heat*.  They're both spelled the same, but one is a unit of
temperature, and the other is a term used in racing for a match between
several cars.  So you're in the unlikely position of deleting a message
for using a word that LOOKS like a word you supposedly can't say, but 
ISN'T the same word, wasn't intended as the same word, and doesn't
mean the same thing within context.

      From a simple, grammatical perspective, it isn't ON Carlin's
(now defunct) list because it isn't one of those words.

"You don't like it.  We don't like it. Perhaps it isn't an exact
parallel, but wouldn't you do something similar to avoid Babylon 5
becoming rated "R"?"

      I used language that I knew would get us a more restrictive TV
rating just two weeks ago.  Also, there is no R rating in TV.  The
highest you can go is TV-M.  Which was the category under which
Schindler's List was just broadcast...which received praise from
members of Congress (all but one), and was upheld by every conceivable
standard even though it featured full frontal nudity.  If I felt it had
sufficient merit, I'd be willing to go for a TV-M. If it's good enough
for Spielberg and Congress, sure, it's good enough for me.

"Members of these forums are welcome to ask about our policies and,
even, to question them.  However, such messages are considered to be
between the sender and the senior staff of this forum and are not
subject to open debate."

      So in other words, the discussions people would need to
determine what they should and should not say are closed off from the
people so that they cannot see those discussions and thus cannot know
when they offend, or why, or what recourse they may have.  "not subject
to open debate" is another way of saying "not subject to open
*dissemination*."  Sure, you can't do an offensive thing if everybody
knows about it...so you make sure the discussions of it all take place
in utter privacy.

      Every user here is DIRECTLY AND PERSONALLY affected by CIS's
policies on language and message content.  So how, then, can
discussions of these policies be excluded from the users?  Logically,
you *want* users here to know what the rules are, so that they
understand them, and thus you don't have to enforce policies that seem
arbitrary and blindside people.  Therefore the logic of "not subject to
open debate" falls apart on the face of it; the line stems from the
corporate arrogance that says, "We cannot be questioned, and we will 
not be held accountable.  Only YOU can be held accountable."

"As an example, in your role as sole producer/creator of Babylon 5,
would you tolerate the viewers of your program voicing their opinions
of its direction while you were producing it?  Such would be
distracting to the cast and crew and would be something best held in
privacy between those concerned and yourself."

      Well, in point of fact, every day I'm online, I hear from the
thousands of people online who express their opinions of the direction
of B5 while we're making it.  That's kinda why I'm HERE.

      Secondarily, the purpose of message boards is DISCUSSION.  The
purpose of a TV studio is to make a show.  Two different creatures. 
Which puts you in the position of, "The message boards are for the
purpose of users expressing their opinions EXCEPT when the messages are
ABOUT expressing their opinions, in which case they cannot express
their opinions."

      Every argument you have presented is either fallacious,
unprovable, involve mass exercises in paralogia, or come down to the
basic bottom line, "Because I *said* so, that's why!"

      It doesn't hold up, Wes.

                                                                  jms

      Oh, I forgot this one....

"But if it is our goal to stay off the Parental Control list and
therefore allow children to access discussions relating to topics in
this forum, then we must make every effort to adhere to its
restrictions."

      So to avoid restricting children, we will restrict the adults. 
In a forum where intelligent discourse is the goal, I'm not sure I
perceive the wisdom in this.

      And if the discussions are hobbled, what benefit is there in
guaranteeing access to conversations that are inhibited?

      How many children -- and define children here -- use this forum?
I very, very rarely see them here.  Are you restricting several
thousand adults for the benefit of 3 children?

      All of which is, of course, secondary to issue raised
before...are you actually keeping to the letter of the rules by
numerical content, or are you not?  If you are, then please show us
your math.

      Actually, the FCC does not define foul language in the fashion
you indicate, not in over 20 years.  And it does allow the broadcasting
of ALL the words on Carlin's "list" under certain circumstances.  (This
from my having worked for 5 years at a Pacificia radio station, which
kept us apprised of such rules.)  They don't tell you any longer what
words not to say...they just wait until an accumulation hits.  And
there is the 12:00 midnighr rule, which allows virtually everything and
anything to be said, as was the rule at many Pacifica stations.

      So, basically, it should be okay to read messages here with
language in them after midnight....

       Wes, you have still not replied to the main point of my
message.

       You say you are following the CIS rules, which will determine
whether or not sfmedone is placed on the Parental Control List.  But
the rules you quoted indicate that in fact this sort of language is
PERMITTED, provided that it does not happen more than once every 50
messages.

       You have still not shown to me that this was the case here.  On
what basis do you decide that it happened in 49 messages or 51
messages?  You have completely ignored my request for you to show me
the figures you used to make this determination...figures without which
you could not have made that determination...unless you just did it
arbitrarily.  Which is it?

       As for the quotes...every first year journalist understands
what Fair Use is, and what constitutes Fair Use.  Surely CIS can afford
one lawyer to consult for one hour to tell you what every journalist
knows...that to a large degree it's a matter of the extent of the
material quoted, its proportion to the original material, and whether
or not proper attribution is made.  If a book is at issue, quoting
several paragraphs certainly falls into fair use...while quoting
several paragraphs of a one-page poem would not, again due to the
proportions involved.

       I'm still waiting for you to show me the basis on which you
made your decision.  If you cannot provide it, you leave only the
impression that it was made arbitrarily, and that you *yourself* stand
in violation of CIS rules, and should be reported as such.

       However, that you are "rethinking" the policy is certainly a
good thing...in a way, it's not so much the policy as the *method of
implementing* that policy, and the extremes used, that may be most in
need of attention.

       BTW, I was interviewed just this afternoon by a reporter from
SciFi Entertainment on the online world, and went into this at some
length; it will likely show up in the next column there.  I'll be sure
to update her on further developments.

                                                                  jms
