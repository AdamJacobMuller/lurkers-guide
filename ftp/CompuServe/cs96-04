       Yes, it's easy to fire on the enemy when it's a faceless
entity; not as easy when it's someone you know.  Kinda brings it home,
makes it personal.

       We rode the audio on some sequences right to the legal limit;
don't know if we got clamped at any point along the way, to explain the
surround drop.  Will look into it.

       Nope.  B5 is not "a group effort of many worlds."  The Earth
Alliance funded the construction on all the Babylon stations, accepting
a little extra money from the Minbari and the Centauri toward the end
to help finish B5.  The currency is regulated in terms of Earth
credits, the laws in the Ombuds courtroom are Earth laws (except as
they encounter cultural laws between members of the same species), it's
Earth Alliance Station Babylon 5, and so on.  Is it fair?  Probably
not.  But that's how Earth wants it, and Earth runs, finances, oversees
and built B5.

"do you run your scrips by others?  IOW, do you make sure that it will
all make sense to others?"

      You must understand several things.  First, there's no one else
on a writing side to *run* things past here.  There's just me.  I *am*
the writing staff this season (which will probably not be quite the
same next season, if I can find the right people).

      The other thing is that writing is really a solitary business. 
There's the impression that in TV, stories get whomped around and
mushed up by some faceless committee.  While this is true in some
cases, it isn't true in all cases.  David Kelley's scripts are his
scripts.  Steve Bochco's scripts are his scripts.  My scripts are my
scripts.  If I don't know my craft well enough to know whether or not
it'll make sense to others, I should get out of the business
immediately.

      As soon as I finish writing the script, alone, it goes right
into production.

                                                                  jms

      Toni: thanks.  All of the characters shine in this one, Mira in
particular as Delenn.  It's a nice contrast; her speech to the Grey
Council is an intense piece of work that goes on for a while; her
declaration to the EA ships is short, to the point, and absolutely
deadly.  The right tool for the right job.

      I'm utterly pleased and proud of the job we did here.  Partly
because it's just so nifty on its own terms, and partly because it
gives us a new level to try and beat.  Up until now, I've been looking
to top "Coming of Shadows;" now the goal is to top this one...and I
think it's possible there may be one or two even this season that'll do
that, but tonally I think they're different enough that it might end up
as a tie.

      I definitely wanted the close-in, hand-to-hand fighting to
personalize what's going on.  It's also very logical strategically. 
You send in your forces to disable or overwhelm C&C, distract them,
slip in a cadre of troops to a station that (you hope) didn't know you
were coming...then they race to C&C and seize control from inside,
shooting anyone they have to en route.  If Sheridan et al hadn't known
the ships were coming in, this could've gone very differently.  But
once they were in, they were in close quarters, and you want to get in
closer if you're on the defensive side so that they can't use their 
weapons without cutting down their own people.  After that you have to
hope you can overwhelm the intruders with sheer force of numbers.  It's
an ugly, awful way to win a fight, because it *guarantees*
casualties...but what war doesn't?

      Something to bear in mind when rewatching, btw...it was during
this scene that Jerry fell and broke his right arm and right wrist. 
And they still had one last scene to film.  He stuck it out and they
rolled film, to get the shot of him and Zack at the end of the fight. 
Next time you watch it, keep an eye on the right arm as he releases the
helmet...it bends in directions never intended by evolution.

                                                                  jms

       We'd booked the actor long, long in advance.  At the last
minute, he bailed to do a DS9 episode playing, essentially, the same
character, despite our having first dibs.

       So I killed off the character.  Didn't change the story by the
smallest measure.  May actually have helped, since it raised the stakes

       Yes, the Thunderbolt furies were seen both on Mars and
attacking B5.

       A normal Starfury can't function in an atmosphere environment. 
The new Thunderbolt models have airfoils/wings that are folded back
over the body of the ship for non-atmospheric maneuvering, and then
extend out to full sized wings when entering an atmosphere.  (You'll
get to see in detail how this works back and forth in "Ship of Tears.")

       At this point, with the Council broken, Delenn isn't currently
running Minbar...there's a vacuum of power.  The system can carry on
for a while, the balance between the castes is pretty efficient, but
this is going to have to be resolved, and some in the warrior caste may
suspect Delenn of doing this so she *can* rise to power.

       As part of Valen's covenant, to prevent one caste from taking
over the other, each caste has access to its own warships.  This was
done to create trust a thousand years ago, and since then, since there
hasn't been any conflict between Minbari, the three castes own their
own warships still, but in general are assigned to Warrior caste as a
courtesy, which can be revoked. As Delenn noted, the worker and
religious castes control 2/3rds of their forces.

                                                                  jms

       No, 5 left the council with her.  And one can wonder, Did she
turn down the position of leader of the Grey Council, which would be a
balance for that role, in order to eliminate the council and become
primary ruler? (That is what some of the warrior caste are bound to
begin wondering after a while.)

       Each caste populates the ships in their jurisdiction with their
own people.  Which is why those on the Minbari warships that came in,
which we'll see shortly, are religious caste, no warriors among
them...but even the religious caste is well trained in combat, as part
of their education in temple.  We've seen some of this already in
Lennier's abilities in a fight.

      Both questions have the same answer: logically, G'Kar knows that
his father is dead.  He saw him die.  So whoever this was, wasn't his
father, even though he was appearing that way.  Or was a spirit, and
either way, he would've been sufficiently apprehensive about it not to

      What you also have to bear in mind sometimes is that *this* is
the only way to get things done.  When the Allies stormed Normandy
Beach, they knew that German bunkers and machine nests and fortified
positions were right there on the beach waiting for them.  But they
stormed out, onto the beach, and the first lines were cut down, one
after another after another, hundreds, literally thousands of soldiers.
But those behind were able to get through, take up position as best
they could.  Some of them clung to the edges of cliffs as Germans above
laughed and threw down grenades into their midst.

      Sometimes there's no other way.  But you do it because those who
command you have the moral authority to say "You probably will not come
back, but the cause is just, and fair, and necessary."

      Thus do we go off to die.

      Well, G'Kar doubtless *thinks* he saw a spirit, possibly the

G'Lan, of course, taking that image in order to give him a revelation.

      Real simple.  For starters, both Senators are on the Babylon 5
Oversight Committee, and the CO of B5 is answerable to that committee,
as those in the Pentagon are answerable to the senate for senate-funded
activities.  Also, the matters in question, such as the labor strike,
were not strictly military matters, but *civilian* situations.

      The comics may finally be getting back on line.  There will be a
meeting in May in NY to finalize stuff there.

      I will not, however, be writing directly for the comic anymore. 
DC has a policy that they will not allow writers final say on their
books.  Only the editors.  On all books written by other writers, as
per their contract with DC, I via WB, have final approval.  However, if
I function as a writer, then I must give up that right and allow myself
to be rewritten by the editor. It's a jurisdictional matter.  Suffice
to say I was appalled by some of the rewriting done on what I'd turned
in on the four issue arc.

      Consequently, I will not be writing that arc, or any other books
for the DC title.  I will be happy to provide information to keep the
story current with the series, farm out premises so it stays canon, and
work closely with the writers in my approval status.  That way I can
make sure the work is to our standards; if I write for the book, I
cannot do so, because the editor insists on rewriting me to maintain
DC's jurisdictional structure.

                                                                  jms

it seems louder and bigger.

      Thanks.  Yes, it's designed to get you revved up at the retreat,
it's our natural reaction.  The TV Logic thing to do would be to go to
black at that point, and the commercial.  But this show is about
consequences, choices and responsibility, and to *not* have that last

      All I'll say here is that there were *so* many EFX here that we
mixed the episode a few days before delivery, and got it down there 2
hours before the process for uplinking the episode to stations.  It was
the hardest thing we've ever done...but it was worth it.

                                                                  jms

      Exactly.  If you're going to do something as monumental as what
Sheridan does here re: B5's status and Earth, it can't be done lightly
or frivolously or without sufficient cause.  It has to be an absolutely
last resort.  If we'd done it any sooner, it would've been less
effective, and more of a cheat.

      And yes, after two breather stories, "Ship of Tears" starts the
arc moving again, and with very few exceptions doesn't let up for the
rest of the season.

      No, those aspects are kept absolutely separate and

tradition, some warrior caste have been involved with the others,
mainly as a courtesy.

      Except, of course, you now have an extraordinary situation in
which the Major, through the death of his CO, was now the commanding
officer of the Alexander.  In ordinary circumstances, this would mean
he'd be given a field promotion.

      Second, I don't recall any situation where the Major was "giving
orders to a commander."  The aide on the deck of the Alexander was a
Lieutenant, as I recall.  Also, if Hague indicated that he was to be
given command as he died, that would likely be honored.  Finally, yes,
the Major was involved in the discussions of strategy, but in *every
case* he presented Sheridan and Hiroshi with options, and because it
was Sheridan's neck of the woods, it was left to Sheridan to give
orders.  He coordinated the defense, and was the only one speaking
directly with the Agrippa.

      I think Sheridan was kinda up to his ears in matters graver than
the Major's field promotion, though you're right, he had one coming (as
I noted in an earlier message).  Given that they'd just broken away
from Earthforce, and walked away from the rank structure to some
extent, it would seem a rather indulgent exercise, since Earth
certainly wouldn't recognize the field promotion of a renegade officer.

      Yes and no.  They came through the "floor" which would be the
outer hull.  Like any good ship, the station has two hulls for
protection, an inner hull and an outer hull.  Once breaching the outer
hull, they moved into the inner hull, then angled up for a wall they
could blow out.

      I figured this would make more tactical sense because if they
just blew through the floor, they'd have to *crawl* out one or two at a
time, whereas if they angled in safely and then came in through a wall,
they could pour in more quickly, en masse, and be less vulnerable.

                                                                  jms

      Narns are strapped in because they don't have artificial
gravity, or rotating sections; if they weren't strapped in they'd be
floating about.

      C&C is a little over one-third of the way from the central hub. 
This gives you about 33-35% of normal gravity, so a person weighing 200
pounds would weigh about 66-70.  (Yes, we did the math on this.)  So
you're not going to see anybody bouncing around the walls.

       Clarifications: B1-B3 were never finished, but sabotaged very
early in construction, so the cost impact wasn't that high.  Only B4
was completed. When it vanished, the project was almost abandoned, but
then the Minbari and Centauri agreed to help finance the project, and
the EA went ahead with a scaled-down version, their last shot at it. 
Hence, B5.

      Thanks.  Any work of fiction must, on some level, make you
*feel* something for the characters, so it isn't just an intellectual
exercise, or the resolution of the plot.  If you can touch the
emotions, then you've got something very special.

      Several corrections to your note:

      1) That was not Ta'Lon in the episode.  He didn't appear
anywhere in this episode.

      2) Jerry didn't hide his broken arm in the pocket because it
wasn't broken at that time.  That scene was shot previous to the
earlier scene (we shoot out of sequence, like all shows).

      3) It's Sandra Hiroshi, not Hidoshi, so no relation to the
senator.

      Well I wouldn't consider the story with Mr. sebastian to be a
wedding like scene (unless you go to some different sorts of weddings
than I've ever been to), and the fruit scene (with Sinclair, not
Sheridan) was primarily a rebirth ceremony, so again, I think the
"pattern" is perceptual.

      "...can we settle on the fact that the shadows are "bad" or at
least completely and utterly selfish?"

      You're putting human motivations on an *extremely* alien
culture, which may have its own reasons for doing what it's doing. 
(Actually, *everyone* has their reasons for doing what they're doing,
even the Nazis used the argument of Lebensraum, living space, to
justify their actions.)  So I won't say we can settle on this, no.

       Thanks....

      Thanks.  Yeah, the older I get, the more I realize there are
things you can do with silence you can't do with words, though I still
love the form of the speech.  There was a lot of counterpoint in this
episode, a tool I'm still playing with as a writer; eventually I'll
figure out how to really use it properly.  (Though there's an
interesting scene up later this season using another kind of ironic
counterpoint which I think works pretty well.)

      Because he saw the actual co-running of security, and their

      "JMS is on an anti-typcasting crusade."

      That's actually true, in a lot of ways.  My sense is that here
we have many actors who created enduring works because they were good
at what they did; they're *good actors*.  But because they were so good
at it, they got typecast as only able to play that.  How many people
snickered, wrongly, when they heard Walter was going to be Bester? 
"Chekhov in the Psi Corps," was the usual lament.

      Until they *saw* him.  And saw what he could do.

      To work against the typecasting is simply payment on a debt to
those who created enduring characters.  And I'll continue to do it
wherever and whenever I can.  (Look for Robert England in an upcoming
episode playing a very different sort of character than he's played
elsewhere lately.)

                                                                  jms

      Real simple.  Lennier was still on-station.  All she had to do
was check in with him en route and find out.  Also, she went to the
council for the purpose of getting military support because she knew
heavy stuff was coming down, in one form or another.  Knowing that "the
humans are fighting one another" as she said to the council, it's
evident that if they didn't come to B5 that day, they'd come shortly
thereafter.

      So no, not a major error at all.

      Thanks.  The Grey Council could've taken a lot more action to be

with the rangers, giving aid to the non-aligned worlds...there was a

      In a sense, it's going from one emotion or thematic element to a
very different, but equally strong one, either as bookends or through
intercutting. Going from the high of the victory, to the sudden shot of
the dead troops, is thematic counterpoint.

      Here's another...in "Cabaret" you've got a scene where the
performers in the Cabaret are doing the sort of German dance where you
slap your knees and thighs and chest...and they take it a bit further,
slapping one another, it's all for comic effect...but during this,
you're intercutting the owner of the cabaret being beaten to within an
inch of his life by some Brownshirts outside.  You go from comic to
brutal and back, with the result that the happy little dance suddenly
takes on ugly characteristics, and the beating takes on the sense that
the participants are having a sick kind of fun, that it's all just
another kind of dance, a ritual.

      That's what you have to look at as a writer...how this scene
works, and how it interacts with the scenes in front, behind and
"beside" it (for things happening simultaneously).  Sometimes, with the
proper counterpoint, you can add whole new levels of meaning to a
scene, or make the scene much stronger than it would've been on its
own.

                                                                  jms

      We haven't seen those scenes because we don't know anyone there
really, and in an hour show you only have so much time, and within our
budget we only can do so much.  Every speaking role you add costs
thousands of dollars. Every set costs thousands of dollars.

      We're doing the absolute best we can with a budget roughly 1/2
of any of the ST episodes.

      If it isn't *absolutely necessary* to the scene, it isn't in. 
Yeah, seeing some folks in EA talking back and forth about well, maybe
this isn't a good idea, maybe it is, well, let's get back to
work...it'd be an interesting aside, but in addition to slowing down
the pace of the episode, and this one had to move like a house afire,
it's just not something I felt we could or should do.

      Harlan does pretty much whatever Harlan wants.

      As for the fight, ships on either side would have FOF (Friend Or

friendly fire.

      Thanks.  What you say about relationships is quite true.  The
slow process of getting to know somebody, the courtship, the parries
and feints and false starts are 85% of the fun.  It's the process of
getting into somebody's mind, discovering who they are.  And that's
what these two are doing.  It's an awful lot of fun.

       I hope nobody takes this the wrong way....but I think some of
the earlier slowness in the first season episodes has something to do
with being ST-programmed.  It's a pacing we've all kind of gotten used
to, lots of standing around and discussing stuff, and for everyone
concerned, particularly the freelancers, it's a *very* hard mindset to
break.  It took a while to work that out of everyone's system so we
could concentrate on telling a story the way only we can.

       Also, bear in mind that the first season or so we had to spend
a lot of time establishing our universe, the politics, history and so
on, so that the events we're seeing now would have some weight.  Now
that we've done all that, laid the foundation, we can just rip along at
top speed.

                                                                  jms

       We've shown clean-up crews before outside, including a hazmat
station that goes out to clear away fuel cores or other toxic material.
They would've been dispatched for this.

> Who is loyal and who is traitor?

       Actually, yes, I tend to ask for musical counterpoint in the
show from time to time.  For instance, when Sheridan et al were going
to the area where the crowd was waiting, I told Chris to fool us...give
us an ominous sounding sting going into what's going to be a very "up"
scene.  In the battle earlier on, when you'd normally do something fast
and exciting, I asked him to give me something more somber, to pull out
the Requiem theme in a few places. Sometimes, in other shows, I ask for
music that works against a scene to control the emotional core of it;
if it's a bit too silly, perhaps, then I go for a more serious musical
cue to balance it out.  Where a scene would seem to ask for major keys,
I go for minor chords.

       It's all just part of the tapestry.

       (BTW, a little secret...just for fun, I wrote a couple of songs
that you'll be hearing in an upcoming episode.  I used to write songs
here and there, even did a couple for an ABC prime-time special, and
figured I'd try it again.  I wrote the lyrics, discussed the music with
Chris, and he took care of the score, and it's about what I first
conceived.  Came out pretty well, actually.)

       Bear in mind that if we had gone over to the other captains and
what was going on in the other ships, to make room for those scenes we
would've had to cut anywhere from 3-5 minutes of the other stuff.  You
can't just add to the show's time; if that goes in, something else has
to come out.  So you'd probably have to cut the scene between Sheridan
and his father since that was the only stand-alone set piece.

       Any time you write something, you must decide "who is it
about?" This episode was about *our characters*, the ones we've come to
care about, and how they deal with this.  To take away from that and
spend time with people we've never seen before, and won't see again,
would be to cheat our characters of the time on screen needed to pay
off all the things we've set up over the years.

       Would it have been an interesting aside to show the other
captains? Sure.  In a movie, with an open-ended running time, I
probably would have. But there's nothing I would want to cut out of the
episode as it now stands to make room for it.

       An act is a discrete dramatic unit separated by commercials

       Fighters re-enter via the main docking bay and are recharged
and lowered into the fighter bays.

       No question, spare parts would be a problem, and they'll have
to cannibalize a lot (plus whatever they scrounged up from the fighters
blown apart outside).

       Starfuries serve a *lot* of functions which we've shown before
on the series.

       They can take out a ship's defensive screens and
countermeasures, allowing access by the big ships' armaments.  In a
group, they can take out a good sized ship on their own (a la the
Centauri cruiser in "Fall of Night"). They also serve to protect the
station's defense grid from aggressor starfuries.

       Also, a number of small support ships, including a Hyperion
class ship came through as part of the "carrier group" that went after
the station.  It was up to the starfuries to take care of those ships
while B5 and the other destroyers took out the biggest threats.

      Well, Roanoke is a place rich with history.  Some of it a little
odd, given the colony's disappearance, but rich nonetheless.  (Clark
has edged away from giving Omega class destroyers and others names from
Greek mythology and history, toward more conventional names like the
Clarkstown and the Roanoke.)

      Thanks.

      Re: Foxworth...it was really the only thing to do.  I'd created
the character *specifically* to have him available for this episode,
after which he'd basically fade away while others took up his standard.
It was all leading up to this.  Without being in this episode, there
was nothing more to do with Hague, hence I felt quite comfortable with
his fate, it changed nothing.

      Certainly as they get more sophisticated, when just *doing it*
isn't the main goal, a certain level of aesthetics comes into play. 
Compare an early Model T to a modern Corvette, for instance.

         Basically, the warrior caste doesn't think it's their war;
there's also a certain amount of resentment in it, I think...they *led*
the last war, they *did* their job, and got yanked back and forced to
surrender.  That was a terrible blow to their pride, caused in part by
an alien race, so their attitude now tends to be more or less, "Screw
'em."

      The article portrayed, and somewhat overstated, the events of
last year. (I take some of the blame for this; I may have spoken
unwisely in a few places.)

      The main problem overall right now, for *every* syndicated show,
is that the available time slots are just totally disappearing, thanks
to committments to WBN, UPN and Fox.  They just yanked Lonsesome Dove
even though the ratings were good, and the show was a good show, simply
because they couldn't find enough berths on independent stations to
make it worth it for the national advertisers.

      It's certainly a dark cloud on the horizon; we'll just have to
see whether it blows past harmlessly or not.

                                                                  jms

Subject: B5 Cancellation RUMOR

{original post had no questions}

      Okay, Horse's Mouth time.

      We have not, repeat, not been canceled.  Right now, WB has
bought covers of newspaper TV magazines in over 80 cities that'll debut
over the next couple of weeks; they've also invested a huge amount of
money in a series of radio and TV spots that'll be airing on cable and
indie stations over the next 6 weeks.  They're currently running the B5
contest.  Several stations have announced that they're going to go back
to double-running B5 twice a week.

      Do you think they would do this for a show that's been canceled?

      They don't.  They cut their losses and run like hell.

      This is a jumble of information.  Yes, PTEN seems to be going
away; I've been saying this on the nets for the last several months,
and that we're going to move into straight syndication.  Someone has
apparently taken this and blown it all out of proportion.

      Every season, somebody announces that they've heard it on
absolutely firm grounds that we've been canceled.  Hasn't happened yet.
We've had our ups and downs, like any other show, but we're still here.

                                                                  jms

       Why?  Why not?

       I was on CIS and GEnie long before B5 got going.  I figured,
why change my habits just because now I was supposedly a vip?  (And I'm
not always comfortable with that designation.)

       Beyond that, my job as a writer is to know as much as I can
about my characters and universe.  In answering all these questions, I
learn more about those areas, which helps me.

       Finally, it's a matter of being accessible and *accountable* to
fans, as I'd wished producers had been when I was primarily a viewer. 
SF fans are generally the most exploited sorts of fans...you're told to
line up, watch the show, buy the merchandise, and shut up.  I didn't
like it then, and I don't like it any better now that I'm on the other
side of the lens.

                                                                  jms

       Exactly.  These aren't perfect or superior people...they're
just like us, faced with the same problems we're faced with.  What's
inspiring is seeing that people just like us *can* overcome these
things...at great price, yes, with great difficulty, yes, but if we
decide to act, we can succeed.

       And yes, instead of going for a sinister EA look, I wanted the
uniforms to be something we're used to, "our side," as you say.  There
aren't many blacks-and-whites on this show.  It's all greys...and
sometimes olive drab.

Subject: B5 v Star Trek

{original post unavailable}

       Let me tell you about a certain kind of sickness.

       The sickness manifests itself in pathetic individuals who, in a
non-electronic forum, would be lighting cats on fire to watch them
howl, or throwing rocks through somebody's window to see them all run
out.

       A few very sad, very pathetic individuals who want to feel
alive come into a forum and leave a message written in insulting terms
because they like to watch everybody get all wired up.  They sit back
and giggle and laugh and wonder gee, whatever was it I said? when they
know exactly what they said.  It was done deliberately, to manipulate
people and get them upset.

       You have no interest in a "survey."  You're a sick, sad and
pathetic individual with nothing more in his life than the need to
tweak people who follow a show that for whatever disturbed reason you
feel should be attacked in the name of Star Trek, even though that
means violating every principle of tolerance ever advanced in ST.

       Some here will probably tell you to get a life.  I would
suggest that you have a life...unfortunately, it consists of the kind
of life where one spends one's time pulling the wings off flies because
you like to see them squirm around on the table.

       And most pathetically, you've probably never even watched the
show, to bolster your opinion.  Maybe a minute or two here and there. 
But getting the facts doesn't matter.  Getting people's opinions
doesn't matter to you, really.  Just causing a flurry of angry messages
and upsetting people is all that really matters to you.

                                                                  jms

       Yeah, I'll probably try to get to it, but the basic reality is

       You could have accomplished exactly the same thing by just

and derides those who might actually watch it, it makes your statement
that you "did not intend to offend" rather...unbelievable, at best.

      I declined to answer this privately because I'm really and
honestly leery of spreading, or trying to spread, or being perceived as
trying to spread my own notions about.  What works for me, works for
me; your mileage may (and obviously does) vary.  What I do or don't
believe shouldn't enter into it.  That's why I've deliberately left it
*out* of the show. Otherwise you're not telling a story anymore, you're
engaging in propagandxa.  But if you're going to press the issue....

      As a writer, I don't feel it's my obligation to be fair to every
group on the planet.  That way madness lies.  But I do feel that it is
my absolute obligation to be *honest* in my portrayal of any group, as
well as I am able to perceive it.  If I write about a Minbari, then I
must be as honest I can in addressing who that character is, what he
feels, what he believes, and so on.

      So why should it seem such a leap that, as an atheist, I do the
same when it comes to religion?  I suppose the question itself is the
truly astonishing thing...that it should seem strange or unusual to be
even handed and at least *try* to be honest.  Have we dropped so much
as a culture that the absence of pushing one's own agenda, and giving
an honest hearing of someone else's viewpoint, is considered
extraordinary?

      "The weaving of religion and scifi in your show is so well done.
Where does it come from then?"  It comes from the characters who
believe in whichever religion is under consideration.  If I am fairly
rigorous in presenting the scientific or extrapolative aspects of the
show, what then is odd about this other part?

      As a writer, it's my obligation to put myself in the mind of my
characters, and feel what they feel, and while I'm in their head,
believe what they believe.  If I do my job right, I offer those
opinions and thoughts and feelings with conviction, sincerity and
strength.

      Also, bear in mind that the religious impulse is not that far
removed from the sense of wonder of a scientist on unlocking a
particularly thorny DNA code.  (Note: science and religion are NOT the
same thing, their methodologies are diametrically opposed, and
creationism is NOT science, and evolution is NOT religion, however much
some might wish to make it so by saying it is.) The emotion is the core
truth of it all, what it *feels* like.  We've all experienced the sense
of wonder in one form or another; it's no major task to translate it to
another venue.

      The religious impulse, and the scientific impulse, both spring
from the same source...the desire to answer the questions, Who am I? 
What am I doing here? and Where am I going?  Those had to be the very
first questions we began asking when we became sentient, and we're
still asking them.  The supernatural or religious approach to that
question came first; the scientific approach much later.  The
scientific approach is, "How can I figure out the answer to the
question?"  The religious impulse leads you to, "Who can tell me the 
answer to the question?"

      The one approach is not intrinsically better than the other;
they feed very different needs.  And the whole point of *asking* the
question is to feed that particular emotional need for an answer.  You
find the venue that most matches the wellspring of your desire.  They
serve vastly different functions, are not comparable, but are no less
valid experiences for those involved.  The core feeling of a scientist
on receiving the first images from the surface of Mars are not far
removed from the feelings of the newly converted upon stepping forth at
a revival meeting.  Each gets what he *needs*.  And each is an
honorable pursuit within its own framework.

      "What brought you to the conclusion that there is no god?"  That
I haven't yet seen one in any of our "holy books" that deserved the
name; not one that wasn't afflicted by the same jealousies,
pettinesses, irrationalities and meannesses of the average human.  I've
met many humans who were better and nobler than some so-called deities,
who sacrified their limbs, their fortunes or their lives without the
sure knowledge that they would end up on the great white throne of
heaven for doing so.

      "Do you believe that we are all here due to one happy (or
unhappy) accident?"  My belief doesn't enter into it.  The best
physical evidence indicates that we evolved ourselves up from the
ground, pulling ourselves up by our genetic bootstraps across a million
years of struggle, evolution and blood, surviving because we were
smarter than anything that was stronger than us.  This, to me, is
something to be proud of; we did it ourselves, we weren't just created
whole and complete, all the work pre-assembled at the factory. We
walked on the moon because we *earned* it by growing smart, and
learning -- in however inconsistent and fractured a way -- to live and
work together more often than we fought with each other.

      "From your perspective -- what is the meaning of life?"  As an
atheist, I believe that we get just one ride on the merry-go-round, one
shot at the brass ring before they close the park.  That's it.  As a
result, I view life as being *incredibly* precious, a resource rarer
than any jewel.  A resource that must be protected, nourished, put one
step further along the road to a better road.  What we leave behind,
our only shot at immortality, is the work we leave, the accomplishments
that hold their place in the record books long after we've turned to
dust, so that our names have meaning.  In 50 years, nobody will care
much what religion Jonas Salk subscribed to; they will care only that
he cured a terrible disease, and made the world a better place.

      If we believe we are immortal, then we have wiggle-room to screw
up, because we'll get another chance; to waste our lives on the theory
that as long as we believe a certain way, it doesn't matter if we do
anything of consequence, we're guaranteed an eternity of harp music. 
If we believe the world will be swallowed by armageddon in a few years,
then there's no reason to protect the planet, plan for the future, find
a comfortable balance between nature and industry, so that we can
achieve the stars without destroying the planet.

      I don't have that luxury, and a luxury it is.  So I find my
version of immortality in the words, and in the work, and in the memory
of those I may touch, or help, or instruct, or entertain.

      You may not operate that way.  And that's fine.  It's our
differences that make us human, and our humanity that makes us
endlessly interesting.

      No, the PTEN change wouldn't really take effect until after year
three, assuming that goes on as it seems to be.  This year is still
under the PTEN aegis, and thus the cross promotion is necessary.

      Thanks.  I'm doing a lot to deepen up Marcus and Lennier, to let

on the show; even at this point, compare Lennier to the wide-eyed
innocent who first arrived at the station and couldn't even bring
himself to look Delenn in the eyes.

      Actually, no, the computer voice, Sparky, wasn't really a nod of
any kind to Hitchhiker's.  (And 2001's HAL beat them to the punch a
long time before that in any event.)  No, I just figured, if the

      Actually, it was no problem at all.  The similarity is only if
you choose to define them by their narrow roles.  Their personalities
are vastly different.  Also, Sinclair's been through a lot in the
intervening couple of years, he's grown, he and Marcus would definitely
have something of a relationship since he would've been there while
Marcus was being trained, and so on.  And their roles in the story are
very different.

      It actually came out pretty well.  I'm very happy with it.

      No, I didn't see or intend any element of Lennier being racist;
but there are definitely differences in culture and physiology between
Minbari and humans.  Minbari are very careful about personal space, and
they don't like to be talked to a certain way.  Marcus momentarily
forgot himself, and acted inappropriately.  Lennier corrected him.

      Unfortunately, we're not set up at the time to take credit

      Actually, we did it once, in "Messages," but not much therafter.
The main reason is the cost of renting varilights, and the height of
our ceiling, which is somewhat lower than where we shot the pilot.

      No, the "romance angles" aren't "late additions," but you don't
just leap into a romance right off.  You couldn't have had the
Delenn/Sheridan thing right in the beginning of year two, it had to be
built, and grow gradually.  Things are introduced as it is time for
them to be introduced. The shadows weren't even named until season two,
and didn't make their first appearance until late in season one.  Is
that a late addition?

      To your other points...a commanding officer needs a second, it's
that simple.  So it's not so much recasting the same part as filling
what's required in a military role.  Draal--Drall2 isn't a different
character, it's the same character.  Also, Lou Welch wasn't Garibaldi's
second in command, that was the guy who shot him.  He goes away, now
you need a new second who is a very different character.

      In real life, things change.  What I *like* about B5 is that
people come and go, the credits aren't the same from year to year. 
Otherwise you end up in a situation like folks complained about on TNG
where Riker didn't get a decent promotion in 7 years.

Subject: UK and budgets

{original post unavailable}

      No TV shows are sent around on film anymore these days; it's all
sent on digital tape.

      The exact budget isn't something we give out; suffice to say
it's under a million per episode, or about half the budget of an
average ST episode.

      We've come in a little bit under budget each year; not a lot,
but some. A small portion of whatever money isn't spent goes into
interim next season stuff (studio maintenance and improvements, set
storage and repair, that sort of thing).  The rest goes back to WB as
per our contract.

      In the syndicated ratings, B5 generally falls anywhere from the
low 30s to 40s during first run, a bit lower on long reruns.  But this
is out of about 250 or more syndicated shows per week.  So we're in
about the top 20% of all syndicated shows, and always in the top 10 of
dramatic series.

      I haven't actually seen any viewer numbers; I know the UK tends
to give them, but I've never seen the figure given for X-million US B5
viewers.

                                                                  jms

      The opening shot was made specifically for the title sequence,
as (for lack of a better term) a bit of foreshadowing.  We generally

      No, the b-story about Sinclair's brother was never intended to
be the Anna Sheridan thing, since obviously the reference was to his
brother still being alive.

      I never just transfer stories from A to B; each character has to
have his or her own individual arc, specific to who that person is. 
Bits and pieces get moved around, or reassigned, but not generally that
blatantly.

      No, the .avi files work in tandem with another file, to make it
work. You'll note that shpdta08.avi comes alongside shpdta09.dat (or
some other extension), which contains the info.  If you install it from
the disk, it usually works fine.  The scrittching sound on the
personnel data is the identicard scanner sound, which goes with the
identicard readout.

      I'm still not sure I understand the question.  The B5 videotapes
for sale in the UK are definitely licensed.  We never sell any episode
on film to anyone for any reason, here or otherwise.  Nothing's been
out on disk yet.

      Exactly, the older shows take on more substance, weight and
interest the more you've seen after them.  All kinds of stuff jumps out
at you after a while.  As for Bester...no matter what, it's fair to say
he's on nobody's side but his own.

      No, no direct involvement with Hypernauts, though they're one of

Babylon 5 model for producing TV shows.

      We'll be mentioning Na'Toth later this season.

      Actually, the relationship with Sinclair and Delenn wasn't
designed to be romantic; he was involved with Sakai, and would've
stayed that way for the most part.  The relationship you saw is not
quite what you're thinking; there is a closeness, but not based on
romantic feelings.  You'll catch a sense of what's behind this more
later this season.

      Aha!  Okay...the reason that the tapes haven't been released by
WB Video here in the US...is that they don't think anybody's interested
in buying them.

      Now, in the UK, the videos are usually in the top ten or so on
the sell-through charts.

      Somehow, the video folks seem capable of looking at those two
items and fail to see a contradiction.

      Space Cases uses a variation on the 5-year arc, a lot of what
they're doing with their sets and CGI and other areas nods to B5...and
there are two new shows in the works that very definitely rely on the
B5 model, though I'm not at liberty (as a courtesy to them) to discuss
them at this time.

      And yes, because anything can happen to anyone around here, it
makes this kind of thing more interesting.

      I was thinking about this the other day, and realized just how
much some aspects of the show remind me of a role playing game; you set
up the parameters, you know where the story has to go, and you bring in
some characters.  Some will live, die, be hindered, succeed, fail, or
go mad, depending on how the players react to the situation.

      We'll establish in coming episodes that they have to become more

the services it provides, and eventually docking fees will have to rise
if they can make a go of it.

starched, scrubbed, visually appealing...the face they wanted others to
see.  Now we see their true face, the scarred, dark, empty eyes, no
longer pretending to hide. So we kinda cast in that direction.

and what we do for one another.

      But no, not all relationships have to end badly (despite my own
general history in that regard).

      And agree re: Vir.  He's a much stronger character than anyone
might think.  He's sort of the "God's Fool" character, to get literary
for a second, who somehow manages to make it through it all.

      Yes, I think Mira was able to draw upon her background a lot in
this one.

      I also like the look between Marcus and Delenn as they stand in
the customs area...he looks like he desperately wants to say more, and
she like she desperately wants to hear it...but he turns and walks
away, the moment lost.

      I love writing for Marcus.  I can just come at the dialoge from
a completely different angle.  There's a certain edge, a dark kind of
irony that comes through his character that lets me do lines I can't do
for anyone else except sometimes Ivanova.  He's a hoot....

      Actually, no, the song in "Ceremonies" was not intended as a
Prisoner riff or homage of any kind.  If the song originated with The
Prisoner, that'd be one thing, but the song goes back a long, LONG ways
before The Prisoner was even thought of.

      What happened, actually, was this...I'm a big fan of the Red
Clay Ramblers, a terrific group that does sort of bluegrass but very
offbeat.  I was writing that episode, and I was playing with the
torture aspect, and had one of their albums on.  At just the moment I
got to that scene, up came their rendition of "Ezekiel in the Valley of
the Dry Bones."  The notion was perfect, so I went back to the original
version of the song, which is public domain (rather than their
variation on it), and used it.  Synchronicity.

                                                                  jms

      Your memory is correct.  Just before he did the first episode,
he had to shave his full beard for some commercial audition.  It hadn't
grown all the way back, and we had to darken it down a bit to make it

"TKO," as Garibaldi's corner man, though there it was hidden a bit.) 
He's still doing a lot of work though.

      Easy.  Takashima would have been the one to be Control.  A Psi
Corps plant.  (Her background on Mars would've been the perfect time
for it to have happened.)  When Laurel went away, I took that one
thread and passed it along to Talia, setting it up as early as the very
first episode, when Talia and Ivanova first meet, and later reluctantly
have a drink.

      At one point, Ivanova says to Talia, referencing Ivanova's
mother, "You're as much of a victim as she was."  To which Talia
replies, "I don't feel like a victim."  And, of course, that's exactly
what she was, though she didn't know it yet.  Ivanova's analysis was
100% correct.

      Yes, the way you describe the shot (zoom/move) was correct. 
It's what was indicated in the script, and well executed.

      That information was bound to get out sooner or later.  It's
okay.  We have Narns working security.

      Yeah, Meatloaf definitely "listens better than he watches,"
though in truth he's lost a LOT of weight lately, and looks 100% better
than in past years.  Most of his songs (even though written often with
or by others) tell stories, they have a lot of heart to them, they're
sometimes very funny, and there's a tremendous, enviable energy in
them.  You get the sense that he undrstands the only way to tell a
story sometimes is to put the pedal to the floor and go flat out for
the abyss, hoping to come out alive on the other side.  I commend to
you his two latest albums, Bat Out of Hell II and Welcome to the
Neighborhood.  There's some really nifty stuff there.

      I could've *sworn* there was a line there about the Narn
recovering; I'm going to have to check this.  I hope I didn't
accidentally cut it for time while doing something else.  (It was a
LONG editing session.)

      I figured the Narns were there to discuss the fates of their
families back home, but yeah, to a certain degree it was there as a
great end for the teaser.

       The answer to both your questions is about the same.  It takes
about a day to power down, or power up a jump gate.  It operates more
like a fusion reactor than a light bulb.  So not only wasn't there
enough time, even if they *had* had enough time, you'd want to leave
the gate up and running in case you needed to evacuate for any reason;
otherwise you'd cut off your main escape route.

       For the incoming fleet, knowing the gate was active was the way
to go, since it would let them launch their fighters prior to coming
in; if you use a jump point, you kinda have to launch while you're
coming out to avoid anyone being stuck behind.

                                                                  jms

      If I'd wanted Big Money, I'd've stayed on MURDER, SHE WROTE,
where I was paid *twice* what I get on B5, given that it's a top-ten
rated network show. But I left that to do this.

      This isn't a random casting about for an idea that makes money. 
For one thing, "ideas" don't make shows, characters do.  Second, if
what you posit were true, I wouldn't have built the show so that it
self-destructs after 5 years.  Finally, every season of this show for
three years plus the pilot for four has pushed the envelope completely;
we only have two years left.  Not much time to settle into complacency,
wouldn't you say?

      Maybe you should bea little less cynical and insulting about a
field about which you do not seem terribly well informed.

      No, we're still waiting on renewal, same as every show.

      To take off my producer cap for a moment and put on my fan
cap...yes, I understand your position.  Lots of people in this town
obsess about money, and everybody wants to tell you what to do.  I know
the problems Bellisario had with "Leap," and some of them were of his
own making, but the majority were from the Suits at Universal.  A large
measure of what eventually comes out of your show depends on who you
luck into as far as a studio liaison is concerned.  We got very lucky
in having someone who understands what we're trying to do, and hasn't
given a single script note since episode 2 of year 2. DB didn't have
that luxury; I don't think anyone at Universal really understood what
he was trying to do, which was unfortunate.

      My response was mainly from the other side of the statement,
implicit or stated outright, that implies everyone working in TeeVee
does so only for the bucks, that money talks and nothing else matters. 
There are some of us who are dedicated storytellers, first, foremost
and forever.  Tarring everyone with the same brush is just another form
of prejudice, and when it appears, it needs to be corrected.

      A lot of what happens out here in *The Industry* horrifies me. 
The quest for more, bigger, money-money-money.  Yes, on one level,
writers are vastly underpaid for what we do *in terms of* the amount of
money that the final product actually makes.

      But we are also vastly OVERPAID in terms of what people doing
the really important jobs are being paid: teachers, nursing staff, the
many layers of people who keep the nation going and prepare it for the
future.  So from where I sit, NOBODY out here has ANY reason to beef
about their money. We're hideously lucky to be working in a field where
we can entertain, and tell stories, and be well compensated for it. 
And I think too many people out here forget that.  Having grown up
fairly poor for most of my life, I *can't* forget it.

                                                                  jms

the splitting of votes cost us the award (combined votes would've been
enough going in to win), the folks gave us the option of withdrawing
one of the two, and since "The Coming of Shadows" seems the overall
favorite, that one was the one kept.

      One other good thing about the withdrawl of one episode was that
it allowed Terry Gilliam's "12 Monkeys" onto the ballot, which
otherwise would've been frozen out, and it deserves the recognition of
the nomination.

      We're all *very* pleased and excited by the nomination.

                                                                  jms

      At this point, with the rethinking going on back home, he's
bethrothed and promised, the marriage arranged, but not yet fully,
*formally* married. There's still ritual to go through.  The other
family could still choose to withdraw the arrangement.

      One of the patches is a Ranger patch; the other is the new B5
sword and shield logo.

      (BTW, on your web site, could you possibly withhold the synopses
 -- which are provided to the stations, and not intended for general
release -- until a little closer to the episode's airdate?  A couple of
those you've released have caused a fair amount of consternation, and
destroyed some of the impact I'd wanted with those episodes.  There's
nothing I can do to stop you from posting the information -- though
starting with "War" 2 I'm now personally editing the synopses to delete
some stuff -- but if you could just hold back even a little, it would
help me a lot.)

{original post unavailable}

      Just a quick public statement of support for the cards.  The
last batch were very good -- even ending up on some magazines' lists of
Top Ten Cards for the year -- and all indications are that this one
will be even better. Of all the things I'm asked to sign at
conventions, probably the #1 items are cards from the Fleer set (ditto
for many of the cast).  I'm definitely looking forward to seeing them.

      I dunno...it's hard to say.  After the first ST series, the ball
was dropped and *nobody* picked it up again really for almost 25 years.
After we're gone, it's hard to say if anybody'll do so.  We've gone out
of our way to bring in other producers and folks, show them how we do
the show, in the hope that they'll then be able to do the same and
create more in the future. Whether or not that happens is hard to say.

      Because it's not just the techniques involved.  B5 is only on
the air because I and a couple of others stood there and fought tooth
and nail for five years to get it on the air.  There has to be a
certain tenacity involved.

      On the other hand, Hypernauts is already using the B5 production
model for their show, and Space Cases has adopted the five-year arc
notion, so maybe the future is already here.

                                                                  jms

      Yes, I think it's very likely that's one reason we're more or

a reviewer (not a critic, I'm not that smart), and hung out with
others; the theaters or producers with whom they had a relationship,
they covered; those with whom they didn't, didn't get covered.

      But then, as was pointed out to me a while back, critics are
paid to be unfair, so you can't let it bother you.

      Yeah, there's a smidge of Alizon in Lyndisty, mainly in grammar

they're synopses sent to the stations for only their use.  They were

      Thanks (and thanks for the vote).  They gave me the option of

      No, we've just always assumed that not everyone on any given
planet is going to speak with the same accent as everybody else from
that planet. Seems more realistic.

      Certainly, among Centauri, a certain accent is more associated
with the "old school" of court nobility and the like.

      It was never, NEVER my intention, and I never stated, that the
Minbari were hermaphroditic, or that Delenn was then hermaphroditic. 
It was NEVER stated that they all went through a male-female change, so
it had NOTHING to do with the Left Hand of Darkness.

      The idea initially was to use a female playing a male character
because it added an offbeat, somewhat androgynous look to the
character, which I thought might be good for the character.  It was
only upon entering the chrysalis, and emerging, that Delenn would a) be
more human, and b) be female. When I discovered that the voice change
wasn't working as well as I'd hoped it would, electronically altering
it, I finally scrapped that aspect of it, but kept the human/minbari
change aspect.

                                                                  jms

Subject: Ejecting from a Fury

{original post unavailable}

      You can see explosive bolts going off, and a series of small
thrusters behind the cockpit area which allow for navigation.  This
gets the pilot away from the main body which has either been crippled,
or is about to explode, the same way a modern fighter has an ejection
system.  (Check the main credit sequence for a better shot of an
ejection.)

                                                                  jms

       So ANYthing you hear, either way, on this from anyone prior to

Braveheart seems to have brought him out of retirement.  He's simply
one of the best actors I've ever seen.

      We'd approached him in year one with a part, and things seemed
to be going well, until we were told he would be out of the country,
which nixed it. We'll get him yet.

Subject: Babylon 5 copied ST

{original post unavailable}

      The only problem with your theory is that there was never, ever,
at any time, any notion of copying Star Trek, and that perception tends
to exist only in those who don't generally know the full, rich
background of SF.  This show owes more conceptually to historical
themes, and the kinds of sagas that come down to us in the Lensman
books, Childhood's End, the Foundation books, Dune and others than any
TV show, including and especially Star Trek.

      The only similarity between ST and B5 is that they are both in
the future, and both set in space.  That's it.  Are you also willing to
state that every SF novel set in the future, in space, is *also*
copying Star Trek? Including those published before there ever WAS a
Star Trek?  And of course let's not even get INTO the Forbidden Planet
question.

      While I appreciate the *sentiment* of your note, I would commend
to you your local library, and the works of Heinlein, Clark, Asimov,
Sturgeon, Bradbury, Lovecraft, Dunsany, Russell, Smith and others. 
Your points of reference may need some measure of enlargement.

                                                                  jms

      The contact was made late in the year, and while that was the
first blow, it takes a while for any war to really get going; you
aren't at war instantly.  The Minbari had to pull their forces
together, make the open declaration of war, establish supply lines and
all the other elements needed for warfare.

      It's very difficult now; you have to go through secondary
routes, and travel papers take forever to get processed.

      We'll actually mention this aspect later in the season.

> I'm assuming that this was intentional?

      No, so far, I'd say your analysis was quite good.  To some
extent, you also have to go outside strict Greek storytelling structure
in terms of saga and also go into classic Greek theater, especially the
tragedies.

      In that particular form, a character may have a destiny, or
there's a prophecy, and the character does all he can to avoid that
destiny, but everything he does only brings him closer to it. 
Certainly there's a lot of that in Londo, for instance.

      There's also the thematic issues of hubris, of the descent into
the underworld, the oracle, and other elements of Greek and general
mythic storytelling.

                                                                  jms

      Well, most of the actors have split now that filming's over for
the season, scattering to the four winds...but I'd say overall that
they're all very pleased at how their characters have been changed,
what's happened, and seeing how it's been *massively* cranked up for
next season.

      Not the work per se in terms of being influenced, but the
attitude that goes into the work, yes.  I've stood at Stonehenge at
dawn, the place more or less empty, walked along the circular stones at
Avebury, and stood in the deep cavernous center of a pre-bronze age
burial mound in Ireland...when you do these things, you begin to
understand what *time* is, and how we in this country don't really know
what that is yet.  It can affect how you perceive a lot of things, and
in the end, that always feeds back into the writing.

      Franklin's line in Avalon indicates that a couple of ships were
destroyed *and* Dukhat was killed.  You basically had one big convoy
meeting another; the ship on which Dukhat was present was badly damaged
but not destroyed.  Dukhat and a number of others on board were killed.

      Thanks.  That's great to hear.  (Yours is the first reaction
I've seen to the ep.)

      There are a number of medlabs, which are broken into various
areas; each has a larger wing attached to it, which we've seen on
occasion, such as when the young girl in "Legacies" is in the infirmary
in bed, same with Shon in "Believers."  They each have a pretty fair
capacity for patients.

      Beyond that...thanks again.  This is a particularly good
episode, I think, a real turning point in the show.  (And I'm pleased
that this is one ep where I've more or less managed to keep advance
info down to a minimum.) Everyone did a great job.

      Thanks.  Yes, everybody's agendas remain the same...but for the
moment, they are on the same alignment.  As soon as it's over, as
Ivanova says, he'll turn on them, no mistake.  Enlightened
self-interest, nothing more.

      The new command center was cobbled from what's on the station,
with some additional Minbari funding.  And yes, by now, pretty much the
whole crew knows what's at stake with the shadows.  And now that
they're not hiding anymore, the whole *thing* is out in the open.

      Those were the last remaining ones, the older telepaths, their
children all killed, too old now to produce any further children, and
the technology of cloning or genetics was still way beyond them.

      The story of the last crusade of G'Quan is actually quite
interesting; I hope to get it into the show at some point.  Right now
it's mainly background, even though I've worked it out fully.

      It varies; some aspects are extensively mapped out, some are

      I think I'd rather hold it for now, on the chance that I can use
it somewhere, or in time turn it into something larger.

      The name of the Ranger pin is spelled Isil'zha.  I'll have to
look up the other word.

      The Minbari term for Ranger One, btw, is Entil'zha.

      Z'ha'dum is where the shadows live.  Odd, that reversal....

      Since we're not using the casino much this season -- not a lot
of room for frivolity -- we yanked it out and put up the war room on
stage C.

      It'll be a long time before Bester's ladyfriend comes anywhere
near being whole again.

      It wasn't that they didn't know about the gun ports, they did,
it's just that since the start of the war, they hadn't run into any
Minbari warships that did this, there was no reason for it...until they
learned what was going on.  For all they knew, it could've been
trouble.

                                                                   jms

      That's correct, yes.

      Certainly, that there were no teeps on Narn made them easy
targets, as were their ships.  They would also have a vested interest
in subduing them because of the knowledge they have, revealed here.  If
you'll remember, in "Matters of Honor," they mention to Morden that
they've only been able to track down some Narn legends.  Morden's
reply: "Well, we've taken care of that problem."  Had G'Kar not been
out and about, they might have succeeded.

      No, I agree, that a serious inquiry can merit good responses
that lead to the person checking out the show.  It's just when somebody
comes in and demands or tells you to "defend" the show, I've never yet
seen a situation where the person had any interest in the answer...they
just like to see people have to defend themselves on that which does
not require defense.

      I've been on the nets 15 years...I know all the routines by
heart.

      I suppose it could be uploaded (if included with proper link

can check it out.

      Actually, the teaser you saw isn't from the two-parter, it's
from "Interludes and Examinations," which airs just before "War."

      No, apparently the rights negotations between the production
company and the apparent rights owner (First) ran into unresolved
rights questions from Ostrander, who says *he* has the rights...and now
it'll have to go into arbitration.  Since it'll take 90 days to
conclude that arbitration, that'll eat up my window of opportunity to
do the script before B5 would get going for year four...so it'll have
to wait at least a year now.

Subject: JMS: gun port=respect?

{original post unavailable}

      It goes back a long time...if you look at certain members of the
animal kingdom, they will often flash their teeth or growl to establish
their identity, to show equality with someone else.  You have to step
outside a human perspective and ask how an alien would show respect,
which may not be how we would logically do so.  (Heck, in many cultures
here on earth, a perfectly normal habit -- crossing your legs and the
bottom of your foot showing -- is taken as a grave insult in some
cultures.  Certain customs are deeply rooted in cultural backgrounds or
incidents that are often incomprehensible to us.)
