      It just sorta worked out that way; it wasn't something we did or
he asked for intentionally.  Some things happen through a weird,
organic kind of synchronicity.  That's one of them.

Subject: UK B5 Screening Now Free

      The London screening of "In the Beginning" late in July was
always intended to be a free screening.  When I learned that twenty
pounds and more was being charged per ticket for a free screening, I
and Warner Bros. got into this situation, causing a bit of a stir with
the organizers who insisted that this was the way it was supposed to
be, first trying to fob off the money as being for the actors, then
saying that WB wanted the money.

      Well, WB has just confirmed the following: the Wolf con
organizers have been taken out of the loop; the screening is now free,
as it was intended to be; any monies paid will be refunded; and
tentatively, Bruce has agreed to stop by one or both of the screenings
without cost to the fans (this last bit depending on his
schedule/arrival times in the UK).

      This event was always meant to be free to the UK fans as
recognition for their support.  And now it is what it was meant to be.

                                                                  jms

      I have no idea.  But they're going to be at the convention, are
they not?  And virtually everyone who got tickets is also going to the
convention, as far as I've heard.  Either way, though, I  haven't heard
one way or another on this.

                                                                  jms

      I don't know, that's something that will have to be looked into
by the WB video division in Germany.  Maybe if fans push for it there,
they may be able to do something.

      I'm sorry, but there is only ONE Warner Bros.  There are offices
of the company, as with any company, but they are all owed by Warner
Bros. in the United States, here in Burbank, and it was from the main
office that this has come.  There are some folks involved here who are
trying to muddy the situation by saying there are all these different
companies, but there aren't. There is only one IBM, and only one Ford,
and only one Warner Bros. And it's that main office that I've been
dealing with on this.

      Sorry, I am *not* confusing the situation.  It's others who are
trying to blur the facts here.  Perhaps if you were less obviously
trying to justify their activities, you might be able to see that.

"OK, so is anyone going to try to pass *this* one off as non-arc
"filler"?"

      Exactly.  See, that's where I get nuts about some of the other
comments. A number of folks said last week's was just filler...but last
week we saw the process by which Lennier was sent to White Star 27,
what he was looking for, and why...we were introduced to the captain,
the mission...and now this week it pays off.  It seems like the
*result* is considered arc, and the set-up is considered "filler."

      Similarly, Lyta's actions in this episode (and those that are
going to follow) are a direct result of the whole Byron thread, which
is going to spiral further in some interesting directions.  Some said
the Byron stuff was just filler...but it was there to move Lyta into a
whole new direction that will have a substantial effect on the show and
her character (and at least one other).

      It seems to me that repeatedly, people dismiss something new in
the mix as filler or non-arc...when in fact it's ABSOLUTE arc stuff
once you've seen the whole thing.  (Except for those who only seem to
feel that results are arc, not setups, which is as nutty a view as I've
ever heard.)

                                                                  jms

      I wouldn't say she has any sexual interest in G'Kar...she had
her pleasure threshold expanded with Byron just recently, and as for
her parting comment, I think it came more under the category of "you
ain't getting it, but since you were still wondering..."  A friendly
plink.

                                                                  jms

"so that means they were in the loop at some point, and WB knew about
it..."

      That's certainly the party line, being spouted on the Wolf web
site, and repeated by you almost verbatim.

      But nobody ever said Wolf wasn't in the loop...obviously they
were in contact with various people at WB in the first place or the
screening couldn't have been planned in ANY event, at cost or
otherwise.  So this new comeback is utterly silly and absolutely
meaningless.

      The question at hand is how well they were handling the loop.

      Obviously some folks are trying to save face any way they can,
regardless of whether the latest statement actually makes sense or
not.

                                                                  jms

      I know...if I do a bunch of arc episodes in a row, certain
people say it's "obviously rushed."  If I take a more leisurely pace to
develop certain characters and themes, the same folks say it's
"wandering, lost its way."

      The show is what the show is, and what the show is, is what I
wanted to write.

      Thanks, I tend to agree...they are indeed very hard to pull off,

      Well, as G'Kar said in the pilot, there would have to be rather
substantial genetic manipulation and adjustment to allow for the
different DNA structures to mix.

      After that, it would require the usual: dinner, flowers, and
being willing to sit through a chick-flick....

      It was shot for shot what I wrote...but at the same time, a

      Well, do bear in mind that the events in "War" were 17 years
after the fact, so the shadow allies could have come at any time;
Sheridan didn't fully understand what a keeper was, and also bear in
mind that there is no reason to suspect anything in this situation. 
People can indeed start wars without having keepers on them, you know. 
We do it all the time.  He would have to have some overwhelming
proof...and even then, if he says anything to Londo, he might risk
changing the timeline, and that would have potentially disasterous 
consequences.

      Well, the next episode is even more so...and the one after that,

very strongly arc, though, just not as in-your-face hardhitting -- and
then the last are whammers.

      Oh, I still hear plenty from the naysayers...they can't argue
with the quality of the episodes now, so they say, "Well, it's too
little, too late," totally ignoring all that went before to set this
up.

      Screw 'em.  This season, there wasn't any pressure, there wasn't
any fighting for renewal since we knew this was gonna be it, so I wrote
exactly the show that I wanted to write.  As long as more folks like it

      Yeah, that was a visual pun written into the script, the other
shoe dropping...but also reflecting that kind of low energy thing in
the morning, when you put one slipper on, and you just *don't* want to
leave...and you just let the energy drain away, and the slipper falls
from your hand...which also overlaps the gavel dropping, as scripted.

      I took a great deal of care in blocking out every shot in that
one, as opposed to some other cases, as with Mike Vejar, where I wrote,
in "The Face of the Enemy," "They pull down Sheridan like a pack of
wolves bringing down a lion" knowing that he would then take that and
turn it into art.  And he did.

      Thanks, I appreciate that.  And actually, there are 5 more eps
to go; 501 was moved to the end of year 4 as "Deconstruction," so
you've got this next one, then the wait, and the final four.

      Such things are tracked by the dialogue/continuity editor on-

      Well, it's kinda what I've been saying all along...the bigger
the planned wham, the longer the quiet ramp-up.  And, again, the arc
was there when it didn't seem to be: this whole thing started when the
raids started to take place, which goes back quite a ways.  And Lyta
would not be in this position, not this assertive with her abilities,
had she not gone through the fire (literally and figuratively) with
Byron, whose fate more or less kicked her out of her shell.  The old
Lyta would never have just up and gone to the Drazi homeworld on her
own; but the money, needed to follow her and Byron's dream, propelled
her.

      It was ALL there, more or less in plain view.

      And without it, without all that careful and deliberate setup,
this episode (and especially those that follow) would never have played
as well, if at all.

"Actually, it's possible that this is all just a coincidence of
timing. After all, JMS didn't write these episodes knowing when the
breaks in the season would take place. On the other hand, I hate
coincidence and this is one hell of a big one..."

      Funny thing about that.  When I wrote this, this was the first
part of a very tight two parter (well, actually, it's part 4 of a five
parter; if you watch them straight through, one dovetails right smack
into the next, it's one really huge episode).  Anyway, for the fifth
one, the next one to air, I decided to do a recap in the teaser, a
"Previously on Babylon 5..." compilation.  Hadn't done it with the
others, but just decided to do it with this one, since it picks up
seconds after the other.

      Later, after putting it together, in a phone call with TNT, they
told me about the decision to put in a break after this episode.  "So
you may want to consider putting a recap into the teaser, since this is
a two-parter and it's been a long time and that's something you didnt'
anticipate."

      "Well, actually...I already did that."

      A long pause.  "How did you know?"

      "I didn't."

      Scared 'em real good with that one.

      I think I wrote close to 20 or so episodes for that one.  I left
when they decided to make Janine into a mommy-character instead of a
strong character, then did a few more later when they realized they'd
made a mistake and wanted her pulled back again.

"JMS also had his claws into an episode or two of Captain Power:
Soldier of the Future. Perhaps the less said about that the better (the
show had issues - but it actually tried to be more than a kiddie show  -
but it was gruesomely tied down to a toy that they were forced to
market for). I think JMS was just a writer - though I believe Doug
Netter was a producer (he also of B5 fame).

      I was story editor on that one (wrote 11 episodes), Larry
DiTilio (also of B5 and elsewhere) wrote a bunch, Doug Netter was co-
exec producer, and John Copeland was producer, with some EFX work by
Ron Thornton and set design by John Iacovelli.  It was, in many ways, a
test/launching pad for what would become B5.

"So, what do YOU think, Joe?  Do you think Rod Serling would approve
of the new adaptation or his name being attached to it?"

      Unfortunately, I haven't seen it, and tend to shy away from
making any kind of sweeping comments about things I haven't seen.  If I
can take your description as accurate, then my answer would probably be
no.  I would think that by now, we could do the story as he had
intended it to be done. Certainly every generation stories get
reinterpreted; I once saw Two Gentlemen of Verona produced in a 1920s
context, and if the Bard can be shuffled about in time, anybody can.

      That is somewhat different, however, from altering the text or
the dramatic intent.  Herein lay the dilemma.  Do we have any copies of
Rod's original work, as he had intended it to be done?  Or were they
working off the only version, the altered one?  If so, then it's
altered one more iteration from something that was not the proper
version anyway, so yes, it's off course, but is it demonstrably more
off-course than the original softened version?

      On the other hand, if they did have the original version, it
would have been better served to go with that...however, if they did
so, the odds are that the SciFi Channel would never have produced it,
since there's nothing SF about it.

      I dunno...again, I haven't seen it, so I'm trying to be measured
in my comments.

"Also, to get this somewhat back on topic, do you agree with Harlan
Ellison's "scorched earth" policy with regard to unfinished works?  If
you had suffered a fatal stroke a year or so ago, would you have
approved of someone else stepping in to finish B5 "just the way Joe
would've wanted it" or for B5 to have died with you?  Would you want
your unfinished works archived, with the ever-present possibility that
someone might later acquire "rights" to produce them, or used as fuel
for your funeral pyre?"

      I don't want anybody rifling through my stuff and putting it out
there after I'm gone, especially in unfinished form.  I come to this
opinion by a hard road; when doing Twilight Zone, I was assigned to
write a teleplay based on one of Rod's unproduced outlines, and for me
that was one of the highlights since it let me kind of see into his
creative process a little, and the story was a good one.  At the time,
the issue of posthumous literary use really hadn't occured to me. 
Since then, I've had a great deal of time to think about it, and have
finally come down on the side of "no."  If I had expired prior to
finishing B5, I would rather let it end at that than have someone else
finish it for me, in a way not what I would've wanted...as a painter 
would not generally let someone else finish his painting after his
passing.

                                                                  jms
