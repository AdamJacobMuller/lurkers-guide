Carlson to closer match dimensions shown in "Points of Departure")

Areas of Interest:
      Yellow Sector:    Non rotating sections, 0g cargo bays, Fusion Engines,
                        etc.
      Blue Sector:      Maintenance and operations areas such as the docking
                        bays, the Customs areas ("Customs sector"), and the
                        Observation Dome/C&C.  There are hospitals and
                        Medlabs.  Some living areas, the Sanctuary and the
                        Rotunda.  There are 70 Decks in the narrower part of
                        the hull.
      Red Sector:       Wraps around The Garden. Marketplace and business
                        areas such as the Zocolo, Hotel suites, casinos, bars,
                        brothels, a bookstore;
      The Garden        A large botanical area that runs the center,
                        lengthwise, of the station.  It is an O'Neill
                        environment, which enables an observer to look
                        straight up to the other side of the rotating section. 
                        Lining the circular wall are some farmlands, orchards,
                        an open air hedge maze, fields, trees, artificial
                        lakes, Hydroponics gardens and other areas for oxygen
                        reclamation.  There are other areas where alien food
                        is grown, as well as an area where food that is
                        impractical to grow is synthesized.  Other foods are
                        imported.  Weather can occur in the Garden area.
      Green Sector:     Wraps around The Garden. Ambassadorial Suites.
      Gray Sector:      Wraps around The Garden.  Alien Sector (qv).  Waste
                        reclaimation area at Hull, Deck 49-51.
      Brown Sector:     May or may not partially wrap around The Garden. 
                        There are at least 90-91 Decks between the Axis and
                        the Hull.
      DownBelow:        The Slum areas below the main levels (the higher G
                        sections?)
      Topside:          The main, public areas.
      Dockside:         The Cargo handling areas and docking bays.
      Water and Waste reclamation systems are on decks 49-51 of blue and gray
      sectors.
      There are various embassies and diplomatic missions from various worlds. 
      Because space on B5 is so tight, complete offices for every single
      ambassador would kill most of the available space; so they have access
      to the station's facilities for business rooms, meeting rooms,
      conference rooms and the like.

Internal Coordinates:
      These are based first on color, denoting a "ring" or "sector", each
      technically separate, but interconnected.  These consist of Blue, Gray,
      Red, Green, Brown, etc.; then one of 36 "sector" numbers (Perhaps each
      denoting a 10 degree region around the station's circumference); then a
      "level" or a deck number (for instance Blue 15A).

B5 Dimensions:
      According to the Map in "Points of Departure" the station's total length
      is X; the diameter of the largest rotating cross section is .094X; the
      maximum length of heat radiator vanes from "top" to "bottom" is .26X.
      The Fork/stabilizer is aproximately .094X long, although it only extends
      .075X out from the main body of the station. It, and all non-rotating
      sections are coded as Yellow. The foremost rotating section (the face of
      which is .04X in diameter.) is colored Blue, and extends for .189X.  The
      next section is Gray and is .019X long. The next, Red, section is .047X
      long. The next section is of a darker color that may be Brown is .085X
      long. The next section is Green and is .075X long.  The next section is
      dark, and is .057X long.  Thus the rotating section is .547X long.  The
      section housing the radiator vanes is .103X long and the final section,
      housing the fusion reactors is .35X long.

            Total Length            8000 meters

            Station Mass:          2.5x10^12 grams (Minimum)
                                4x10^12   grams (Estimated)
            Station's Actual Gravity based on Mass:
                                2.7x10^-13 cm/s^2 (Minimum)
                                4.34x10^13 cm/s^2 (Estimated)
            Orbital Radius (Estimated): 100,000 km and 100,000 km behind E-3-A

      Location:
            Grid "Epsilon" 470x18x22.  The Station orbits a barren, seemingly
            lifeless planet "Epsilon 3" (aka Euphrates*) in the L5 postition
            between the planet and a small, gray moon.  The planet orbits
            "near" Epsilon Eridani (Epsilon or Tigris*) in neutral space, more
            or less central to all five of the major governments (nw).  [JMS
            said initial that Euphrates was a Binary system (25-30 ly from
            Earth), though this may have changed.]
            B1-B4 were located in roughly the same sector, with B4 using some
            of the materials from 1-3 leftover.  B5 was constructed about 3
            hours (traveling time in real-space) from the location of B4.
            [B4 was refered to as being in "Sector 14" (bs) while "Sector 7"
            is "Almost on top of" the station (nw) and "Sector 10" is very
            nearby.]
      Description:
            The non-rotating "fork" portion of the station "over" the rotating
            landing bays sits astride a 0 G cargo handling bay.  The "fork"
            extends into a flat non-rotating section that runs the length of
            the station to the heat radiator vanes.  Behind them extends the
            fusion reactor section that extends over a third of the length of
            the station.  "Below" the reactor, several kms away from the
            station, floats a "Hazardous Materials Storage" site.  The station
            is spun for simulated gravity, ranging from 0 G along the axis to
            about 2 Gs on the lowest deck.
      Areas of Interest:
            Yellow Sector:    Non rotating sections, 0g cargo bays, Fusion
                              Engines, etc.
      Living Areas:
            There are living areas designed to accomodate different
            environments, atmospheres, etc.  Some of the alien sections are
            uninhabitable to humans without protective breathing gear or other
            measures.  Similarly, heavy CO2 breathers or methane breathers
            have to wear some sort of respirators or "encounter suits" to
            travel among the humans on the station.  The station's life
            support systems are capable of handling 250,000 entities, mostly
            in the form of transient population.
            Only the executive suites have sufficient water for traditional
            bathing facilities.  The rest of the personnel make due with
            sonics showers.
            The primary means of transportation within the station are the
            transport tubes, similar to elevators moving from level to level;
            and the core shuttle, which travels along the axis in 0 G.  The
            station operates on Earth Standard/Earth Mean Time, as well as
            running on human cycles of day and night, with the lighting in the
            hallways and Garden bright during the day times, and dark during
            night.
      Personnel:
            Most of the humans on the station are civilian contractees,
            handling things such as dockwork, food preparation, and so forth,
            under contracts with the government.  Operations, such as the
            techs in the Observation Dome, the Medical Staff, and Security are
            Earthforce.  There are 1500 Guild Dockworkers, and 6500 Earthforce
            Personnel.
      Defensive Capabilities:
            Until 2259, the station was protected by a low level Defense Grid
            containing a variety of concealed hull mounted weaponry, which
            were supplemented by Starfury wings housed in "Cobra Bays".
            The Alpha, Delta and Zeta wings consist of 12 Starfurys each.
            After the beginning of the Narn-Centauri Conflict, in 2259, the
            station's defenses were upgraded with Pulse Cannons...
      Internal Coordinates:
            These are based first on color, denoting a "ring" or "sector",
            each technically separate, but interconnected.  These consist of
            Blue, Gray, Red, Green, Brown, etc.; then one of 36 "sector"
            numbers (each denoting a 10 degree region around the station's
            circumference*); then a "level" or a deck number (for instance
            Blue 15A).
            There are various "locator Graphics", pictograms using dots to
            identify beings (Three dots on a line above and through three
            larger circles for the Core Shuttle; a single dot over a slanted
            bar for licing quarters; six dots to either side of a bar for a
            meeting room; etc.
      Legal Status:
            The Station acts as a free port, a place of commerce, trade,
            diplomacy, where different parties can meet to work out their
            problems so the legal situation can be tricky.  Technically,
            outside of the station is in neutral territory, while only within
            the station are EA laws and regulations enforceable.  These
            regulations are VERY strict.  Anyone coming onto the station must
            be scanned for weapons, since no weapons are allowed on the
            station.
            In most everyday situations B5 operates fairly autonomously; Earth
            doesn't generally get involved unless there's a good reason.
            The commander of B5 is empowered to speak on behalf of his
            government the say that a ship's captain exploring new worlds is
            similarly empowered.  He is on equal footing with the Alien
            ambassadors.  He is forbidden from using the Station's personnel
            or firepower to, for instance, threaten someone into signing a
            particular treaty, since that would be considered duress, and
            therefore void.
      Financial Conditions:
            The Station is owned and operated by the Earth Alliance, and
            although the EA funded the first few attempts exclusively; after
            they'd dumped all their money into B4, they needed outside funding
            to get B5 going.  The Minbari were first to contribute money as a
            show of good faith. Then the Centauri added additional funding. 
            Those are the only two other races that've contributed
            significantly.
            Because of this financial "burden", anyone who stays on the
            station pays a fee.  Station employees are charged a similar fee
            against their salaries.  Even the command staff may be required to
            pay for their "room and board".   As soon as a ship enters through
            the Jump Gate, its "signature" is registered and the fee for using
            Gate is debited to the account or taxes of the ship's owner.  If
            they don't have an account, they will be asked for payment before
            being allowed to "land."
