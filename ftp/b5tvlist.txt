  United States
  
   Babylon 5 is not currently airing in the United States. It will return
   in January 1998 on cable network TNT. See the US episode list page of
   the Lurker's Guide at
   http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/countries/us/eplist.html for schedule
   details.
   
  Canada
  
   CITY-TV is allegedly working on buying rights to season five.
   
   The "Space" cable channel is also in negotiations to show B5; they ask
   that viewers please not contact them about it. It's being worked on
   already and they have limited staff to answer the hundreds of E-mail
   messages they get on the subject -- they're already quite exasperated
   by the flow of "Is there news yet?" mail. If and when there's news
   from them you'll see it here.

    Station Notes
    
   If a station airs B5 at midnight, it is listed for the actual day it
   airs, thus 'Sun 12:00am' is late night Saturday.
   
   * Stations with an '*' have been known to move B5 around a lot for
   sports, so double check your listings to make sure when things are in
   season.
