    B5 NOVELS
    
    The first batch of original B5 novels will be put out by Dell. The first

    Christopher Franke's B5 soundtrack will be released on his label, Sonic
    Images. A special limited edition is available now, with a general release
    coming in early 1995. 
    
    B5 COMICS
    
    Issue #1 of DC's Babylon 5 comic, written by JMS, is "In Darkness Find Me,"
    the flip-side of incidents that took place in "Points of Departure." The
    artists are Michael Netzer and Rob Leigh. Issue #1 shows Sinclair being
    recalled to Earth and assigned to Minbar. 
    
    The next seven issues of the comic are based on premises by JMS as well.
    Issues 2-4 are written by Mark Moretti. Sinclair begins his new role as
    Earth's first ambassador to Minbar as the Grey Council convenes to install
    the new Minbari leader, and a Psi-Cop arrives on B5 with news about a plot
    to assassinate that leader. Issues 5-8 will be written by Tim DeHaas with
    art by John Ridgeway. The story of how Sinclair and Garibaldi met and
    formed their friendship is intercut with a present-day story featuring
    Garibaldi and Keffer.

    The CD-ROM from Compton's is postponed indefinitely because of internal
    problems within the company. JMS has stated he expects it in Summer 1995.

    Finally, look for the first release of B5 videotapes (first season
