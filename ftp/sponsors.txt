RESULTS: Babylon 5 sponsor survey (12/8/94)

Below is a table of national sponsors of Babylon 5, surveyed over a
period of several weeks.  Following the table is a set of mailing
addresses of the most frequent sponsors.  B5 fans who want to express
support directly to the sponsors may wish to write to those addresses.
However, this should be done only after having written to their local
television station first.

NOTES/METHODS:

(1) Only the number of advertising spots and the number of episodes
sponsored (out of the four episodes surveyed) have been counted,
rather than the total amount of time purchased.

(2) Locally-identified companies or non-commercial promos were
excluded from the table, although a few national products (such as
automobiles) may have actually been placed only locally.

(3) The count was based on first-run (Wednesday) broadcast on WSBK
channel 38, Boston.  Advertising appearing from between the teaser
through to the credits was included, but not those immediately before
or after.

(4) The count was based on FOUR recent episodes: Revelations
(11/9/94), Geometry of Shadows (11/16/94), The Long Dark (11/30/94),
and Spider in the Web (12/7/94).

(5) This effort has been entirely on my own initiative.  Any errors
are certainly mine.  I do not work for any of the sponsors.  Although
I think that this bit of research may have been useful, I am not
planning to continue the survey.  Someone who tapes the show is
welcome to do a more obsessive job, using a stopwatch.
