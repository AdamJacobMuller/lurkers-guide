+-----------------------------------+

I am retiring the Babylon 5 FAQ because it has been made obsolete by the
large number of other resources available on the World Wide Web.  There
isn't really a need for a FAQ anymore in today's WWW world.

Time-dependent information has been removed from this final version, which
means that this entire part (B) of the FAQ has been gutted.

Files like this tend to get archived for a while, so I am publishing a
final version to stay in the various archives so it doesn't appear that
a new version is forthcoming.

For the latest information on Babylon 5, I direct you to:

http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/lurker.html
for the highly detailed "Lurker's Guide to Babylon 5."

http://www.thestation.com/home.html
for a wide range of merchandise and collectables.

http://tnt.turner.com/babylon5/
for the latest information in U.S. airings.

These sites, or sites pointed to by these sites, should hold the information
you need to keep up on Babylon 5.
