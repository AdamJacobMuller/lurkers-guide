       Official Transcript of a formal real-time Conference with
        J. Michael Straczynski, held Sunday, May 21st, 1995, in
                DELPHI's Science Fiction & Fantasy SIG.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.Gordie>  
   Good evening, everyone, and welcome to DELPHI's Science Fiction & 
   Fantasy SIG.  For the last few months, we've been having special 
   Conferences with authors, giving them an opportunity to share a 
   little insight into how they work, and where they might be going.  
   Tonight, while seemingly unlike our last few Conferences, we 
   actually have a rather similar situation.  Joe Straczynski is a 
   writer and not just of individual television episodes, although he 
   most certainly does that, too.  He has written a couple of novels 
   as well, and as soon as he finishes with some, ah, other commitments, 
   I suspect he will write others.  But what sets Joe apart from the 
   rest of the crowd is a vision he has.  A vision to create a whole 
   new form of storytelling.  The vision we have all come to know 
   as Babylon 5.  I hope Joe will share some of his vision with us 
   tonight, both for that literary form in general, and for the 
   television gem, Babylon 5, specifically.

   <Guidelines for online behavior snipped.>

   With that out of the way, I'll open the floor to Joe for any opening 
   comments he might like to make.  Joe?

STRACZYNSKI> 
   Many folks have noticed that I'm on a LOT of systems, and have 
   wondered if it's really me making all these replies.  I wish to 
   state categorically that it IS me writing all those messages, but 
   since there is a limit on time, obviously this is not actually me 
   in this conference, but rather someone that I have hired to pretend 
   to be me while I'm off pretending to be Rondo Hatton, standing on 
   the ledge of a large building, and I'll jump, I swear, I'll jump.

   Go ahead.  Ask questions.  See if I care.  (Boy, is that a long 
   drop.)  ga

ALLBELL> 
   Do you ever lurk in newsgroups for other shows? Do you find your 
   reactions differ when you're in the groups for the other shows? ga

STRACZYNSKI> 
   No, in general, I don't much lurk in other groups for other shows; 
   I have a hard enough time keeping up with all the B5 groups.  
   Though I do from time to time lurk on other B5 groups, so that I 
   can see what folks are saying when they don't think I'm around, 
   because I'm concerned that my presence sometimes may influence a 
   group.  Unvarnished opinion is a sobering but educational thing.  ga

ALLBELL> 
   Have you gotten any ideas about universe building from the flamewars, 
   etc. that go on on the Internet?

STRACZYNSKI> 
   Negative.  The only thing that flamewars do is to give me the chance 
   to try out new Ivanova lines (or lines that BECOME Ivanova lines) 
   about one's genetic ancestry, cerebral capacity, and other 
   wonderfulnesses.  ga

.Lemming> 
   What became of the unmade season 1 Gerrold scripts?  Will they be 
   made?  Will there be more Gerrold scripts?  Thanks, GA

STRACZYNSKI> 
   There are no unproduced Gerrold scripts.  There were, as I recall, 
   two outlines that never got to script, but no scripts per se; one of 
   those outlines will be coming out as a two-parter in the B5 comic, 
   so nothing goes to waste. ga

.Lemming> 
   This is not really unrelated, but bothering me, in _Knives_, Londo 
   went one way, his sword the other, then it's back in his hand.  Is 
   this a production glitch or did a shadow push it over?  Thanks, keep 
   up the great work! GA

STRACZYNSKI> 
   I think that's a camera thing; we shot that in master and close 
   during that sequence, and the thing landed where it was supposed to; 
   Londo grabbed forward for it, but I think in the close shot we used, 
   you can't really see how far he's had to reach forward, which may 
   account for the discrepency. ga

.Elric> 
   I have a two part question. 1, It seems that the FOX affiliate in this 
   area has pushed the B5 episodes back to the wee hours of the morning 
   instead of the 10:00 slot it once had. Is the B5 series in danger of 
   being dropped (God forbid) ?!?!? And secondly, in an episode several 
   weeks ago, they opened the novelty shops and I noticed some models of 
   the B5 station and of a Starfury. Can fans order these things? If not 
   will they ever be available? ga

STRACZYNSKI> 
   Stations have the option of airing the show pretty much whenever 
   they so desire; sometimes they shift it good, sometimes they shift 
   it bad.  It has no real impact on our chances, except in the 
   cumulative ratings, if enough put us in crummy slots...  
   As for the toys used, they were just made up for that episode, and 
   don't exist in reality, nor are they for sale anywhere though you 
   can take a pretty good guess where the Londo and G'Kar dolls ended 
   up, and where the station model will end up after the series is 
   finished.  ga  (Daffy duck voice: MINE, MINE, MINE!)

.Gumby> 
   Any truth to the rumour that Sheridan is history and that Sinclair 
   is back as Station Commander in the 3rd season? ga

STRACZYNSKI> 
   The rumor is not true. ga

.Gumby> 
   As well, how much input do you have in the novels and comics (which 
   are both great, by the way)... ga

STRACZYNSKI> 
   Total and complete.  I review both in detail in outline and in 
   draft form, I approve the script/pencils/inks in the comic, suggest 
   stories, and I'm writing a 4-issue arc.  The 3rd novel was a bit 
   off-kilter (no fault of John's), and I sent it back for considerable 
   revisions, which put it back a month, but I'd rather have it right 
   than fast. ga

.Gumby> 
   Right on !!

.Gordie> 
   Are there any plans to do some kind of multimedia product?

STRACZYNSKI> 
   Yes, a CD rom is in the works, but not for a while yet.  I'm less 
   interested in ancillary marketing, merchandising, and all that 
   than just Telling The Story.  I've seen merchandising get in the 
   way too often.  ga

.John> 
   Will Commander (ambassador) Sinclair and his organization play a larger 
   part in the upcoming season or is he bowing out of the show? ga

STRACZYNSKI> 
   All I can say for now is that we will see a lot more of the Rangers 
   in the coming season (assuming we're renewed).  As for the rest, I'd 
   rather hold back just now. ga

.CompuJohn> 
   Are the rumors true that the last 4 episodes of season 2 won't be 
   shown in the US until October ?

STRACZYNSKI> 
   Yes, they are correct.  Ain't my decision.  The Powers That Be 
   figure that if they hold off the last 4, they can use them to lead 
   up to the start of the (hopefully) new season in November, and get 
   us off to a good start.  They say that HUTS (Households Using TV) 
   figures are very low for June, July and August, since everybody's out. 
   In September, you're right up against the new blockbuster network 
   shows, and their PR machine, so that leaves October.  My opinion...  
   ...is my opinion.  ga   (I can chew glass too when required.)

.CompuJohn> 
   B5 has just the right amount of humor sprinkled in... Is the wall 
   hanging of Daffy Duck in Garibaldi's room available in stores? GA

STRACZYNSKI> 
   Yeah, I think it's a commercial print, so it probably is.  ga
   (It may be on velvet.)

.Neil> 
   Hi Joe.  Dunno if you remember me, but I was six inches and 90 
   degrees to your left at the I-Con banquet last year.  I've heard a 
   rumor that you're considering compressing the series should a year 
   four not look to be in the cards.  Total BS?  Or is it still a total 
   fight for survival on your end?

STRACZYNSKI> 
   I'm not sure it CAN be condensed, and certainly I have no current 
   plans in that area.  But it's always a fight to get this thing done 
   right, and to see it through to the end.  But if it was easy, 
   everybody'd be doing it.  ga

.Neil> 
   Yeah, the offer I made before to send a screener of that film I 
   translated still stands.  Interested at all?

STRACZYNSKI> 
   Would you like to see the stack of tapes on my desk that I haven't 
   looked at yet?  I appreciate the offer, but....

.Neil> 
   Gotcha...  Maybe some year...

STRACZYNSKI> 
   ...my time is zilch; the only films I've seen in the last 9 months 
   have been on airlines.  24 hours a day, B5 is my life. ga

.Colin> 
   There are many subtle (and not so subtle) references to classic SF. To 
   what extent have you been influenced by EE Doc Smith's Lensman series? 
   (Humans bail out the galaxy.) (Or for that matter, Heinlein, Clarke, 
   movies, etc...)  ga

STRACZYNSKI> 
   I've been influenced in a generic sense, rather than in any 
   particulars; I grew up on the big sagas of SF and fantasy literature 
   and I'd always wondered why nobody ever did something on that scale 
   for TV, and the answer is, "Because nobody's done it." ....
   So I figured, may as well be me.  As for specifics, I grew up on 
   all the main writers of the genre... Heinlein, Clarke, Bradbury, 
   Ellison, Matheson, Asimov, you name it...plus my models in many other 
   ways were writers like Norman Corwin, Rod Serling, Paddy Chayefsky, 
   Reginald Rose and others who loved language and weren't afraid to 
   have someone talking for more than 2 lines at a time. ga

.Colin> 
   Thanks. Just wanted to say that I really look forward to each episode, 
   and enjoy everything except the size (or rather lack thereof) of the 
   comic. Any plans to expand it? ga

STRACZYNSKI> 
   No, all DC comics are the same length, 24 pages.  That's immobile. ga

.NumberSix> 
   This follows nicely upon Colin's question.  The references to 
   _The_Prisoner_ in B5 are fairly clear, and I've started some 
   discussions here and elsewhere as to whether there is an equivalent 
   to No. 6 in B5.  Any comments? ga

STRACZYNSKI> 
   First, there is a difference between a nod and a one-to-one 
   reference or template; if you look for ANY character in B5 to echo 
   somebody else in another story or series, you won't find it; I didn't 
   work 5 years to sell this thing just to do the Prisoner or Lord of 
   the Rings with the serial numbers filed off; this is a unique and 
   independent story; I nod out of respect, not to leave a knive where I 
   have extracted something.  Second: the REAL number six would NEVER 
   identify himself as such... so I conclude that you are an IMPOSTER!  
   Delphi police, arrest this man! ga

ALLBELL> 
   He is not a free man. He is a number.

.NumberOne> 
   Thanks!  And yes, there is much more to B5 than a Prisoner clone.

STRACZYNSKI> 
   (The B5 CD soundtrack is playing as I type this.  Buy it.  It's 
   great.)

.Rich_L> 
   Was it your intention to make the Shadows insectile to generate a fear 
   reflex in the viewers, or did it just end up that way? GA

STRACZYNSKI> 
   Certainly when I thunk them up, I wanted them to scare the bejeezus 
   out of people when they appeared; we went through several different 
   design elements, and that was the one that creeped me out the most, 
   and thus we went with that one...  I'm not sure I said, going in, 
   "I want big honking bugs," but what we got, I like, and when you look 
   real close they're not quite as insectlike as they may appear.  Very 
   alien looking.  ga

.Rich_L> 
   It scared my wife enough to give her nightmares for a week... Any 
   chance we will see more of the enigmatic aliens that Sinclair's 
   fiance encountered that one episode? I liked them a lot.

STRACZYNSKI> 
   Hurm.........no comment.  ga

GRAGEM> 
   Do you know when the pilot will be released or rebroadcast?

STRACZYNSKI> 
   My hope is that it'll be soonish, summer or fall, but I don't know 
   that for a fact.  ga

.Rob> 
   Artifical intelligence is already under development in today's time.  
   Will we learn that sophisticated, human-level artificial intelligence 
   has been been perfected by B5's time and is in commercial and/or 
   govermental use?  As an aside, I *want* a Sheridan Bear (I assume you 
   can be bribed?:)

STRACZYNSKI> 
   I can't be bribed, but I can be rented...

.Gumby> 
   <lol> :)

STRACZYNSKI> 
   I've kind of set aside a lot of the AI stuff, on the grounds that 
   it kinda gets in the way, and once all the fooforah is done with, I 
   suspect that people will want their computer systems to be seen and 
   not heard, and reasonably obedient.  Certainly the B5 system is very 
   intuitive, but not AI in the sense that we've come to expect it might 
   be.  I dunno...every time I think about trying it, I see Twikki, and 
   I fall down.  "Open the pod bay doors, Hal."  Ehhh...I just dunno. ga

.Rob> 
   ::chuckle::  What's up with Keffer?  Will he back?  Will he stick 
   around?  Will he play a more involved role in the story?

STRACZYNSKI> 
   The last four episodes of this season show Keffer a lot more.  (We 
   build a little of that in the next ep) ga

DEBGREEN> 
   How do feel about using things routinely today, that were SF 50 years 
   ago?

STRACZYNSKI> 
   I suppose on one level, it's amazing, as you say, but at the same 
   time, what was incredible 100 years ago was perfectly real 50 years 
   ago, it's part of human social and scientific evolution.  I think if 
   we weren't constantly amazed, we'd be dead, but on one level, I think 
   we kind of take it for granted after a while.  (I used to own a Kaypro 
   II with 64K and a 180K floppy, and now I have 2 gig, a 17" monitor, 
   with amazing facilities and 64MEGS ram and it ain't enough yet.  We 
   are engaged in the parade of humanity toward the future, and imagining 
   it is fascinating for what is, and what isn't done...  
   "Just Imagine," a B&W SF MUSICAL in the 1930s showed life in the 1980s, 
   50 years hence, with private aircars, pills instead of food, people 
   with numbers instead of names, and little/none of it's true.  It's 
   scattergun.  We live in the future; it's ALL amazing.  ga

DEBGREEN> 
   When do you expect to find out about next season's pick-up/cancellation?

STRACZYNSKI> 
   We keep hoping on an almost daily basis to get the word; the folks 
   who make the decision will be back in town come Monday, so with luck 
   we'll hear something this week.  ga

SLOMICHAEL> 
   If KOSH is one of the few remaining old ones, and the Vorlons helped 
   fight with the old ones a 1000 years ago, does this mean he is not 
   a Vorlon or there is only one Vorlon-him?  Also I believe that the 
   Minbari on the planet below Babylon 5 will be seen again in the fifth 
   season. ga

STRACZYNSKI> 
   Kosh is a Vorlon.  The Vorlons fought the Shadows.  There are many 
   Vorlons, back home.  (The Writer committed an error in that he used 
   too many pronouns in that segment of dialogue.)  And we'll see Draal 
   again *this* season.  ga

.Lor> 
   Will we see the original doctor (from the pilot) again or hear more 
   about what happened to him?

STRACZYNSKI> 
   See?  No, no plans for now.  Hear about?  Yes.  ga

.Lor> 
   This season? Or later? GA

STRACZYNSKI> 
   Sorta/kinda both. ga

.Lor> 
   Thanks! GA

CEKELLEY> 
   With the war started, and only two seasons down with three to go 
   how much/how often can we expect to see space and or GroPo combat 
   scenes? ga

STRACZYNSKI> 
   Not that much gropo stuff, but you're going to be seeing a LOT more 
   space combat stuff, particularly later this season.  There's some 
   amazing stuff coming, including probably the single biggest engagement 
   we've shown yet.  Something on the order of a dozen fleet-sized capital 
   ships, plus a couple hundred fighters wizzing around, new and unusual 
   weapons, and some long-range tactical strategy, rather than everything 
   at close range (several thousand klicks apart). Nifty stuff.  ga

.Gumby> 
   Cool !

PATGIBBS> 
   What are the prospects for a successful letter writing campaign to 
   reverse the PTN decision to delay broadcast of the last 4 Season 2 
   episodes from June to October?  ga

STRACZYNSKI> 
   If I were to comment on this, or suggest anything, it could be 
   problematic in my relationship with PTEN.  Verstehen Sie?  ga

PATGIBBS> 
   Does PTEN know and or care about the success of B5 on the net? GA

STRACZYNSKI> 
   Stark cold reality: if you added up every single person on the nets 
   who watches B5, it wouldn't be .0001 in the ratings and that's all 
   they care about.  I'm here out of respect for the fans, as part of an 
   experiment, to get a sense of the room and to learn more about my 
   characters by answering questions; I don't think the networks really 
   understand/care about the nets sui generis. ga

.Clint> 
   Can you give us a hint about why Mars is important?  Is there a link 
   to the Shadows? ga

STRACZYNSKI> 
   Possible.  Look for the conclusion of, and the current story arc 
   in, the comic as now being published.  GA

.High Res> 
   In comic #1, Rathenn tells Sinclair that the soul migration has been 
   going on for nearly six thousand years.  In "Points of Departure," 
   Lennier tells Sheridan that it's been going on for a much shorter time 
   period--one or two thousand years, I forget which.  Would you be 
   willing to comment on the discrepancy between the two time periods? ga

STRACZYNSKI> 
   Rathenn spoke incorrectly.  ga

.High Res> 
   In book #2, Accusations, why does G'Kar appear on the cover and not 
   in the book? And, on page 252, there's a brief reference to Sinclair. 
   Was that a typo? That's all. ga

STRACZYNSKI> 
   The covers were done in advance of the books being written; I'm not 
   thrilled about this, because it can be as misleading as our promos 
   tend to be.  This will, one hopes, be amended in future.  ga

.High Res> 
   And the reference to Sinclair? ga

STRACZYNSKI> 
   Which reference?

.High Res> 
   Right after the Joint Chiefs of Staff schedule a review for Ivanova,
   and it cuts to action with the Asimov docking on the station. The next 
   sentence starts out "Sinclair" and then switches to Sheridan. ga

STRACZYNSKI> 
   Typo.  Not My Fault.  ga

.phil athans> 
   Is there any opportunity for freelance writers like me to write 
   for B5?  And if so, how does one start that process? ga

STRACZYNSKI> 
   In the past, I've always tried to stay open to newbies, and the 
   like, but in this case, bear in mind that we're not looking for 
   outside stories.  We've GOT all the stories.  I don't take pitches, 
   I assign stories out of my outline to writers, usually writers I've 
   worked with before, or who come with sterling credentials.  So, alas, 
   we're kinda closed. ga

.phil athans> 
   Oh well... Have you thought about a role-playing game based on B5? ga

STRACZYNSKI> 
   Would love one.  Nobody's approached us formally yet. ga

.phil athans> 
   I'd be willing to try. ga

52RANGER> 
   A steely eye just opened at Wizards of the Coast ;)

STRACZYNSKI> 
   You have to have your company, or A company, approach WB and 
   formally license the thing. ga

.Gordie> 
   Let me sneak one in here...  How do you decide how much of the greater 
   arc to reveal each week?  The balance between saying too much and not 
   saying enough has to be tricky.

STRACZYNSKI> 
   Mainly, you just have to feel your way through on instinct and 
   planning.  For instance, in planning for the (hopefully) third year, 
   I pulled out my notes, and 22 index cards.  Went through my series 
   outline, and picked the eventsI needed at the start of 2260, and the 
   end; then pulled out all the other incidents that had to happen in 
   that year, and began assigning one-two to each card, putting the cards 
   in order so I could see the whole season at a glance if an item seems 
   light, I may pair it up with another incident, or if it's too arc-heavy, 
   pull it out and pair it up with a lighter episode.  It's all very 
   subjective.  ga

.Gordie> 
   So the pacing really got locked in when you came up with the whole arc.

STRACZYNSKI> 
   Mostly.  There's some room to maneuver in there, so I can slide stuff 
   around to make things interesting, and keep the arc fresh but in 
   general, yeah, it's set.  It's a novel, with outline.  You always veer 
   a bit once you hit the book/script, but for the most part, it's set. ga

.Brendan> 
   I've missed several crucial episodes both this season and last. Are 
   there any plans to release old eps into syndication or on video once 
   the series' run is complete? ga

STRACZYNSKI> 
   This season will be rerun to within an inch of its life.  First 
   season will not, on the theory that folks'll get confused by seeing 
   a new CO, though I understand that the tapes for year one will be 
   out later this summer.  ga

.Gordie> 
   Your theory, or Someone Else's?  <g>

STRACZYNSKI> 
   Not mine, jack. ga

.Brendan> 
   One more quick yes-no question: Was Sinclair's departure planned from
   the start?

STRACZYNSKI> 
   That's a much harder question to answer than you know; but I'll try 
   to surround it a bit; this may take a while...  I always knew, going 
   in, that I was going to have a hard time folding all of this baggage 
   into Sinclair's duffel; survivor of the line, head of B5, missing 24 
   hours, Minbari soul, AND with a connection to the shadows?  It 
   stretched credulity to a tremendous extent.  I figured, once I got 
   into the writing, it would work itself out.  It did so by saying, 
   "Y'know, it'd be a better solution to bring in a new character, and 
   move Sinclair off the chessboard.  It'd let you focus more on Minbar, 
   bring in the Rangers more smoothly, have someone to bounce new info 
   off of for newbies to the show, tie in the Shadows, and allow more 
   conflict and an escalation of the arc."  So I looked at that, and saw 
   that it fillled the areas of the outline that sagged a bit.  Remember, 
   nothing to me is sacred but the telling of the whole story.  Nothing 
   gets in the way of that, including any personal relationships I may 
   have with cast, writers, crew, anybody.  So I went to Michael, and 
   said, "If we do this, I can do a lot more things than I can do now."  
   He liked the idea and there were some things he wanted to do, so we 
   parted company amicably, with the notion that down the road, we might 
   intersect again for some elements of the story.  So parts of the 
   parting were *indicated* or prefaced by the story going in, but I 
   didn't know the *shape* of that resolution until I got there.  ga

.Brendan> 
   OK, thanks! ga

.Scott> 
   Any plans for a map of the galaxy, where the homeworlds are in relation 
   to each other and such?

STRACZYNSKI> 
   We have one, kinda, in the office, for our use, but no plans for a 
   general map.  ga

.Scott> 
   Loved the baseball in "knives"...is football far behind?  Thanks for a 
   great show. ga

.Matt> 
   When will we learn what the Third Age of Mankind is? ga

STRACZYNSKI> 
   Eventually.  ga

.Matt> 
   Hehehe..Well, that's definitely non-specific :)   We've heard rumors 
   that there will be new actors for season 3 - Is that true?  If so, 
   can you give us names?

STRACZYNSKI> 
   Yes, and no names.

.Matt> 
   Ok, thanks...All of us at StMOO (telnet moo.ravenet.com 1701) would 
   also like to say thanks :)

.Karen> 
   I appreciate that B5 mentions God routinely...but Why?

STRACZYNSKI> 
   Karen...why not?  (Stand by, folks, looking for her reply.) ga

.Karen> 
   No, no, I really glad. Your characters have more depth.. and you've put 
   a Jew in space!

STRACZYNSKI> 
   Okay, background here...  I'm an atheist.  My attitude is that we must 
   respect those who wish to believe, and those who choose not to, in 
   equal terms.  Consequently, I must properly respect the notion that 
   in 250 years, religion will still be here and people will still be 
   wrestling with it in many ways...  Bear in mind that, in early history, 
   science and religion emerged as ways of trying to understand the 
   universe around us, using very different methods - faith vs. the 
   scientific method - but the desire and the intent are twin impulses so 
   why not give respect to the idea that some believe?  Hence, I 
   don't keep religion out of my show.  It seems to me that it's the only 
   way to go if I am to be HONEST in how I portray the future, and my 
   characters.  And the first obligation of a writer is to be honest in 
   his writing.  ga

.Karen> 
   Well an atheist who can include an ex-Jessuit and a Jew can't be all 
   bad!

STRACZYNSKI> 
   Absolutely.  I'm just a wonderful human being and a force for good in 
   my time.  Also a snappy dresser.  ga

.Brendan> 
   LOL

.Rich_L>

.Gumby>

   Sorry to keep switching names & numbers, but it's hard to find oneself 
   in v-space...  Since Ellison is 'conceptual consultant,' do you know 
   if he's still as adamant about the terms 'speculative fiction' as 
   opposed to 'sci-fi' as ever?  BTW, thanks for providing hours of work 
   tracking down the multitudes of literary, historical, and cultural 
   references.  ga

STRACZYNSKI> 
   That's m'job.  As for Harlan, yeah, he hates Sci-Fi; says it's the 
   sound of crickets screwing.  ga

.Brendan> 
   LOL again

.Gumby> 
   Definitely ROFL !!

.Rich_L> 
   snorts of disgust.

.John_Drake> 
   Quick followup; any comment on Inonova's possible telepathy?

.Brendan> 
   Oh don't be such a stick in the mud Rich :)

STRACZYNSKI> 
   Who said she had telepathy?  I never said this.  How could I 
   comment on something I've never said?  Such a strange question.  ga

.John_Drake> 
   My wife said she does :)

STRACZYNSKI> 
   I should believe somebody who married YOU?

WARGAMERDAVE> 
   Thanks, have any any TV and/or movie stars asked to be on the show?

STRACZYNSKI> 
   From time to time, yes.  We've had folks come to us, but I'm not 
   sure if it would be correct for me to say who.  ga

WARGAMERDAVE> 
   If for some reason there is no season 3 would you consider doing 
   some theatical movies to tie up the show?

STRACZYNSKI> 
   I can't even consider that possibility. The only way this show has 
   been made is as an act of sheer will.  I decided that it would have a 
   pilot, that we'd get the series order, and we'd go the full run; if I 
   allow myself the slightest doubt on that, it'll never happen.  ga

WARGAMERDAVE> 
   Thank You..

C_HAMER> 
   Is there an earth based outlet for the JS bears? (and B5 soundtrack 
   CD), or do I have to scrape one off the nose of a starfury? GA

STRACZYNSKI> 
   No bear boutiques.  Soundtrack CD is available at any record store 
   now, from Sonic Images.  (The end credits on the show now list the 
   ID # for the soundtrack.) ga

C_HAMER> 
   Followup: What is the count of Amigas in the rendering farm?

STRACZYNSKI> 
   14,287.   How the hells hould I know, they tell me it's faerie dust, 
   and I believe them.  (I think it's actually 10.)

.Brendan> 
   (nearly spewed my coffee there...)

.Gordie> 
   Matthew, I missed you earlier.  You're the host of the B5 Custom Forum, 
   invite the nice folks over, and ask your question.

.Matthew> 
   Ok.. thanks.. :)  The CF is 118, btw.  And my question is when, if at 
   all, will Zathras be making a return appearance?

STRACZYNSKI> 
   Eventually, yes.  What should I do when I get there?  (Can't stay 
   long, either, btw.)  Even though we don't have an order yet for 
   year three, I have to get X-number of scripts ready regardless. ga

.Matthew> 
   Well, I was going to show you around the forum, if you have the time.

STRACZYNSKI> 
   Oh....s'okay, I stopped by yesterday and ran around the place 
   naked.  (You should get a heater in there.)  ga

.Matthew> 
   hehe..

STRACZYNSKI> 
   Check your logons and you'll see my tracks.  (Alas, nobody noticed, 
   except one user who pointed and said, "MY husband has one just like 
   that, but bigger.)

.Brendan> 
   ROFLMAO

.Robert> 
   Ouch, hot tea out the nose!

.Elric> 
   I must say that your team along with Ron Thortons team is a perfect 
   match! Do those guys have time for any other projects?  And thanks 
   for a GREAT SHOW!

STRACZYNSKI> 
   I've developed several other projects, which are in various stages 
   with variuos studios, but haven't pushed too hard since B5 remains 
   my first priority, and I wouldn't be running those shows as a result 
   the same way I run b5.  ga

GRAGEM> 
   Will Sinclair make another appearance before the end of this season?

STRACZYNSKI> 
   Not this season, no.  But as I peek over at my outline, I see a 
   possible two-parter... ga

52RANGER> 
   Opening a jumpgate back to reality...2 quick thankyous JMS...One for 
   B5...One for your WD Book & column work...Keeps me from straying too 
   far :)

STRACZYNSKI> 
   Thanks.

.Gumby> 
   Is Babylon 5 going to released on laser disc any time soon?  This show 
   BEGS to be seen on laser disc !!

STRACZYNSKI> 
   Eventually, yes; but to do so, we would have to re-telecine all of 
   the footage back to its original aspect ratio, then reassemble it all.  
   Which we've discussed, and I've volunteered (at great personal 
   sacrifice) to screen the first set of disks for QC when this happens.  
   But because of the massive work involved, it won't be for a bit 
   yet.  ga

.Gumby> 
   Rats !!

STRACZYNSKI> 
   Mice

.Gumby> 
   <LOL> :)

STRACZYNSKI> 
   Okay, let's see...  How about the narration for year three?  Though 
   I doubt anybody'd be interested in that... Nah, never mind.

.Gordie> 
   Vir?

C_HAMER> 
   please.. go ahead

.Robert> 
   Daffy Duck?

STRACZYNSKI> 
   You sure?

.Brendan> 
   YES!

C_HAMER> 
   Yes...Kosh perhaps?

.Colin> 
   Yes, please!

STRACZYNSKI> 
   Wouldn't want to be a bother.  (Not who, but what's said.)

.Gordie> 
   Bother away!

STRACZYNSKI> 
   Okay, here t'is.

STRACZYNSKI> 
   "The Babylon Project was our last, best hope for peace.  It failed.
   But in the year of the shadow war, it became something greater: our 
   last, best hope...for victory. The year is 2260. The place: Babylon 5."

.Scott> 
   cool

.Rich_L> 
   Oh, damn...

ALLBELL> 
   Victory is not a greater thing than peace.

STRACZYNSKI> 
   Depends on the war.

.Colin> 
   Definite Coolness!

ASCHMUECKER> 
   wow!

GRAGEM> 
   whoa..

.Brendan> 
   You'd think these characters would notice sooner or later that 
   something earth shattering happens every January.. :)

.Gumby> 
   Tres Cool !!

.Karen> 
   YES!

C_HAMER> 
   Please tell me Lando is going to read it again.

STRACZYNSKI> 
   You'll get a hint in the last ep to who reads it.

.Gordie> 
   _Our_ last, best hope...  Ivanova'd be my guess.

.Karen> 
   YES, please

WARGAMERDAVE> 
   gotta be her

STRACZYNSKI> 
   Could be.

.Gumby> 
   Damn straight !!

C_HAMER> 
   Which won't be till October. :(

.Gordie> 
   Could be Keffer, too...

.Brendan> 
   In which ep did the war break out?

STRACZYNSKI> 
   One sorta slides into the other.  As wars do.

STRACZYNSKI> 
   Oh, HR, yours is the last question.  No pressure.  All these folks 
   waiting to see what YOU'RE going to ask.

.High Res> 
   How do you define atheism?

STRACZYNSKI>
                             ...you call that a question?
   All these people, who gave you their chance to ask a question, and 
   THAT'S IT?

.High Res> 
   It fits the standard definition of a question... Yeah!

STRACZYNSKI> 
   Well, yes, gramatically, it does, subject, object, punctuation... 
   Now you want DOCTRINE on atheism?  Hasn't the world got enough 
   problems?

.High Res> 
   Hey, you make us go nuts _every_week_.  I thought I'd see if I could 
   reciprocate. <g>

STRACZYNSKI> 
   I don't believe it.  (There, THAT'S your definition.)

.Gumby> 
   ROFL

.Gordie> 
   Author!  Author!

STRACZYNSKI> 
   (It's true, ANYBODY can get on Delphi.)

.High Res> 
   Very...elusive. <g>

STRACZYNSKI> 
   This is kinda like one of those moments when you go to McDonald's 
   and the guy in the next booth is screaming about that damned Roosevelt.

.Gordie> 
   Well, I want to thank Joe for taking time to spend with us tonight.  
   And all of you out there for joining us.

.Colin> 
   Thanks for the Conference, and most of all, thanks for the show.

STRACZYNSKI> 
   Thanks, everyone, for supporting the program.

.Gordie>
   This CO is officially over!
