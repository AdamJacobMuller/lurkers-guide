<h1>Help build the Guide!</h1>
The <cite>Lurker's Guide</cite> is looking for a few good men (or women) to
help keep things current as the show moves into its second season.
Here's what it needs:

<ul>
<li>
<b>Guide pages</b> for the second half of year one, and beyond.  Matt Ryan
is doing the year-one guide pages right now, but won't be able to continue,
so I need someone to pick up the job.
<li>
<b>Artwork</b> to make things look a little spiffier.
</ul>

<p>
Candidates for the guide-page writing job should:
<ul>
<li>
Have good writing skills.
<li>
Be willing to commit to putting in
the necessary time.  Doing a good guide page will often take several hours.
Ideally you should be able to send in your work within a week or two of an
episode's airing.
<li>
Be able to pick episodes apart.  Matt Ryan's pages
(<a href="guide/000.html">"The Gathering"</a>
through
<a href="guide/007.html">"The War Prayer"</a>
at the moment) are a good example of the level of detail required.
<li>
Stay caught up with the Usenet B5 discussions, which are often a great source
of material.
</ul>
