<h2><a name="BP">Backplot</a></h2>
<ul>
   <li> During the Earth-Minbari War, Captain John Sheridan managed to score
	Earth's only real victory, destroying the Minbari flagship Black Star
	and several cruisers by mining the asteroid belt between Jupiter and
	Mars with fusion bombs.  This earned him the name "Starkiller" among
	the Minbari warrior caste, as well as their continuing hatred.

   <li>	The Minbari population has been slowly declining for two millenia.

   <li>	The Grey Council ordered the end of the war after capturing Sinclair.
	He was the first human to have direct contact with the Council.
	Their original intent was to interrogate him and find out about
	Earth's defenses, but upon scanning him, they found that Minbari
	souls were somehow being reborn in human bodies.  Since Minbari
	religion teaches that all the souls of the Minbari form a greater
	whole, continuing the war would mean, in effect, killing part of
	themselves.  Realizing that the knowledge that this was happening
	to Minbari souls would prove destabilizing to society -- presumably
	some would blame humans for the shrinking population, not to mention
	how the <em>humans</em> would react to the news -- they decided
	to keep their discovery a secret, and protect it with lethal force
	if necessary.

   <li>	After the suicide of the warleader Sineval (cf.
	<a href="017.html">"Legacies"</a>)
	at the end of the war, the crew of his ship, the Trigati, defied the
	surrender order and vanished into exile for nearly twelve years.

   <li>	Before her service on Babylon 5, Ivanova served under Sheridan at the
	transfer point on Io.

</ul>

<h2><a name="UQ">Unanswered Questions</a></h2>
<ul>
   <li>	How did a scan reveal that Minbari souls were being reborn in humans?

   <li>	Will the crew of the Trigati be considered martyrs by the warrior
	caste in spite of their death at Minbari hands?
   
   <li> Why did President Clark already know why the war ended?  (see
	<a href="#JS:clark">jms speaks</a>, and comic
	<a href="/lurk/comic/001.html">"In Darkness Find Me"</a>)

</ul>

<h2><a name="AN">Analysis</a></h2>
<ul>
   <li>	The presence of the unnamed Grey Council member on Babylon 5 implies
	that the Council knew Delenn would disobey its order, and further,
	that they know the purpose of the chrysalis.  In fact, there seems to
	be more division within the Council than they want to admit (cf.
	<a href="020.html">"Babylon Squared"</a>)
	since one of the Councilmembers gave Delenn the triluminary even
	though the council had advised her to wait.

   <li>	Sinclair was the first human to have contact with the Grey Council,
	but there's still ample evidence that that's not the only thing
	unique about him.  Delenn has hinted that she believes he has a great
	destiny (cf.
	<a href="015.html">"Grail"</a>
	and
	<a href="019.html">"A Voice in the Wilderness, part 2"</a>)
	and even in this episode, Lennier says, "A change is coming.
	Sinclair was the first.  There will be others," implying that something
	has happened to him that hasn't yet happened to anyone else.

   <li>	In fact, the Council may have identified a specific Minbari soul in
	Sinclair, perhaps the reincarnation of a great figure in their history;
	that would explain why they're so interested in him in particular.

   <li>	It's possible that the information about Minbari souls isn't even known
	to all of the Grey Council.  When Delenn visited the Council (in
	<a href="020.html">"Babylon Squared"</a>)
	she spoke of the prophecy as the reason for ending the war, and some
	of the other Councilmembers weren't sure that humans were the ones
	the prophecy referred to.  If they had seen whatever scan results
	convinced Delenn that humans had Minbari souls, they presumably would
	have argued with her about those results rather than a vague
	interpretation of the prophecy.

   <li>	The only thing that looked remotely like a scan in Sinclair's
	recollection of his capture on the Line was when one of the Minbari
	held a triluminary up to him.  (cf.
	<a href="008.html">"And the Sky Full of Stars"</a>)
	It's at least plausible that the triluminary was instrumental in
	determining that Sinclair had a reincarnated Minbari soul.  If its
	function is indeed on such a spiritual level, the fact that it was
	part of Delenn's machine (cf.
	<a href="022.html">"Chrysalis"</a>)
	suggests that her transformation may be as much mental as physical.
	This interpretation of the triluminary's function is supported by
	the comic issue
	<a href="/lurk/comic/001.html">"In Darkness Find Me."</a>

   <li> Sheridan's comment that he was the <em>late</em> president's choice
	to replace Sinclair is odd; why would Santiago want someone who would
	be sure to anger the Minbari and increase tensions?

</ul>

<h2><a name="NO">Notes</a></h2>
<ul>

   <li> The Agamemnon was also a ship in the British fleet, at one point
	commanded by Lord Nelson (best known for the Battle of Trafalgar.)

   <li>@@@887274116 Possible factual error: Sheridan said the Dalai Lama ate
	dinner with him, implying an evening meal.  But Buddhist monks,
	including the Dalai Lama, don't eat after noon.  It is, of course,
	possible that Buddhist practices have changed between the twentieth
	and twenty-third centuries, or that "dinner" wasn't meant to imply
	an evening meal, but rather the last meal of the day.

</ul>


<h2><a name="JS">jms speaks</a></h2>
<ul>
   <li> As for Chrysalis, there's about 8 to 10 days in "story time" between
	it and the events in "Points."  The next few shows track in real-time.

<p>
   <li> <i>Why do the Minbari have a grudge against Sheridan?  It was wartime,
	after all.</i><br>
	They don't much like the way he did it, which was rather sneaky.
	My sense is that the Minbari have something of a superiority
	complex; the idea of being beaten, even briefly, by a technically
	inferior race is going to grate on them.  Also, bear in mind, that
	the military caste has not been fully informed about WHY they were
	ordered to surrender...so there's a great deal of animosity just
	barely submerged there, which is pointed at the only real human
	they know from the war...because he cost them.

<p>
   <li> Heads definitely rolled (figuratively speaking) in the Minbari 
	warrior caste after the Black Star incident.  They allowed themselves
	to get cocky, and didn't do a proper job, which was more than an 
	embarrassment to them.

<p>
   <li> It kinda bothered their sense of superiority; also, their sense of 
	honor lies more in the direction of one-to-one combat, rather than 
	mining something as a trap.  Consider it the way British troops did 
	toward American revolutionary fighters who hid behind trees and used 
	guerilla tactics rather than fighting the way the British *wanted* 
	them to fight, out in the open, in nice, easily shot-at rows....

	<p>
   <li> We will be changing the main title sequence after "Revelations"
	airs to include the new version of Delenn.  Would be silly of us to
	include the new version in episodes prior to her unveiling.

	<p>
   <li> The fact that Minbari believe in souls does not make it so.
	<p>
	If a story is rigorously SF, but some of the people who inhabit the
	story have belief systems, does that automatically invalidate it as SF?
 	<p>
	I don't think it's the position of this show to state whether or not
	a belief system is true but rather to explore the actions of those who
	THINK it's true; not to resolve arguments, but to start arguments.  (See
	"Believers" for more on this one.)
 	<p>
	What the characters believe is subjective, and is their business.
	Or, as Sheridan says in a later episode, "I'm not saying what I'm
	saying.  I'm not saying what I'm thinking.  For that matter, I'm not
	even THINKING what I'm thinking."

	<p>
   <li> <a name="JS:clark">This is correct.</a>
	Sheridan did NOT tell President Clark about the
	Minbari soul situation.  Clark already knew about it.  Sheridan's line
	is, "I spoke with the president.  He is the only other person who knows
	why the Minbari surrendered."  Also, in the first issue of the comic,
	this prior knowledge on Clark's part is clear as well.

<p>
   <li> BTW, and just for the heck of it...the line about paying off karma at
	an accellerated rate is something Kathryn has been muttering for ages;
	I popped it into the script for fun. 

<p>
   <li> Sheridan asked what kind of scanners the fighters were using because 
	he couldn't figure out why they were picking up the Minbari fighters. 
	He wanted to be sure nobody had snuck by some kind of new tech.  Once
	he knew they were the same tech as before, he knew something screwy 
	was up.

<p>
   <li> Correct above; Sheridan says, quite specifically, in the conference 
	room with Ivanova after the Grey Council guy is gone, "they used some
	kind of stealth technology WE'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO BREAK."  It's not
	a matter of old or cheaper tech; we just haven't broken their 
	technology yet.

<p>
   <li> And yes, ships can sit in hyperspace (something also mentioned by 
	Laurel Takashima in the pilot, "If I were the Vorlons, I'd have a 
	warship standing by in hyperspace just waiting to attack."

<p>
   <li> Basically, I decided to name the EA Lounge "Earhart's" because she
	is an important figure in aviation history, and I wanted a 40s art 
	deco style to the place, down to big band music, and it fit perfectly.
	There have been more women aviators, civilian and elsewhere, than we 
	know, particularly during WW II at home, and they deserve recognition.

<p>
   <li> The Earthforce lounge (EA personnel only) is Earhart's, named after
	the famed aviator.
	<p>
	(Consequently, as tradition, only swing or big-band music is ever
	played in Earhart's.)
	<p>
	Yes, we brightened things up a notch, but only a notch, because we
	discovered that a lot of the good work being done on the sets and the
	costumes wasn't being seen because we were too dark.  So we went up
	about one f-stop, but at the same time began using more shadows, 
	textures and colors, so the show has a denser look to it.

<p>
   <li> As noted elsewhere...we have previously established that the Dome is
	periodically on Standby Mode, when the system is performing autmoated
	(automated) backups, routine maintenance, that sort of thing.  It was
	in "Midnight," when Garibaldi informs Ivanova that that's where he
	likes to go, when it's on standby, and is quiet.  It was in "Sky," 
	when Ivanova asks Tech 1 if there are any more ships due in for a 
	while, is told no, and she puts her feet up on the console, nobody 
	else around.

	<p>
	Also, B5 tends to run on human cycles of day and night, something we
	try to reflect in the sets and effects, showing the Garden bright 
	during day times, and dark during night stuff (as around dinner time
	in the Fresh Air Restaurant).  Maintaining such cycles has been found
	to be critical in these kinds of environments.

	<p>
	The standby mode only happens every 36-48 hours, for about an hour.
	Most departments also have their own control areas, using C&C mainly
	when command personnel are required.  In addition, there are folks 
	monitoring C&C, and if anything *should* happen, someone could be 
	there within seconds.

<p>
   <li> The Hyperion was built before the EM war, and survived.

	<p>
	The Agamemnon, a much superior ship, was built afterward.  Sheridan 
	was not commanding the Aggy during the war.  It's one of the best 
	ships we've got, almost the equivilent of an aircraft carrier or 
	battleship, and it took a lot of seniority and work to get it.

<p>
   <li> Yes, you will see the Agamemnon again.

<p>
   <li> Nothing has been dumbed down or simplified; in a first season episode
	(in other words, the first episode of any given season), you get a lot
	of sampling.  If the show is obscure, or there's too much prior
	knowledge required to get into it...they go away fast.  So there was a
	bit more straightforward exposition in this episode in order to avoid
	scaring off new viewers.

	<p>
	And I stated, some time ago, that this was a lighter episode because 
	it's sandwiched between two very intense episodes, "Chrysalis" and 
	"Revelations," and I think you need some relief there.

	<p>
	And as Walker noted, there are times when the dome is on standby, as
	noted in "Midnight."  The systems every 36 hours or so go through a 
	period of self-repair and maintainance for an hour or two; if anything
	comes out of the gate or into local space, someone's there within 
	seconds.

<p>
   <li> I wouldn't look for too much of Garibaldi in the first episode; he
	was shot in the back...my feeling is that, TV logic to the contrary,
	it takes TIME to recover from that.  Consequently, this will take a
	few episodes to get even remotely back on track.

<p>
   <li> Yes, the quote definitely comes from Lincoln.  I hated the old 
	Babcom logo, so we dumped it.

<p>
   <li> Re: yankeecentrism...we always strive for balance.  Yes, he quoted
	Lincoln, but he also noted that on his 21st birthday, he flew to see
	the new Dalai Lama being sworn in.

<p>
   <li> Thanks.  If you think PoD was a "wham," then I can't wait to see
	your reaction to "Revelations."

	<p>
	Interestingly enough, I figured on giving Sheridan a tie to the
	Civil War through his ancestor, General Philip Sheridan (sometimes
	called "Little Phil" by Lincoln).  Afterward, I discovered that Bruce
	is a big civil war buff, so the Lincoln stuff worked very well.

	<p>
	One of my favorite sequences from this episode is the stuff aboard
	the Minbari cruiser during the Battle of the Line; the shots 
	surrounding Delenn and the other Minbari gives it a very god-like 
	aspect.  Just wonderful.

<p>
   <li> Yes, Sheridan is descended from Gen. Philip John Sheridan of the
	Union Army.

<p>
   <li> Sheridan is a soldier.  A soldier is told, in wartime, THIS is your
	enemy.  You kill the enemy or your enemy kills you.  Afterward, 
	you're in the same position American soldiers were in after the end
	of WW II when it came time to reconcile with the Germans and the
	Japanese.  It can sometimes be very awkward...and sometimes 
	reconciliation takes a while.

<p>
   <li> For what it's worth, Sheridan is neither a "space cowboy" nor a
	"gung ho type."  This description has nothing to do with the 
	character, and I'm not quite sure where you got this.  Certainly I
	never said or implied it.

	<p>
	Captain John Sheridan is a war hero, of sorts; he squeaked out the
	only real victory of the Earth/Minbari War.  (Which means the Minbari
	don't generally like him a lot.)  He did what he did because that's 
	his job.  He's a professional soldier.  For the last two years, he's
	been commanding the Agamemmnon, a high-visibility Earthforce starship
	on deep patrol.  As such, he has had to learn to work with a number
	of different races and species.

	<p>
	In some ways, his character is somewhat more well-rounded than was
	the case with Sinclair, over whom a general sense of doom often 
	seemed to hang.  Sheridan is often very thoughtful and introspective;
	at other times, he can be just a bit eccentric; he leads by 
	respecting those who work under him, and givingthem room to grow; 
	like any career officer, he HATES the bureaucracy with a passion, and
	this is the one thing that can drive him nuts; he knows that 
	commanding B5 is a great opportunity, but he also knows that his 
	presence brings certain complications with it, and he's very 
	ambivilant about that aspect; he's the son of a diplomatic envoy who
	disappeared on his 21st birthday, running off to see (of all things)
	the new Dali Lama being installed; he has a very easygoing manner, 
	and a great sense of humor.  He quickly re-forms a friendship with
	Ivanova, for whom he has great respect and professional admiration.
	(For a time she served under him at Io.)

	<p>
	He is, actually, a fascinating and intriguing character with a lot
	of different shadings...none of which have *anything* to do with 
	being a "space cowboy" or "gung-ho type."

	<p>
	Anyway...point being...when it was announced that there was going to
	be a new Lieutenant-Commander, a number of folks went ballistic and
	said the show would now be ruined.  I said, in essence, look...I 
	created Takashima; I can create an interesting character to replace 
	her.  And I thunk up Ivanova, who according to the rec.arts.b5 poll 
	is the most popular character on the show.  When it was announced 
	that Sinclair would be STAYING with the show, after the pilot, a 
	number of folks said this was bad, he was wooden, he stunk, get him
	off...and ended up being very enamored of him.  My only reply now 
	about Bruce...give him, and me, a chance.  I genuinely think you will
	like what you see a *lot*.

	<p>
	In the course of the first season, Ivanova, Garibaldi, G'Kar, Londo,
	Delenn, others...they've exploded into strong characters.  You need
	an equally strong character designed to hold his own, and be 
	memorable, in that august company.  Sheridan was designed knowing we
	had a much elevated playing field around the character.

	<p>
	Obviously, clearly, and irrefutably, an actor brings a *lot* to any
	role.  No question.  But it tends to begin with what is created.
	I've seen it said here, repeatedly, that none of the characters are
	uninteresting; they all have lives, and agendas, that make them
	fascinating to watch:  Londo, Morden, G'Kar, Delenn, Garibaldi, 
	Ivanova...what those characters are came out of my head, in terms of
	who tey are, what they say, what they believe, where they came from 
	and where they're going.  Why would I invent a new character that was
	any less involving, or interesting, or multifaceted?  Particularly 
	knowing that he's going to be a central character?

	<p>
	Speaking as someone who's been in fandom a long, long time, I know
	there is always a tendency for panic, to assume the apocalpse is
	upon us, that something is never going to be the same again.  I heard
	this after the Enterprise was destroyed in "The Search for Spock." 
	I've heard this a lot over the years.  It's generally over-reaction 
	and worry before anyone has even seen a frame of film.

	<p>
	Bottom line being...wait and see, then judge.  I've tried very hard
	not to let you down, and I think so far I haven't done so...I have no
	intention of starting now.  Bruce is doing an absolutely *brilliant*
	job as Captain Sheridan, bringing a thoughtfulness and intensity and
	charm and intensity to the part that is a joy to behold.  Give him a
	chance.

<p>
   <li> Alas, I wrote my note about Bruce around 1 or 2 in the morning, and
	I meant to balance out *intensity* with *intelligence*, but my
	brain saw the first letters i-n-t-e, and vapor-locked.

<p>
   <li> <em>How important to the Arc is Sheridan?</em><br>
	How critical was Aragorn to the storyline of Lord of the Rings?

<p>
   <li> The way in which Sheridan comes into the storyline is *absolutely*
	consistent with everything that has come before, and everything that
	follows.

<p>
   <li> Sheridan was never on the original list [to command B5] because at
	that time when the EA needed Minbari financing for B5, they knew it'd
	piss off the Minbari to have it there, so he was never considered for
	the post at that time.

<p>
   <li> "Sounds like a formula to really PO the Minbari."
	<p>
	Yup.

<p>
   <li> Just to clarify: in Soul Hunter we set in place the question of what
	these things are, and do not resolve that question.  Dr. Franklin 
	offers that with the correct technology, it might be possible to
	make (for lack of a better term) a clone of someone's neural patterns,
	copy his personality and memories into a storage device...but also
	dismisses the notion of soul stealing.

	<p>
	I traffic in ambiguity.

<p>
   <li> In a sense, yes, "Believers" now enters the arc...but so does "Soul
	Hunter," in a big way.  Replay Lennier's talk to Sheridan and Ivanova,
	then play Delenn's conversation with Sinclair and the Soul Hunter in 
	that episode, and suddenly a lot of elements begin to intersect.

<p>
   <li> Re: you're noticing the line, "You talk like a Minbari" from Neroon
	to Sinclair in "Legacies"....yup.  Sometimes this stuff is in broad
	strokes, sometimes in teeny little things like that.  Also ties in 
	even further with where Sinclair goes.

<p>
   <li> Note that Lennier says he wishes he could have told them (us) the 
	*rest* of the prophecy...and there's definitely more to Sinclair, as
	will be seen later in the season.  Remember, the Grey Council never 
	tells anyone the whole truth (note how Kalain asks that question
	upon being told that Sinclair is just an ambassador).

<p>
   <li> There really wasn't/isn't time in PoD to get into the angst everyone 
	has over Sinclair leaving (though some of that is given to Sheridan, 
	oddly enough).  But it WILL get brought up in subsequent episodes, 
	especially from Garibaldi.

<p>
   <li> Sinclair was the first human the Minbari (or at least the Grey
	Council) had ever met, having come this far for the final victory.
	The Earth Explorer vessel was part of a military fleet that 
	encountered a Minbari convoy, there was a miscommunication, a 
	misperceived threat, and our ships opened fire.  There was no
	person-to-person contact.

<p>
   <li> Sure, you could blind-fire at a Minbari cruiser, but it's pretty 
	heavily armored.  And while you're shooting at it, you're not only 
	being hit by cruiser blasts, but the several dozen Minbari fighters
	coming in behind you. And shooting at a sublight traveling fighter by
	eye would absolutely never work.  It *has* to be computer guided.

	<p>
	(BTW, for the sharp of eye...if you go back and sill-step through 
	some of the cockpit screen shots in "Sky," you'll note that on the tac
	screen in Sinclair's cockpit it says something to the effect of 
	"Unable to lock-onto target.")

<p>
   <li> Yes, you can go in and shoot at a Minbari *cruiser* visually...but
	the reality is that any long-range weapon will be intercepted by 
	targeting fire, and if you get up real close and personal...well,
	actually, you *can't* get up real close and personal because, as 
	Mitchell learned in "Sky," you get shot by the fighters.

	<p>
	What the fighters tend to remain engaged with are the Minbari fighters,
	which are *incredibly* fast...much too fast to target visually.

	<p>
	And believe me, as Sheridan stated, Earth's been *trying* to break 
	the stealth tech for a while, just hasn't been able to.

<p>
   <li> Re: [Robert] Foxworth...he was someone we spoke to in case Bruce turned out not
	to be available, and we liked him instantly, and he liked the show.  
	So for good luck, we had him come in for this role, which may appear
	again.  He's a terrific actor.

<p>
   <li> <em>What were all those ribbons on General Hague's chest awarded
	for?</em><br>
	I'll have to check, but probably most of those medals are for 
	actions during the Earth/Minbari War, and during the Dilgar War.  
	I'll have to check to get anything more specific than that.

<p>
   <li> Well, my thought at the time, and I probably should've put this
	into dialogue in retrospect, was that there's a window about every 36
	hours when the entire C&C system goes through self-maintainance for
	about half an hour, backing things up, doing self-repair, filing logs
	with Earth Central, that sort of thing.  They normally pick a slow
	period in docking, and any other routine stuff is handled through the
	backup C&C on the other side of the station axis (you can see it
	directly above the docking bay when the normal C&C is directly below 
	it).

	<p>
	At first I'd considered putting that in Ivanova's mouth when she says
	"Of all the time he could've picked," but then the reveal of where
	he was and what he was doing fell flat; it needed to be a surprise or
	it lost its impact and the humor.  Ah, well....

<p>
   <li> It has been established, in prior episodes, that there are brief
	periods when C&C is in "standby mode," during which time no ships are
	due, the station is in "night" cycle, and the operational equipment
	in C&C goes through routine backup and maintenance.  In "Midnight on 
	the Firing Line," our first episode, Ivanova is told by Garibaldi
	that Sinclair is in C&C when it's in standby mode because he likes 
	the quiet during those brief periods (usually only about an hour or
	so); in "Chrysalis," Ivanova asks Tech 1 if any more ships are due in
	for a while, is told no, and she puts her feet up on the console,
	watching the news, with the place pretty much deserted.

	<p>
	This isn't the bridge of a starship; this is mainly a center of
	operations for docking and other station activities requiring command
	personnel.  Every separate department -- environmental, other 
	resources -- has its own separate control center, with lots of
	redundency.

	<p>
	In addition, there's always somebody monitoring stuff as it comes    
	through, so if there *were* any kind of problem, there'd be somebody 
	on site in C&C in thirty seconds.  Basically, we're talking an hour
	or so once every 36 to 48 hours.  I could've explained this in 
	dialogue, but it would've taken the edge off the revelation and humor,
	and I figured we'd done this before enough times that it wouldn't be
	an issue.

<p>
   <li> Just as an advisory...the woman who spoke up in PoD (the tech who
	told Sheridan that Security wanted him) is not a Tech 1 replacement;
	she was there just for that one episode.  We have a number of folks
	floating through that area now, because logically you would have 
	rotating crews.

<p>
   <li> A vibe shower would theoretically use sonic waves (in combination 
	with other elements, like disinfecting lighting, as seen in "Signs")
	to remove dirt and kill bacteria.

	<p>
	That's my story and I'm sticking to it.

<p>
   <li> Delenn staying while Sinclair goes is part of WHY Sinclair goes and
	Delenn stays.  It's absolutely part and parcel.

<p>
   <li>@@@834423619 Delenn had intended to tell Sinclair much about the soul issue
	before entering the chrysalis.

<p>
   <li> It's always interesting, if you have one character upon whom everyone
	else leans, even depends, to *remove* that character for a time.  
	Because then those characters have to *react*...to either stand or 
	fall on their own.  It shakes things up a little...and vastly 
	intensifies the characters.

<p>
   <li> I'm going to test myself, and see how much I can say without saying 
	too much.

	<p>
	You have X-number of characters.  They're all in the same place.  
	You're trying to tell a story that has a great deal of scale, and 
	covers all kinds of worlds, changing politics, alliances, on and on. 
	The question becomes, how do you *illustrate* that?  To use a line
	from the original Trek, when a mob guy is brought aboard the
	Enterprise, he says later, "All I saw was a room and five guys."

	<p>
	So now you start saying, "Hmmm...what if I remove Character A from 
	the chessboard, and move him over *here* for a while?  He wasn't going
	to be doing much for the next little bit anyway.  And we won't just
	"deal" with that change, it's part of the story...it broadens out the
	story to include Place A *and* Place B.  It has repercussions down the
	road.  It comes up again in the future.  Elements from Place B now
	become known on Place A.  Character A may even make an occasional
	reappearance to keep us even more closely connected with Place B, 
	which is necessary because Place B is very, very important."

	<p>
	What we have in mind here isn't quite comparable to anything that's
	been done before.  The character will still be alive.  The character 
	will continue to have an impact on the story.  The character will be
	spotted from time to time.  The character will continue to show up in
	the comic and the novels.  And through this move, you have the benefit
	of substantially opening up the B5 universe, you help create the 
	realignment of characters and loyalties that was anticipated for this
	season, and it helps kick over the tables, as we did in Chrysalis.

	<p>
	Just a slight refinement on the argument.

<p>
   <li> I can probably answer your question a little better after you've seen
	the second episode of this season.  For now, let's just say this: in
	working out the story for year two, Sinclair's main line of connection
	was to the Minbari.  But the Minbari storyline was diminishing in ways
	onnected to the war in year two; obviously we all know what is on the 
	upswing in year two, certain dark forces.  I needed someone who has a 
	connection to *that* side of the story to personalize it, and Sheridan
	brings that connection to the mix, although he doesn't know it yet.

<p>
   <li> The Battle of the Line and the hole in Sinclair's mind was always
	intended as the entry point or trigger to the story.  It's like Frodo
	being given the Ring in LoTR.  The story isn't about that, that's how
	we get INTO it.  Frankly, there's no way you can sustain that one 
	element for five years, nor did we ever intend to do so.
	<p>
	The only difference in the resolution of that aspect is this: we had
	originally intended to resolve the missing 24 hours, and the Battle 
	of the Line, by episode four, season two.  We've simply moved it up 
	3 eps to the first episode.  Because new players are coming onto the
	field, in the form of the Shadowmen, and other forces, and we now 
	have to begin turning our attention to new mysteries.

<p>
   <li> "Changes are coming; Sinclair was the first, there will be others."
	He was referring to more changes coming.

<p>
   <li> Sheridan, or more specifically the need for someone *like* Sheridan
	began to get through clearly toward the latter part of last season, 
	as I began planning out season two's progression, and kept looking at
	elements of the story and trying to find ways to get Sinclair into 
	the heart of them.  They felt contrived, for the most part; and the 
	other characters, like Londo and G'Kar and Delenn, were *really* 
	moving forward in a big way.  The role of Sinclair was becoming 
	primarily that of a "problem solver," and when that happens, a sort
	of glass bell falls down around the character, and you can't do much
	with him.
	<p>
	So what the writer has to do is break that bell in one way or 
	another; do something totally unexpected to him, and bring in someone
	who has a direct, personal connection with the storyline emerging in
	season two, so it's not contrived or forced.

<p>
   <li>@@@859396941 All the characters are unique; there seems to be this
	bone-headed notion, that  I frequently run into, of "Well,
	Ivanova's just Takashima renamed," or "Sheridan's  story is
	just the same as Sinclair's, same guy just renamed."  They're
	*not* and  never have been.  The story of one does not devlove
	automatically upon the  other.  If you make a change, it's
	because you have something better in  mind...otherwise why
	make it?

<p>
   <li> I said, from the very beginning, that once the series got rolling, no
	single primary question could be allowed to go more than about one 
	season before answering it, otherwise you get into a frustrating Twin
	Peaks situation where *nothing* is resolved.  Basically, the events
	begun in "Chrysalis" bleed over into three episodes; the Battle of the
	Line answers were initially only a couple of episodes further down in 
	my outline, about episode #3.  Making the change, for one thing,
	allowed me to move that storyline forward to episode #1, blow through
	it and get the story moving in year two faster, rather than delaying 
	further with loose threads from season one.

<p>
   <li> The idea of a Chrysalis II went by the boards once I really got into
	the script, and realized that C1 had tipped over too many tables to 
	even HOPE to resolve them in one follow-up episode.  So the threads
	yanked in C1 will be paid off over several episodes, hence no C2; the
	first episode of year two is "Points of Departure."

<p>
   <li> <em>What about Catherine Sakai?</em>
	<p>
	This is the one thread that I'm still trying to decide about.

<p>
   <li>@@@834859258 They didn't get married.  Wasn't time, and his new posting
	precluded that.

<p>
   <li> We're dedicated to improving all of these elements on a regular basis;
	CGI, sets, directing, lighting, name it.
	<p>
	The music will change every year, to get in sync with where the season 
	is going; the tone and tenor and mood will shift.
	<p>
	Re: the narration...last year, Michael had the benefit of being able to
	see the sequence prior to reading the narration, and reading with the 
	images.  That was when we were shooting in July to air in January.  In
	this case, shooting in August to air in November, Bruce had to wing it,
	without any images for reference, just text.  Now that we've got the
	opening completed (and we weren't satisfied with it or done tinkering
	with it until a few days before delivery), we'll probably let him do 
	it again with the visuals before him, so he knows what he's reading to,
	since it'll have a *big* impact on how he delivers the stuff.

<p>
   <li> There's a reason for this: due to time constraints, we have to get 
	Bruce to do the narration *without* having the images in front of him;
	he had no way of knowing where beats would go with the images, or what
	would be under it (since we were still putting the new opening 
	together), so we had to artifically build in pauses when we did the 
	final transfer (as opposed to year one, where we had the images
	assembled long before we had Michael do the narration).  What took 
	forever was that 5 fade/dissolve/wipe, which just killed us time-wise,
	but is spiffy to look at.
	<p>
	Now that it's all together, we plan to have Bruce re-do the narration
	with the images in front of him, so he can respond naturally and make
	it flow, the way he would've been able to do had we had the material 
	ready in time.

<p>
   <li> Re: the theme music...to me, one is neither worse nor better than the
	other.  They're *different*, and meant to convey different moods and 
	themes.  Each year it'll change.  This year was heavy on strings and 
	brass; next year it'll be heavy on percussion.  The main theme will be
	reinterpreted and interpolated in different ways.  In the B5 universe,
	change is the only constant.

<p>
   <li> Promoting Ivanova to running the station would not be logical, since
	from a military and diplomatic standpoint she has nowhere *near* the
	level of experience required.  It wouldn't be done in real life.

</ul>
