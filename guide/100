<h2><a name="BP">Plot Points</a></h2>
<ul>

   <li>@@@892086202 Garibaldi's drinking has begun to seriously impair his
	ability to do his job, and although he seems to realize he has a
	problem, he has so far refused to mention it to anyone.

   <li>@@@892086202 While G'Kar was with Londo on Centauri Prime, some Narn
	broke into his quarters and stole his book.  It has, in under a month,
	gained great popularity, and may soon outsell the Book of G'Quon.  As
	a result, many Narn now consider G'Kar a holy figure, and are gathering
	on Babylon 5 to hear him speak.

   <li>@@@892086202 Franklin has been offered a position in Earthdome, as
	head of xenobiological research.  The position is currently held by
	Dr. Benjamin Kyle
	(<a href="000.html">"The Gathering"</a>)
	but Kyle intends to step down at the end of the year.  Franklin will
	use the position to continue his research on cross-species diseases
	(<a href="094.html">"Strange Relations."</a>)

   <li>@@@892089227 Although Alliance member worlds are officially obliged
	to boycott certain products (dust and some other drugs, certain
	biological weapons, etc.) many of them simply use smugglers to
	trade in forbidden goods unofficially.

</ul>

<h2><a name="UQ">Unanswered Questions</a></h2>
<ul>

   <li>@@@892086202 Who was the Drazi who attacked Garibaldi's friend?

   <li>@@@892089630 Did G'Kar get the original copy of his book back?  Will
	he continue to work on it, or was it finished?

</ul>

<h2><a name="AN">Analysis</a></h2>
<ul>

   <li>@@@892086202 Although the conclusion was correct, Garibaldi's evidence
	that the Centauri are involved in the attacks on Alliance ships wasn't
	very solid.  Londo appeared to believe that buttons from palace guards
	weren't particularly hard to come by; given that the parties behind
	the attacks had planted evidence before, an item pointing to the
	Centauri could have been just another attempt at misdirection.

</ul>

<h2><a name="NO">Notes</a></h2>
<ul>

   <li>@@@892086202 G'Kar started writing his book in B5's brig in
	<a href="052.html">"Messages from Earth."</a>

   <li>@@@892086202 Garibaldi drinks "Afterburner" brand whiskey.

   <li>@@@892086202 It hurts more to punch Drazi than other races.

   <li>@@@892086202 Drazi are vulnerable to motion sickness.

   <li>@@@892086202 The streets of Drazi cities are all extremely narrow,
	an architectural holdover from pre-flight times intended to make it
	harder for invading armies to maneuver.

   <li>@@@892086202 Drazi homes tend to have large open patio areas,
	since Drazi are traditionally an outdoor race.

</ul>

   <li>@@@890333453 Each season we have increased the amount of CGI we've done,
	both in the amount and the complexity of the shots, and this season is
	no exception.  We're trying some new things, different kinds of
	CGI...you'll see some of that in "The Ragged Edge," for instance.  Much
	more sophisticated compositing, more difficult to shoot, but more
	visually interesting.

<p>
   <li>@@@892532194 <em>Now that Londo is back, why doesn't Sheridan warn
	him about what he saw in
	<a href="061.html">"War Without End?"</a></em><br>
	This comes from not separating out what we the viewers know, from what
	the characters know.  

	<p>
	What Sheridan knows is that 17 years from now, Londo had something on
	his shoulder called a Keeper, which may or may not have a direct
	connection with the apparent attack on Centauri Prime by Shadow allies.

	<p>
	What he doesn't know is, did this happen 16 years ago?  Or six months
	ago? What process led it to happen?  What should he be warning Londo
	*about*?  He saw the result...but what process, what event should he
	warn Londo about to avoid this?  He doesn't know that the Regent has a
	keeper, the Regent could be acting in these ways for his own reasons
	entirely.

	<p>
	Further, there's a certain trickiness about time stuff.  Okay, so he
	warns Londo about something he doesn't really understand...does he now
	change the future?  Does he have someone else other than Londo now on
	the throne, who won't spare his and Delenn's lives?  

	<p>
	There are too many variables, and not enough actually known by him, to
	say anything that would be of any use to anyone.

</ul>
