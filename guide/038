<h2><a name="BP">Backplot</a></h2>

<ul>

   <li> Delenn and Kosh tell Sheridan about the Shadows and the Vorlons:<br>

	<dl compact>
	<dt><b>D:</b>
	<dd>
	There are beings in the universe billions of years older than either of
	our races.  Once, long ago, they walked among the stars like giants.
	Vast, timeless... they taught the younger races, explored beyond the
	Rim, created great empires.  But to all things, there is an end.
	Slowly, over a million years, the First Ones went away.  Some passed
	beyond the stars, never to return.  Some simply disappeared.

	<dt><b>S:</b>
	<dd>
	I'm sure this is all very interesting, but what does any of this
	have to do with Morden?

	<dt><b>D:</b>
	<dd>
	Not all of the First Ones have gone away.  A few stayed behind.  Hidden
	or asleep, waiting for the day when they may be needed.  When the
	Shadows come again.

	<dt><b>S:</b>
	<dd>
	Shadows?

	<dt><b>D:</b>
	<dd>
	We have no other name for them.  The Shadows were old when even the
	ancients were young.  They battled one another over and over across a
	million years.  The last Great War against the Shadows was ten thousand
	years ago.  It was the last time the ancients walked openly among us.
	The Shadows were only defeated, not destroyed.  A thousand years ago,
	the Shadows returned to their places of power, rebuilt them, and began
	to stretch forth their hand.  Before they could strike, they were
	defeated by an alliance of worlds, including the Minbari and the few
	remaining First Ones who had not yet passed beyond the veil.  When
	they had finished, the First Ones went away.  All but one.

	<dt><b>S:</b>
	<dd>
	There's still one of them left.  Where?

	<dt><b>D:</b>
	<dd>
	(indicates Kosh, to Sheridan's great surprise) That is why Kosh cannot
	leave his encounter suit.  He would be recognized.

	<dt><b>S:</b>
	<dd>
	Recognized?  By who?

	<dt><b>K:</b>
	<dd>
	Everyone.

	<dt><b>D:</b>
	<dd>
	For centuries the Vorlons stood alone, the last remaining guardians.
	Watching and waiting.

	</dl>

<p>
   <li> Delenn's question to Kosh (cf.
	<a href="022.html">"Chrysalis"</a>)
	was, "Have the Shadows returned to Z'ha'dum?"

<p>
   <li> The Icarus, an Earth exploration vessel carrying Anna Sheridan, arrived
	at Z'ha'dum in late 2256 (see
	<a href="#AN:dates">Analysis.</a>)
	A landing party, exploring a cave, inadvertently
	discovered the Shadows, awakening them.  The Shadows destroyed the
	Icarus so its crew could not return to warn others, and killed the
	crewmembers who wouldn't cooperate.  Morden was one of the crew.

<p>
   <li> Delenn and Kosh knew about the reawakening of the Shadows immediately --
	maybe even witnessed it somehow as it was happening.

<p>
   <li> The Earth government has formed a new agency, the Ministry of Peace
	(nicknamed "Minipax" by its employees,) with the alleged goal of
	helping reduce internal tensions among the EA's populace.  Its first
	visible action was to establish a program called the Night Watch,
	paying people 50 credits a week to wear black armbands and report
	suspicious people to the authorities so that troublemakers can be
	reformed before they disrupt the peace.

</ul>

<h2><a name="UQ">Unanswered Questions</a></h2>

<ul>

   <li> Is Sheridan's wife still alive?

   <li> What is the Ministry of Peace really up to?

   <li> Will Talia join?

   <li> Similarly, what significance is there in the fact that Delenn narrated
	Sheridan's vision?  Was she sharing it with him, or had she seen it
	before?

   <li> What kind of information did Morden bring for Londo?

   <li> What, if anything, happened to the ship that originally discovered
	the ruins on Z'ha'dum?  Someone must have discovered them before the
	Icarus' arrival, since the crew of the Icarus knew they were going
	to explore an ancient civilization.

</ul>

<h2><a name="AN">Analysis</a></h2>

<ul>

   <li> Delenn's opening remarks about the First Ones bear a striking similarity
	to G'Kar's comments about the beings at Sigma 957 (cf.
	<a href="006.html">"Mind War."</a>)
	Could those beings also be First Ones?  If so, are the Vorlons aware
	that they are still around in some form?

   <li> Her remarks also echo her comments about humans in
	<a href="020.html">"Babylon Squared"</a>
	-- suggesting that she believes humanity has the capacity to eventually
	rival the First Ones.

   <li> Delenn stated that all but one of the First Ones have gone away, and
	that the last one is Kosh.  But does she mean that only one race
	remains, or only one individual?  Or is there a difference where
	Vorlons are concerned?  (See
	<a href="#JS:vorlons">jms speaks</a>)

   <li> If Kosh would be recognized by "everyone" because (as implied by Delenn)
	his race had once walked openly among lesser ones, it's plausible that
	Kosh may resemble something from legends thousands of years old -- an
	angel, perhaps, since the Shadows bear some resemblance to demons and
	Kosh's suit seems to have room for wings.  This would tie in with
	Kosh's statement in
	<a href="035.html">"Hunter, Prey"</a>
	that Sheridan must be ready "to fight legends" before Kosh will reveal
	himself -- otherwise he'd be mistaken by some as a divine being rather
	than an alien.  Of course, angels and demons are far from the only
	figures in the human pantheon, let alone alien mythology, and Kosh
	may be something else entirely.

   <li> Or the encounter suit may allow Kosh to control who gets visions like
	Sheridan's; if he took it off, everyone who tried to look at him would
	see something different, something personal.  (See
	<a href="#JS:hand">jms speaks.</a>)
	This brings up a potential connection to the flashes in
	<a href="020.html">"Babylon Squared"</a>;
	perhaps the Vorlons were involved in Babylon 4's time travel, and
	the flashes were a side effect of that.

   <li> Why did Delenn demand to see Kosh in
	<a href="022.html">"Chrysalis"</a>
	before she was willing to undergo her change?  She seems to know enough
	about Vorlons that she would have had some idea what he looked like.
	Did she simply want to verify that Kosh was one of the First Ones
	mentioned in the Minbari history books?  Or does his appearance have
	something more directly to do with her wanting to become partially
	human?  That's assuming he was showing himself to her at all, rather
	than sending her a dream sequence.

   <li> How did Kosh know what happened on Z'ha'dum?  Or was he just inventing
	the scene he showed Sheridan based on what he figured must have
	happened?  Perhaps he gleaned it from his meeting with Morden in
	<a href="013.html">"Signs and Portents,"</a>
	though Delenn claims she and Kosh have known about it for the past
	three years.

   <li> <a name="AN:dates">The Icarus expedition</a>
	seems to have set forth in late 2256.  In
	<a href="024.html">"Revelations,"</a>
	which is set in early 2259, Sheridan's sister says that it's been
	two years since Anna's death.  In this episode, Delenn implies that
	the Shadows were awakened three years earlier.  Late 2256 makes sense
	if both of them were rounding.

   <li> The Shadows on Z'ha'dum may have been awakened in 2256,
	but they weren't the first.  The creature in
	<a href="027.html">"The Long Dark"</a>
	awoke during the Earth-Minbari War and was headed for Z'ha'dum.
	What caused it to wake up before its masters did, assuming its
	masters are the beings the Icarus discovered?

   <li> Delenn's question was, "Have the Shadows <em>returned</em> to
	Z'ha'dum?"  That implies they were elsewhere; if so, where?  Perhaps
	the same thing that drew the abovementioned creature to Z'ha'dum
	also drew the Shadows there.  In that case, they may have already
	been awake before the Icarus arrived.

   <li> Sheridan let Morden go so he wouldn't suspect that his true nature
	is known.  But the damage may already be done; Morden and his
	associates are likely to be suspicious of his sudden release.
	The reason given to Morden -- "it was all a mistake" -- is going to
	seem especially suspicious; "the Centauri asked for your release"
	or "you're right; we can't hold you without charges" seem like they
	would have been better excuses.  Of course, the latter may be what
	Zack told Morden.

   <li> The Night Watch armbands seem more a tool of terror than of peace,
	reminiscent of the armbands worn by Nazis and other tyrannical
	regimes, a constant reminder to everyone that they're under
	observation.  The program seems designed to cause people to turn in
	their neighbors, and it's probably naive to believe that people
	accused of suspicious behavior (or worse, suspicious "attitudes")
	will simply be put into therapy and
	released shortly thereafter.  Combined with the Ministry of Public
	Morale (cf.
	<a href="037.html">"And Now For a Word"</a>)
	it suggests the Clark government is more interested in keeping the
	citizenry under its thumb than anything noble.

   <li> If it's true that the Night Watch considers thoughts dangerous, they
	may well be involved with Psi Corps somehow; certainly it would make
	sense for them to try to involve telepaths in rooting out undesirables.
	Or, perhaps more likely, they're simply another of Psi Corps'
	machinations.

   <li> The Shadows aren't the only ones inhabiting places of power.  Londo
	observed that the technomages (cf.
	<a href="025.html">"The Geometry of Shadows"</a>)
	were usually cloistered in their places of power.  And now the
	technomages are headed for the Rim, or beyond it, because of a great
	darkness approaching; what do they hope to achieve?

   <li> Unless the holding cell cameras are very advanced, the Shadows'
	invisibility is not all that good.  Presumably there are aliens on the
	station who can see well into the infrared or ultraviolet; the Shadows
	would be easily detected by such beings in any public area.  Perhaps
	that's how Kosh knew who Morden was in
	<a href="013.html">"Signs and Portents."</a>
	On the other hand, it may simply be that some aliens <em>have</em>
	seen the Shadows with Morden, but didn't think them remarkable enough
	to be worth mentioning; they're probably far from the weirdest-looking
	creatures walking around the station.

   <li> Talia was able to detect the Shadows without even trying.  That suggests
	that telepaths will be a valuable weapon against the Shadows -- which
	leads to the suspicion that the Shadows are working to co-opt Psi-Corps
	behind the scenes so human telepaths will be less likely to work
	against them.  It's not clear whether her ability to sense the Shadows
	was typical for a P5 telepath, or a result of her enhanced abilities
	(cf. <a href="006.html">"Mind War."</a>)

   <li> It's also worth noting that Talia saw Morden darken the same way Delenn
	did in
	<a href="013.html">"Signs and Portents"</a>
	-- does this mean Delenn has some telepathic ability?

   <li> In
	<a href="004.html">"Infection,"</a>
	Franklin says the Ikarans built their war machines to fend off
	invasions, the last of which was 1000 years ago.  Could they have been
	participants in the last conflict with the Shadows?  Will the
	technology obtained by Earth in that episode be used in the upcoming
	war?

   <li> Morden's triangular hand placement while he was in his cell is
	reminiscent of Lennier's meditation posture.  Perhaps there's no
	connection, or perhaps there is.

</ul>

<h2><a name="NO">Notes</a></h2>

<ul>

   <li> The name "Ministry of Peace" and its abbreviation Minipax are from
	George Orwell's "1984."

   <li> The convention mentioned by Talia is probably not the one described
	in the novel
	<a href="/lurk/novels/001.html">"Voices"</a>
	because the novel takes place before
	<a href="031.html">"The Coming of Shadows."</a>

   <li> Delenn's narrative bears some resemblance to Gandalf's description of
	the coming of Sauron near the beginning of the first book of "The Lord
	of the Rings."  In particular, this passage:

	<blockquote>
	"The rumours that you have heard are true: he has indeed arisen again
	and left his hold in Mirkwood and returned to his ancient fastness in
	the Dark Tower of Mordor.  That name even you hobbits have heard of,
	like a shadow on the borders of old stories.  Always after a defeat
	and a respite, the Shadow takes another shape and grows again."
	</blockquote>

</ul>

<h2><a name="JS">jms speaks</a></h2>
<ul>

   <li> <a name="JS:about">"In the Shadow of Z'ha'dum"</a> is an
	episode that is as emotionally raw as
	<a href="022.html">"Chrysalis"</a>
	with some major
	revelations that force Sheridan to make the most important decision
	of his life.

<p>
   <li> Correct; Delenn and Kosh have said nothing about G'Kar's claims
	because they're trying to keep a low profile.

<p>
   <li> The shadows know that Kosh knows, because the Vorlons *always* know;
	they also know (or think) that they're in a superior position because
	if Kosh should tell the others, either a) most wouldn't believe him, 
	or b) the shadows would move aggressively now, costing untold lives.
	They're more worried about an alliance between lots of races than the
	Vorlons alone.

<p>
   <li> I would not create a race as potentially unstoppable as the 
	shadows without making sure they had one -- but only one -- Achilles'
	heel.  Though it may take our characters a long time to figure out what
	that is...almost *too* long....

<p>
   <li> <a name="JS:vorlons">No, "all but one" refers to the race,</a>
	not an individual.  The First
	Ones are various species/races.  One of these species/races is still
	around at this time.  The Vorlons.  Of which Kosh is one.

<p>
   <li>@@@882988098 BTW, the one big reason that Sakai [Catherine, Sinclair's
	old flame in the first season] could not have filled Anna Sheridan's
	role in awakening the shadows...and this is the one thing that everyone
	who advocates this theory tends to forget...is that they were *already
	up and awake* in the first season, as we saw in "Signs and Portents." 
	They were up, around, and had had some time to build stuff up, reclaim
	some of their ships, and in other ways get organized and develop their
	contacts.  

	<p>
	Also, Morden was already working for them.

<p>
   <li>@@@838583849 <em>Why did Delenn demand to see Kosh?</em><br>
	She wanted to see Kosh to assure herself that the Vorlons, who
	she'd never met before, were who she believed them to be, and that this
	was a true Vorlon and not a pretender.  He had to be in place as part
	of Valen's prophecy.

<p>
   <li> The rim, and the "veil" beyond which the bulk of the First Ones
	passed, is the Galactic rim.  As for why the shadows are doing what
	they're doing...that's kind of the key to the whole thing, which we
	haven't turned yet.

<p>
   <li>@@@839189753 Some of the first ones just got bored after millions of years,
	and went off in general.  The rest, for the most part, went beyond the
	Rim for the same reason you cut down old trees to make room for new
	ones.

<p>
   <li> <em>Are the First Ones as old as the universe itself?</em><br>
	Well, to some degree you're limited by the amount of time it
	takes to evolve life per se, then into intelligent life, then into
	spacefaring life. You need time after the Big Bang for planets to be
	formed, cool, develop environments capable of supporting life...then
	the long haul begins.

	<p>
	So yes, on the one hand, you've got races that are millions of
	years older than humans, who were prowling around while we were still
	furred, fanged, and slamming bones together.  But they're not as old as
	the universe, because they can't be.

<p>
   <li> Exploration and archeological/scientific vessels like this usually
	piggy-back on Explorer or other jump-capable ships, with an arrangement
	that they'll be there for X-number of days or weeks, then another ship
	will come that way and again piggy-back them out.

<p>
   <li> Thanks.  I like Vir a lot.  Many folks were willing to write him off
	in the beginning, not understanding that there was more beneath the
	surface (a problem Vir has also had in his "life").  But you gotta be
	careful; characters have a way of surprising you.  And I like that, and
	intended that, Vir be the first one to stand up to Morden.

<p>
   <li> Again, look at the Kosh/Morden scene in
	<a href="013.html">"Signs."</a>
	A light is suddenly blown out off to one side.  Morden didn't move.
	So who did it...but his constant companions?

<p>
   <li> <em>Kosh's command to Morden in "Signs"</em><br>
	His comment would have been addressed to the shadows and their current
	emissary.

<p>
   <li>@@@839120486 <em>How does Morden communicate with the Shadows so
	easily?</em><br>
	Well, one can always assume that Morden received some help, in one form
	or another, in adjusting to the shadows....

<p>
   <li> The difference is just in accent.  ZA HA DOOM is the way I pronounce
	it, but ZA cHA DOOM is also acceptable (from someone who's learned to
	more or less accept the 47 different ways in which one may pronounce
	straczynski).

<p>
   <li> And, as you note, one of things that I like to play with is the 
	layering of ambiguity.  Let's say, just for the sake of argument, that 
	we set up two sides: Shadowmen vs. Vorlons, which looks like evil vs. 
	good.  Fundamentally, I would find that boring.  What you would then 
	have to do is get into WHY they're doing what they do, and HOW they're 
	doing what they do.

	<p>
	There is, for instance, the "good" that says, "We know what's best 
	for you, we'll protect you, nurture you, but you'll do it our way, and 
	we'll keep you away from ideas and beliefs you shouldn't be exposed
	to." Okay, maybe that fits one definition of good...but is it?

	<p>
	On the flip side, for instance, there's the "bad" that says "There 
	must be conflict and death, because it's only through conflict and
	death that we grow stronger, that we can eventually create an ordered
	universe.  The gene pool must be kept strong.  To do that, there must
	be war and strife and death."  Okay, maybe that fits the definition
	of evil, but is it?

	<p>
	The key, again and always, is that nothing is what it seems on 
	Babylon 5.  And even if it looks like it IS what it is, you have to 
	look at WHY it is what it is...and maybe at that point it isn't.

	<p>
	One of the things about this show is that you see as much as 
	you're willing to see.  You can gloss over it, say, "Okay, these are 
	the good guys, these are the bad guys."  But the closer you look, the 
	more you see the shades.  I imagine when the Shadowmen are more fully 
	revealed, some folks'll think we're going for a basic good/evil 
	conflict...but believe me, there's a hell of a lot more involved in 
	it than that.

<p>
   <li> <a name="JS:hand"><em>(From a 1993 GEnie message -- presumably we can
	replace "Sinclair" with "Sheridan" now.)</em></a>

	<p>
	I've just sat here for five minutes trying to decide how to phrase this
	and not give something vital away...and it's damn near impossible.

	<p>
	(another five minutes passes)

	<p>
	Okay, look...do this.  Get a piece of paper.  Write down the following:
	"Sinclair sees the hand, but Sinclair does not see the hand.   And
	five other people standing in the room would not see the hand that
	Sinclair sees, or see the hand that they see."

	<p>
	I know it looks like gibberish.  But trust me on this.  Put the piece of
	paper in your wallet (next to the condom) and hold onto it for about two
	years.  Assuming we're still around that long, at some point that
	message will make absolute and perfect sense.

<p>
   <li> Kosh is always and forever *exactly* what he appears to be, no less and
	no more.  At the same time, Kosh is absolutely *nothing* like what he
	appears to be.

	<p>
	These are not contradictory statements.

	<p>
	And this is about the straightest answer I've given yet on the subject,
	believe it or not.

<p>
   <li> I think it would be just about impossible to put Kosh on the outside
	of a mug.

<p>
   <li> Exactly.  You will note that Macabee says, of the Ministry, "...or
	Minipax, as we like to call it around the office."  It's an in-house
	joke, not the real name of the thing.

<p>
   <li> Re: the two speeches by G'Kar and Delenn...yes, they were constructed
	specifically to echo one another, because the walkers at Sigma 957 are
	one of the older races that flit through but don't really pay any
	attention to us anymore.

<p>
   <li>@@@846703990 The Vorlons are one of the remaining ancient races;
	Kosh is one of the Vorlons, not the last of them.

<p>
   <li> Kosh is a Vorlon.  The Vorlons fought the Shadows.  There are many 
	Vorlons, back home.  (The Writer committed an error in that he used 
	too many pronouns in that segment of dialogue.)

<p>
   <li> <em>Was Kosh's line about Sheridan going to Z'ha'dum a warning or a
	threat?</em><br>
	Yes.

<p>
   <li> How do you get a shot of Morden's head on a pike past the censors?
	<p>
	Easy.
	<p>
	You frame the shot so the head is draped...in shadows.
	<p>
	If I were to be planning such a thing, of course....

<p>
   <li> MPs (Military Police) also wear armbands.  So do the Red Cross and some
	United Nations forces.  

<p>
   <li> <em>How many times did you shoot the scene with Talia slapping
	Sheridan?</em><br>
	Only twice.  Mainly 'cause she tended to whack him real hard.
	[...]
	The take you see is the first one printed.

<p>
   <li> He said stop because Zack had found the right wavelength (at least
	briefly) and didn't want him to go further and lose it again.

<p>
   <li> <em>Will Vir, even metaphorically, get to wave at Morden?</em><br>
	That would be telling.

<p>
   <li> <em>Was the Great Machine inside Epsilon 3 built by a member race of the
	First Ones?</em><br>
	Could be.

<p>
   <li> No, Varn was not one of the First Ones.

   <li> <em>Bruce: what has the most challenging episode been for you so
	far, and why?</em><br>
	The episode we just finished filming today.
	It's called In the Shadow of Za'Ha'Dum and my character deals with
