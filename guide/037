<h2><a name="BP">Backplot</a></h2>

<ul>

   <li> The Narn homeworld was invaded by the Centauri around 2110.  The
	occupation lasted for approximately 100 years.

   <li> G'Kar joined the resistance after his father was executed by the
	Centauri.

   <li> 41% of Earth Alliance citizens feel that Babylon 5 isn't worth the
	time and expense.

   <li> The Centauri have been using the space around the station as a
	transfer point for weapons for the war effort.

   <li> Over 250,000 humans died during the Earth-Minbari War.

   <li> Back on Earth, the Clark government has formed the Office of Public
	Information and the Ministry for Public Morale -- both very Orwellian
	names.  (see
	<a href="#JS:gov">jms speaks</a>)

   <li> Senator Hidoshi, Sinclair's main Senate contact in season one, is no
	longer in office.

   <li> Sheridan received the EarthForce Silver Star for valor
	during the Earth-Minbari war.

</ul>

<h2><a name="UQ">Unanswered Questions</a></h2>

<ul>

   <li> How long have the Centauri been using Babylon 5's space to move
	weapons?

   <li> Will the news report affect the public's perception of Babylon 5,
	and if so, will the station become more popular or less?

</ul>

<h2><a name="AN">Analysis</a></h2>

<ul>

   <li> Delenn's emotions seem to come to the surface much more readily now
	than they did before her change.  (see
	<a href="#JS:delenn">jms speaks</a>)

<p>
   <li> The Earth-Minbari War wasn't very devestating at all in terms of
	loss of life.  250,000 dead is tiny compared to, for example, the
	tens of millions killed in World War II.  Since most of the war
	was probably fought in space, in ships with relatively small crews,
	that's understandable -- in fact, that many dead probably means
	that Earth's combat fleets were nearly eliminated in their
	entirety -- but the war seems to have had an impact on
	Earth far greater than warranted by human losses.  Human pride may
	ultimately have been the bigger casualty.

<p>
   <li> The fact that the Narn cruiser destroyed a similarly-sized Centauri
	ship in a one-on-one battle suggests that the two are fairly evenly
	matched technologically.  If the Centauri are indeed crushing the
	Narn military, as denied by G'Kar, they must have far superior
	numbers, or frequent help from the Shadows.

<p>
   <li> One reason for keeping Babylon 5 around was conspicuously absent
	from Senator Quantrell's list: the planet below the station is one
	of the most strategically valuable places in the known galaxy,
	considering what lies beneath its surface (cf.
	<a href="018.html">"A Voice in the Wilderness."</a>)
	Given that the planet's contents were entrusted to the Babylon 5
	Advisory Council, it's in everyone's best interest to keep the
	station up and running.

	<p>
	Earth would probably prefer to keep the planet a secret to keep people
	from trying to take it (and Babylon 5), so it makes
	some sense that Quantrell didn't mention it; but given the battle
	that took place over control of the planet, it must be a poorly-kept
	secret at best.

</ul>

<h2><a name="NO">Notes</a></h2>

<ul>

   <li> <a name="NO:sub">"Subliminal"</a> text during the Psi Corps ad: "The
	Psi Corps is your friend.  Trust the Corps."

<p>
   <li>@@@841689985 Though the subliminal message was onscreen long enough
	to satisfy American television regulations, in France, the message
	was clipped out altogether due to tougher French rules.

<p>
   <li>@@@833749598 The Minbari have three languages: Lenn-ah, Fik, and
	Adrenato.

<p>
   <li> When present-day fighter pilots fire weapons, they say
	"Fox one" over their tactical radio frequency when they
	use radar-guided missiles, "Fox two" when they
	use heat-seeking missiles,
	"Fox three" for smart missiles, and "Fox four" (or
	"Guns, guns, guns") for guns.

	<p>
	Someone during the battle said "Fox five," suggesting
	some other sort of weapon.  ("Fox five" is also used
	for lighthearted remarks about midair collisions during dogfights!)

<p>
   <li> Interplanetary Expeditions, which has a brief ad at the beginning of
	the episode, is the same firm that financed Dr. Hendricks' dig on
	Ikara 7 in
	<a href="004.html">"Infection"</a>
	-- in which it was discovered to be a front for a bio-weapons supplier.

<p>
   <li> <a name="NO:pine">Note the pine-tree air freshener</a> on the bridge
	of the Heyerdahl during the teaser.

<p>
   <li> The Heyerdahl is probably named for Thor Heyerdahl, whose Kon-Tiki
	expedition attempted to prove that South American natives could have
	populated some South Pacific islands.

   <li> <a name="JS:about">"And Now for a Word,"</a> will, I
	think, be very popular, and to my knowledge does something that has
	never been done in SF television before.

<p>
   <li> Speaking of which...on Monday I turned in a script called "And Now For a
	Word."  It's probably the most unusual episode to date...so much so
	that I was very concerned about Warners approving it, and indicated in
	my letter (which explained why it was done, and why it should be
	produced) that I wouldn't be putting in for a script payment until I
	knew they would accept it and let us make it.  Finally heard back
	today that they've approved it.  This will be shot as episode 214, and
	what you've just read is ALL I intend to say about this script between
	now and shortly before it airs in May.  (Though when we cast the guest
	star, which we're in the process of selecting now, that I'll be able to
	announce.)  It's not controversial per se, but does take our entire
	show and put it on its head for the entire hour.  (I also had to make
	sure we *could* physically produce the darned thing prior to turning
	in the script.) No speculation, please; just let it be what it is, and
	see it cold.

<p>
   <li> For those who've been nudging other folks to try out B5, you may want
	to tell them that this coming batch of eps is probably the best time to
	dive in.  In particular, our second new show (airing the first week of
	May) is designed in part to help new viewers coming to the show to catch
	up on background.  (No, not a clip show, or anything like that...I think
	you'll like it.)  I also *strongly* recommend that you videotape this
	episode, entitled "And Now For a Word."  There's something in there just
	(or primarily) for the videotapers.  Consider this a heads-up from the
	inside.  You'll know what it is when you sorta see it.  (See
	<a href="#NO:sub">Notes</a>)

<p>
   <li> There's a thing you do in theater training where you're told to talk
	about a subject, never use the word "I" ...but in the end wind up
	telling us more about *you* than the subject you're speaking about.  So
	I began to wonder if I could apply this exercise, in a limited way, to
	an episode of the show.  I can't say more than that without spoiling
	things, but suffice to say you learn a lot about all kinds of people,
	and the way you learn it says a lot about those involved.  It's a
	*very* subversive and tricky episode, and I *very* much suggest taping
	it, so you can go back and check something out later.  You'll know
	what.  If you don't, you'll kick yourself later.

<p>
   <li> RE: the FCC...what we did in the commercial was totally legit.  We
	researched and found that the FCC considers a subliminal to be 2 frames
	per second (out of the standard 24).  So we made the blip 4 frames
	total.

<p>
   <li>@@@846703929 We've done a couple of steady-cam/CGI composite shots,
	but not that much; in "And Now For a Word," you'll sometimes see a
	floating recorder in C&C moving around...that was a steady-cam in use,
	and we composited in the CGI.  It is, however, time-consuming, so we
	only do that sort of thing as required.

<p>
   <li> <a name="JS:gov">The device of using a reporter's appearance</a>
	to go to another POV is
	not new to either B5 or MASH (though B5 is first to use it in SF).
	Where I would draw the distinction is in the sense that "Word" is
	actually very subtly subervsive.  It's ostensibly about B5 (the
	broadcast itself) but you learn a LOT about Earth in the process...how
	the government wants the Mars situation interpreted ("an Earth-loyal
	population held hostage by a violent minority"), the government
	changing back home (suddenly we have an Office of Public Information
	and a Ministry for Public Morale), how they see the end of the Minbari
	war, and so on.  It's designed to show more than just who's being
	interviewed; you reflect home as well.

<p>
   <li> <em>The battle shouldn't have been audible in the station, right?</em>
	<br>
	Except, of course, that you have a space batttle going on right
	outside B5, and explosions barely feet from the hull, plus debris
	hitting the shell of the station and making it ring, so you're going to
	hear stuff.  When the oxygen tank outside the main living area in
	Apollo 13 blew, it sounded like a bomb going off.  It happens.

<p>
   <li> Jeffrey Smith: your analysis of Delenn is dead-on...I don't quite
	think she really understood what was required of her, and what would
	happen; I think she believed it would go somewhat other than it has,
	which has given her pause, she's rattled, alone and realizing the
	magnitude of what is before her, and her choice to undergo the
	chrysalis.  And that is EXACTLY the core of a huge Delenn episode in
	the last part of this season.

<p>
   <li> <em>Why did the battleships keep missing each other?</em>
	<br>
	Actually, all sides in battle use ECM (Electronic Counter Measures)
	to throw off the targeting systems on the "enemy" vessels.  But usually
	it only takes a couple of quick firings to compensate (which is what
	we've done).

<p>
   <li> New Vegas is on Mars.

<p>
   <li> The reporter didn't talk to Talia because the story wasn't about
	what it's like to be a telepath.  That's a different story.  This was
	about B5 and those who run it.  Talia doesn't directly work for B5,
	she's employed by the Psi Corps.

<p>
   <li> The Torque- part of her name came from Torquemada, that's correct. 
	Just seemed appropriate since we were shortly doing an episode with an
	inquisitor.

<p>
   <li> After we made initial contact with aliens, first being the Centauri,
	there were a lot of disruptions to the social and religious and
	political paradigms, many of which are whole stories unto themselves.
	There was also a lot of paranoia running around.  Earthdome was
	constructed in Geneva to be more or less impervious to an initial
	assault from other races, should any come.  (It was really something
	of a fiction, the way the star wars defense program might not have
	been really effective, but the theory was to protect the seat of
	Earth government.)  So it dates back about a hundred years.  (And
	it's NOT in the middle of a blasted heath; that was done in the comic
	by the inker, who should've colored it a nice green.)

<p>
   <li> "Whoever thought up the idea of *security cams* for FX shots...."
	<br>
	That's how it was scripted.

<p>
   <li> G'Khamazad.
    
	<p>
	And G'Quon's primary follower/co-prophet was G'Lan.
     
	<p>
	Remember that name.

<p>
   <li> It's also worth noting that this was likely Delenn's first real
	encounter with Earth media/reporters on this level.  She's never been
	put into such a situation before, being challenged on-screen, which
	would be the height of disrespect back home.  (We refer to her desire,
	after this, to learn more about the press in a later episode this
	season.)

<p>
   <li> Very few have noted the play on the title.  The usual complete phrase
	is, "And now for a word from our sponsor."  So what was the only
	sponsored commercial shown (in the 2259 version)...?

<p>
   <li> <em>Interplanetary Expeditions was the bogus company from
	"Infection."  Is it more than just a throwaway here?</em><br>
	Yeah, I'd say it's fair to say that you haven't heard the last of
	Interplanetary Expeditions.  Remember the rule: before you use the gun,
	you show it on the mantle.  You play fair.  And create the context in
	which the payoff later works.

<p>
   <li> How can "Word" be a commentary on current allegations of bias (which
	I think are out of all proportion) since the media is now supposedly
	anti-government (nonsense), and the newscast in "Word" was more than
	just a bit spoon-fed government propaganda?

<p>
   <li> "Z'ha'dum" has only been seen by a few people at this early stage, but
	folks like it.  The big one, though, is really "And Now for a Word,"
	which has gotten more responses from crew, cast and others than any 
	other script to date.  From top to bottom, everyone is absolutely 
	excited about it.  It's going to be a very challenging shoot, but the
	result, I think,will be worth it.

</ul>
