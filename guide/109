<h2><a name="BP">Plot Points</a></h2>
<ul>

   <li>@@@911462615 The Alliance headquarters on Minbar (in Tuzanor, described
	in novel
	<a href="/lurk/novels/009.html">"To Dream In the City of Sorrows"</a>)
	has been completed, and Sheridan and Delenn have moved in.

   <li>@@@911462615 G'Kar has named Ta'Lon
	(<a href="033.html">"All Alone in the Night"</a>)
	as his successor on Babylon 5.

   <li>@@@911462615 Franklin has appointed Dr. Hobbs
	(<a href="059.html">"Interludes and Examinations"</a>)
	as the new chief of staff of B5's medlab, thanks to her diverse
	experience and her willingness to stand up for what she believes in.

   <li>@@@911462615 Tessa Holloran (Number One) is, Lochley and Sheridan agree,
	working out well as the new head of Alliance intelligence.  She's
	not joining Sheridan and Delenn and the rest of the Alliance cabinet
	on Minbar.  Sheridan feels that Babylon 5, as a center of commerce
	and travel, is a better venue for intelligence-gathering.

   <li>@@@911462615 Garibaldi has taken over the day-to-day operations of Edgars
	Industries.  Since the previous board of directors is gone
	(<a href="108.html">"Objects in Motion"</a>)
	he has gathered a group of the most vocal whistleblowers and critics
	from within the company and named them the new board.

   <li>@@@911504597 Lennier has, through inaction, tried to kill Sheridan.
        He has fled in shame and vowed not to return until he finds a way
        to redeem himself in Delenn's eyes.  This is just as the ghost
	of Morden prophesized in 
	(<a href="096.html">"Day of the Dead"</a>).

   <li>@@@911462615 Londo has given Delenn and Sheridan a gift for their
	child: an ancient Centauri urn, which Londo says is traditionally
	passed to the heir to the throne.  The urn contains a Keeper.

</ul>

<h2><a name="UQ">Unanswered Questions</a></h2>
<ul>

   <li>@@@911462615 Is the giving of the urn a real Centauri tradition as
	Londo claimed, or just something concocted by the Drakh to get a Keeper
	into Alliance headquarters?

   <li>@@@911462615 How can Lennier redeem himself?  Where has he gone?

   <li>@@@911547249 In
        <a href="088.html">"The Deconstruction Of Falling Stars"</a>
        we learn that a something newsworthy befalls Sheridan and Delenn's son
        David.  Could this have something to do with the keeper in the urn?


</ul>

<h2><a name="AN">Analysis</a></h2>
<ul>

<p>
   <li>@@@911462615 G'Kar's statement that Ta'Lon is as ready as G'Kar was
	when he first came to Babylon 5 echoes Londo's reassurance to Vir
	(<a href="106.html">"The Fall of Centauri Prime"</a>)
	that Vir would do at least as good a job as Londo had.

<p>
   <li>@@@911462615 Londo's request for alcohol during dinner was more
	emphatic than might be expected.  Has he already discovered that alcohol
	can put the Keeper to sleep
	(<a href="061.html">"War Without End"</a>)?
	If so, what was he hoping to say or do with the Keeper out of the way?
	Would he have warned Sheridan and Delenn about the Urn, told them about
	the Drakh, or something else?

<p>
   <li>@@@911462615 Delenn's ability to see the Keeper, if only vaguely,
	is reminiscent of her sense that Morden was touched by the Shadows
	(<a href="013.html">"Signs and Portents"</a>).
	In this case, though, it seemed she didn't quite know what to make of
	the sensation, since she didn't mention it to Sheridan after Londo
	left.  What enables her to sense Shadow influence?

<p>
   <li>@@@911462615 Londo believes the Centaurum will eliminate the position
	of Emperor after he's gone, which implies that he either doesn't believe
	or doesn't remember Lady Morella's prophecy that Vir would become
	emperor after Londo's death
	(<a href="053.html">"Point of No Return"</a>).
	Or, of course, the Keeper might have been forcing him to say what he
	said, in order to encourage Sheridan to accept the gift.

</ul>

<h2><a name="NO">Notes</a></h2>
<ul>

   <li>@@@911462615 The first Centauri imperial palace was built 2000 years
	ago, according to Londo.

   <li>@@@911462615 Minbari have no word for "goodbye."

   <li>@@@911462615 Zack believes he'll still be on Babylon 5 when they turn
	out the lights.

   <li>@@@911462615 Of the original major players from the start of the
	series, only Vir is still on the station.

</ul>

<h2><a name="JS">jms speaks</a></h2>
<ul>

   <li>@@@889482760 <em>When is the final day of season 5 shooting?</em><br>
	It's either March 20th or 21st, I forget....

<p>
   <li>@@@911504597 <em>Did you make any special notes in the script of "Objects
	At Rest"?</em><br>

	Yeah, my instructions to Chris were the same there as for
	another scene next week, "break our hearts."  And the two
	themes are actually pretty much the same, since they proceed
	from similar contexts.  That section of "Rest" just puts me
	away every time.

<p>
   <li>@@@921691787 <em>Will we ever find out what happened to Lyta
	and G'Kar?</em><br>
	I'm writing 3 B5 short stories for Amazing Stories magazine; the first
	is a Londo (shortly after he became emperor) story; also doing a
	G'Kar/Lyta story, and a B5-setting story, all following these
	characters after the events of "Objects at Rest."

</ul>
