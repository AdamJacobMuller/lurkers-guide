<p>
The ideas and observations in the above lists are collected from the
near-limitless resource of insight and enthusiasm that is the Internet.
Intellectual credit for the content goes to all of the contributors.
<p>
If you have any material to add, to this episode or <em>any</em> other, please
<a href="mailto:b5-lists@uhs.bsd.uchicago.edu">send it in</a>, to
<I>b5-lists@uhs.bsd.uchicago.edu</I>.  Include the episode and list
names in your subject line for organizational sanity.  Lists for old
episodes will be updated in light of information revealed in subsequent
ones.
<p>
<strong>Please note the following:</strong>
<ul>
<li> Your submitted material might not be included.  Your submissions may
be edited for grammatical or spatial considerations or may be
combined with other submissions.

<li> Credit will only be given on <A HREF="contributors.html">the
contributors page</A>, not on any of the lists themselves.  Let your
insight fly free to the skies of a hundred thousand minds. <P>
</ul>
If you send me something I'll assume you're in harmony with this. <P>

(Remember, please include the episode and list names in the subject line.)
