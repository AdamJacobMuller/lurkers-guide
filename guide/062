<h2><a name="BP">Backplot</a></h2>

<ul>
   <li> Lyta has previously carried "pieces" of Kosh with her.  This is
	most likely what she was doing at the end of
	<a href="048.html">"Passing Through Gethsemane."</a>

   <li> At least ten Narn ships have survived the battle with the Centauri,
	damaged but able to be repaired. A new Narn fleet seems to be gathering.

   <li>@@@864894608 It takes the White Star 20 minutes to recharge its jump
	engines after they've been taken offline and their energy diverted into
	the weapons systems.

   <li> The Vorlons are a long-lived race, are relatively few in number, and
	death is a rarity among them. It had been a very long time since a
	Vorlon had died.

   <li>@@@844797640 Franklin is a Foundationist.  The Foundation apparently
	borrows customs and beliefs from various cultures, perhaps in the
	belief that no one people has all the right spiritual answers.

</ul>

<h2><a name="UQ">Unanswered Questions</a></h2>

<ul>

<img src="/lurk/gif/062/vshipmsg.gif" border=1 width=160 hspace=2 height=120 align=right>
   <li> What was the message the Vorlon ship showed to Sheridan?

   <li> Lyta, a P5, could barely hold one Shadow ship at bay. How much
	telepathic energy is required to defeat a Shadow ship? What effect
	would a high-rated telepath like Bester have on a Shadow vessel?

   <li> Is Lyta still "only" a P5, or has she been enhanced by her relationship
	with Kosh?

   <li> Why does the new Vorlon insist on being called Kosh in public and
	private? What does he mean by his statement that "We are all Kosh?"
	(see <A HREF="#AN">Analysis</A>)

   <li> Where did the pattern in Kosh's quarters come from, and what does it
	mean? (see <A HREF="#AN">Analysis</A>)

   <li> Why did Lyta bleed from her eyes during the battle? Was it just the
	strain, or is there some deeper explanation?

   <li> Why didn't the forces of Light take the destroyed Shadow craft in tow
	for analysis?

   <li> Why didn't the Minbari cruiser open fire on the "held" shadows?

   <li> Lyta required 'line of sight' to the Shadow ship in order to attack it.
	Did the Minbari telepaths also need to see the Shadows in order to
	attack them?

   <li> How did the Vorlon ship know where to find Sheridan?

   <li> Does the "piece" of Kosh that may be left behind in Sheridan have
	anything to do with Sheridan's place as "The One?" How might it fit in
	with Kosh's statement that if Sheridan goes to Z'ha'dum, he will die?
	It may explain Kosh's final words to Sheridan: "As long as you're
	here, I'll always be here."

   <li>@@@847070191 Do the Shadows know a piece of Kosh survived?

   <li> Does the different style and color of the new Vorlon ambassador's
	encounter suit denote anything?

   <li>@@@871091092 Is this the same Vorlon who was on Minbar in
	<a href="060.html">"War Without End?"</a>

   <li> How did G'Kar manage to persuade the other races to come to Sheridan's
	aid in his battle against the Shadows?

<br clear=all>

</ul>

<h2><a name="AN">Analysis</a></h2>

<ul>

<img src="/lurk/gif/062/koshqtrs.gif" border=1 width=160 hspace=2 height=120 align=right>
   <li> The strange pattern which the new Vorlon sees on the screen in
	Kosh's quarters could be a representation of Kosh's death.  It could be
	construed as a diagram of two or more Shadows attacking a Vorlon. It
	could also be construed as a diagram of Shadows being accompanied by a
	human.  Presumably the human would be Morden, and the images were
	burned into the wall in some form, silhouettes, when Kosh was killed.

   <li> It's clear that Lyta believes, based on her vision, that Sheridan may
	hold part of Kosh within him. What that means -- for Sheridan, for
	Lyta, and for Kosh -- remains to be seen.

   <li>@@@844797979 How did the piece of Kosh get into Sheridan's mind?  If
	it was the result of Kosh's contact with Sheridan, might G'Kar also
	have a piece of Kosh following their contact in
	<a href="050.html">"Dust to Dust?"</a>

   <li>@@@844881004 More disturbingly, might Morden also have a piece of Kosh,
	present as he was at Kosh's death?  Perhaps that was why the Shadows
	brought Morden along; they wanted someone there who could carry
	part of a Vorlon.

   <li>@@@844797979 In
	<a href="033.html">"All Alone in the Night,"</a>
	Kosh tells Sheridan, "I have always been here."  Could he perhaps
	have been referring to Sheridan's mind, implying that Sheridan has
	carried a piece of Kosh for quite some time?

   <li> Might the statement that "We are all Kosh" suggest that the Vorlons
	exist more as a collective whole than as individual entities? (See also
	<A href="#JS">JMS speaks</a>.)

   <li> The tide may be turning, now that it's clear that telepaths are
	effective weapons against the Shadows, especially considering that all
	major races except the Narn have telepaths. (Which begs the question:
	what will the Shadows' response be?)

   <li>@@@844376937 Telepathic control over Shadow ships is tenuous at
	best, and may be limited to preventing them from attacking; the three
	ships being held by the Minbari telepaths were free to flee the scene
	when G'Kar and the others arrived.

   <li>@@@844376937 In
	<a href="024.html">"Revelations,"</a>
	G'Kar told Na'Toth that when Narn warships jump into normal space,
	they're briefly out of contact because of the energy drain of the
	jump engines.  Yet the G'Tok was able to fire on the Shadow warship
	before it even left the vortex.  Does that mean that the weapons
	systems take less energy than establishing faster-than-light
	communications?  Perhaps Narn FTL communication involves the use
	of the jump engines to beam a signal into hyperspace, and the
	effect in "Revelations" was simply a matter of the jump engines
	needing to recharge from the ship's main power source.

   <li>@@@844895893 The Shadows now probably know that the White Star is
	capable of solo jumps.  It seems Sheridan has decided that keeping
	that capability a secret is no longer of strategic importance
	(<a href="045.html">"Matters of Honor."</a>)
	Or perhaps he figures that the secret is out by now anyway, perhaps
	as of Delenn's emergence from a jump point in the White Star in
	close proximity to Babylon 5, and thus presumably in full view of
	a large number of people
	(<a href="054.html">"Severed Dreams."</a>)

   <li>@@@844376937 The new Kosh's ship is reddish in color, as is his
	encounter suit's eyepiece, perhaps suggesting the link between Vorlons
	and their ships.

   <li>@@@844900656 Every sentient race, according to G'Kar, has food resembling
	Swedish meatballs.  The Narn call it "breen."  Since the Vorlons have
	manipulated all the younger races, perhaps Swedish meatballs are really
	a Vorlon delicacy, part of an intricate plan to defeat the Shadows
	through culinary unity.

</ul>

<h2><a name="NO">Notes</a></h2>
<ul>

   <li> In Australian aboriginal cultures, a "walkabout" is a ritual in which
	a young man goes on a solitary journey through the wilderness in an
	attempt to learn more about his own character and strength.

<p>
   <li>@@@850757656 Metazine, the painkiller Cailyn used, was also used on
	Sinclair to keep him unconscious in
	<a href="008.html">"And the Sky Full of Stars."</a>

<p>
   <li>@@@844882197 <a name="NO.credit">In the initial UK broadcast, as</a>
	well as the first-run US broadcast, Patricia Tallman's first name
	was misspelled "Patrica" in the opening credits.

<p>
   <li> JMS wrote both songs in this episode.  See
	<a href="#JS.songs">jms speaks.</a>

<p>
   <li> When the ship bearing the new ambassador arrives, Sheridan originally
	says, "Welcome to Babylon 5."  This line was edited out later.

</ul>

<h2><a name="JS">jms speaks</a></h2>
<ul>

   <li> As it happens, as soon as I finish the two-parter, this
	week, the next script will  get a lot more into Lyta and the
	Vorlons and all that jazz.

<p>
   <li>@@@864605945 It came out pretty well; it's exceeded by Shadow Dancing, 
	Z'ha'dum and Rock, but it ain't bad.

<p>
   <li>@@@864605945 Re: "Walkabout," thanks...of the final 5, it's not at the top,
	but it ain't bad.  If you happen to be out of the house this coming
	Thursday, and miss "Grey 17 is Missing," you miss a little, but not a
	lot.  It's okay.  But the ones after that are just *killer*.

<p>
   <li>@@@864605945 <em>Was this supposed to come before "War Without
	End?"</em><br>
	Correct.  Initially we'd wanted to put Walkabout in first, but
	that would have meant airing only WWE1 in that sweeps period, and
	having to wait until the fall for part 2, which seemed not only
	excessive but remarkably stupid.  So we reversed the shooting/airing
	order to accommodate that, and the fact that we knew we'd need a LOT of
	EFX in WWE1, and this would give us time to do it properly.

<p>
   <li>@@@864605945 <em>Will the order be corrected when TNT airs the
	series?</em><br>
	Not really, because it doesn't make *that* much difference to
	risk confusing them about it....

<p>
   <li>@@@844882197 <em>About
	<a href="#NO.credit">Patricia Tallman's misspelled name</a></em><br>
	WHAT?!?!

	<p>
	Are you sure?  We changed it on my copies here.....

<p>
   <li>@@@844882197 (slow burn)

	<p>
	We delivered a corrected print ages ago.

	<p>
	Someone gon' DIE.

<p>
   <li> It's fair to say that Lyta has been...aided, slightly, in
	her abilities. But I'm not ready to pull the trigger on that one for a
	while yet.

<p>
   <li> The new Vorlon arrives in Walkabout.

<p>
   <li><em>Is the new ambassador the same as Kosh?</em><br>
	Actually, no, the replacement isn't Kosh, as you say, it's
	another Vorlon, with a very different personality...the "we are all
	Kosh" is more of a conceptual thing....

<p>
   <li>@@@864605945 I'd say this Kosh has a bit more of an edge to him....

<p>
   <li>@@@864605945 <em>Will we ever find out what was written on the side
	of Kosh's ship?</em><br>
	What, do I look like someone who can speak Vorlon?  Oh, sure, a few
	words, mainly "Where is the bathroom" and "What's that smell?" but to
	translate something like that...pfsh, please.

	<p>
	(Answer: probably not.)

<p>
   <li>@@@865960802 <em>What did the ship say?</em><br>
	"Welcome to Hawaii."

	<p>
	There was apparently a hideous malfunction...they never talked
	about it thereafter....

<p>
   <li> Franklin isn't gone from the show; he's in the very next
	episode, in a major way, and has a big part in "Shadow Dancing."  He
	just has a lot to work out right now.

<p>
   <li>@@@844912488 "When is walkabout a legitimate choice, and when is it
	a cop-out?"

	<p>
	When you're more afraid of what you're running *to* than what you're
	running *from*.

<p>
   <li> <a name="JS.songs">It's not widely known -- I guess
	mainly</a>
	because I haven't ever mentioned it much -- but from time to time I've
	written songs. Mainly the lyrics; I know how the music should sound,
	but I'm incapable of reading music...I think it's the same mental
	glitch that hits me when I try to do certain kinds of math.  "X is a
	numerical value." "No, X is a letter, 7 is a numerical value."  I can't
	ever seem to make the one equal the other in my head.  Similarly, a
	black note on a piece of paper isn't the music...anyway, it's a
	glitch.)

	<p>
	So when I write songs, and I have a specific melody I'm hearing
	in my head, I'm invariably placed in the humiliating position (since I
	can't play a musical instrument) of humming it, or somehow trying to
	suggest it to the music-person.  Suffice to say it looks really goofy
	and stupid.

	<p>
	Anyway...despite this, I do sometimes write songs, and like to
	keep my hand in, as they say.  I did two songs for an ABC-TV prime-time
	Real Ghostbusters special, did a few songs that have been recorded by
	small groups (you've never heard of any of them, trust me), another
	song that, much to my chagrin, is apparently still being used in church
	songbooks (and that's all I will ever say about that)...and when I
	decided to do a show with a singer for B5, I wrote a couple of songs
	for that one, with Chris Franke providing the music.

	<p>
	They're bluesy, Billie Holliday kinds of songs, updated
	slightly. I'm actually very pleased with how they came out (Erica
	Gimpel, one of the cast members from Fame, plays the part and sings the
	songs).  Several folks around here want either or both songs to come
	out on the next B5 album, but I"m loathe to do so, on the theory that
	the soundtracks work better in the style we've already used, all
	instrumental.  (There've even been some inquiries from music people
	who've heard the songs about releasing them commercially, but that
	would mean adding about 30 seconds to each song to make them airplay 
	compatible, and I'm not sure I want to take on the extra hassle just
	now.)

<p>
   <li> <em>Who did the music?</em><br>
	I wrote the lyrics, Chris Franke did the music.

<p>
   <li>@@@843430375 <em>Are the songs linked to elements of the
	story?</em><br>
	Not coincidences, no, but not quite as tightly linked as you suggest.
	Thematically indicative more than anything that points to story specific
	elements.

<p>
   <li>@@@843430375 I figured it might be cool to continue the song over the
	credits.  That happens one more time this season.

<p>
   <li>@@@844881146 Here's what I think is a bit of cultural short-sightedness.
	Everybody keeps saying, "well, if they had that kind of music,
	shouldn't it have been shown to be an oldies bar or something?"

	<p>
	Look at classical music for a moment.  Goes back to Beethoven,
	Brahms, Bach and lots of composers whose names don't even begin with
	B.  And earlier.  Now, I don't mean to alarm anyone or startle anyone
	with this revelation, but classical music is *still being written and
	performed* hundreds of years later.  Not old stuff, new stuff, of
	that school and in that style.  The orchestral suites in the Star
	Wars movies are strongly based on classical compositions...is that
	"oldies" stuff?  You've got one of the longest running musical plays
	running now in London, in "Phantom of the Opera," a *new* composition
	(well, mostly, knowing how Webber works).

	<p>
	Jazz and blues kinda formally began in the 1920s and 1930s, but its
	roots run back to spirituals and african-american music in the
	1800s.  And it didn't just stop suddenly in the 1930s.  There's still
	new material being written in that style now; so should Stevie Ray
	Vaughn's albums or performances have been labeled "oldies?"  After
	all, it's sixty years later and more.

	<p>
	Certain musical styles will stay with us for a long, long time.  Not
	performances based on old stuff, but new material in that vein, for
	those forms that have shown themselves to be enduring.  200 years
	from now, in addition to other forms, you're still going to have
	original blues songs, original classical compositions, original jazz,
	original compositions in the style of gregorian chants, on and on and
	on.

	<p>
	It's odd when people try to apply illogical rules to the future that
	don't apply now; no one said, as noted, that a Stevie Ray Vaughn
	concert should be billed as an "oldies" event, or an oldies
	bar...even though it's over half a century since serious blues
	started going...it's just silly.

<p>
   <li>@@@844028242 Vorlon ships come out backwards when possible to help
	decelerate.

	<p>
	Pat has interesting eyes...they're slightly larger than is the norm, and
	they take some getting used to.  Those eyes are one of the things that
	beckoned to me to cast her...they're the eyes of a telepath, who sees
	more than should be seen.  They're terrific eyes.

<p>
   <li> <em>So, were the shadows following Lyta, or were they an image on the
	wall?</em><br>
	They weren't following Lyta.  We were in Kosh's old quarters, and those
	images were burned into the wall when Kosh died.  Bear in mind that she
	doesn't actually meet the new ambassador until the next scene.
	
	<p>
	It was the same effect you would get in a massive energy burst that
	"paints" shadows on the wall, which only he could see.
	
	<p>
	Those are two different scenes; the first one takes place in Kosh's
	quarters, the second one out in the hallway.  Perhaps that could've been
	made clearer....

<p>
   <li>@@@843430375 <em>Garibaldi said he went over Kosh's quarters with a
	fine-toothed comb.  How'd he miss the image?</em><br>
	Watch the scene again; the first time the new Vorlon looks at the wall,
	he sees nothing; the next time he looks at it, the lens wide open, the
	image is somewhat distorted around the edges, and now he's seeing the
	afterflash.  Only certain types can see it.

<p>
   <li> <em>Is there significance to the different eye-piece colors
	of the two Koshes? Why no one would suspect Kosh suddenly
	having a different encounter suit?</em><br>
	No signicance to the eyepiece color; no reason to assume Vorlons only
	have one encounter suit their entire life.

<p>
   <li>@@@843430375 Actually, the new Vorlon's encounter suit is more
	purple/red than green.  The design is a matter of form following
	function.

<p>
   <li> <em>On differences between the two Koshes:</em><br>
	They're not that far apart in age, but yes, Kosh would be a bit
	older.

<p>
   <li> The look of the new Vorlon was developed by John Vulich of Optic Nerve
	based on my suggestions.  I got in after a bit and redesigned/sketched
	the headpiece a bit, and recommended the colors used.  We're actually
	doing a bit of fine-tuning on the new Vorlon prior to next season.<p>

<p>
   <li>@@@844880143 Re: the new Kosh...yeah, the look is intentional.  I
	worked with Optic Nerve to get the new lines right, messed with their
	sketches until I had what I wanted.  It's very effective in some lights,
	less so in others, but the sense comes across.

<p>
   <li>@@@889494600 <em>Is the new Kosh really Ulkesh from the novel
	<a href="/lurk/novels/009.html">"To Dream in the City of Sorrows?"</a>
	</em><br>
	The new Vorlon was Ulkesh, yes...the Kosh thing was meant in a
	Vorlon philosophical sense.  They ain't wired up like the rest of us.

<p>
   <li>@@@843430375 Sheridan commands the Army of Light, Delenn as second.
	If the AOL speaks with one voice on something of importance, they have
	to be listened to.  When Sheridan put himself on the front lines, he was
	then taking on the role of soldier, not commander.  They also felt it
	risked leaving them without said commander if it went wrong.

	<p>
	Bear in mind that their orders in *no* way compromised his actual
	mission, or over-rode his decision.  They were sending along a secondary
	mission to keep an eye on the primary mission.  I don't see a conflict
	here.

<p>
   <li>@@@843430375 Just some comparisons to illustrate...during
	WW II, the head of naval operations for the Japanese fleet insisted
	on being on board during several of their more pivotal missions.  His
	subordinates insisted that additional ships be sent as escorts given
	his importance to war strategy.  That's a very rigid military
	structure, but when *all* the subordinates get together on something,
	to go against it causes more problems than it's worth.

	<p>
	Even within the context of a conventional military situation, there's
	flexibility.  If a commanding officer gives an order which is
	immoral, illegal, or against the rules of engagement, a subordinate
	can refuse to implement that order, even give a countermanding order
	which, depending on the situation (such as a nuclear missile firing)
	would take precedence over the CO's order (though you'd first have to
	relieve the CO of command, and if you do that, you'd darned well
	better be prepared to back it up with every legal and moral means at
	your disposal, or it's mutiny).  Heck, it was just this kind of
	dilemma that was at the core of the movie "Crimson Tide," and was
	brought up in the recent war crime trials going on investigating what
	happened in Bosnia, with a soldier being asked why he didn't refuse
	to carry out an order to kill civilians.

	<p>
	Ain't a lot of black-and-whites in the world, but a whole lotta
	greys.

<p>
   <li>@@@843430375 There's nothing dangerous at all about a fleet coming out of
	hyperspace or a jump point together.

<p>
   <li><em>The UK cut Lyta's line from the Shadow battle, "Burn, you
	bastards!"</em><br>
	They cut that?  How curious...I didn't know that.  From what I'd seen of
	British TV, some shows use the word bastard like I use a comma, they're
	ubiquitous....

<p>
   <li>@@@843430375 <em>Why not use Bester in the test?</em><br>
	Because Bester is on Earth or Mars, can't just drop everything and come
	when beckoned, and it would take 3 days to get there, and they were in
	kind of a hurry to test this.  Besides, P10s are very few and far
	between; they're more likely to have lower levels as their main weapons,
	so best to see what impact those will have.

<p>
   <li>@@@844882375 The fragmentation or fractionalizing is also
	visually cued by the last shot of Franklin through the window, split
	into many versions of himself.

	<P>
	Re: the hand-on-shoulder gesture, from Marcus it was an
	upbraiding, stop-him motion, whereas from Sheridan it was one of
	congratulation.

<p>
   <li>@@@845974618 It's imagery, yes, of his still being fractured, still
	looking to find himself, as it were.

<p>
   <li>@@@843430375 <em>Why isn't Sheridan setting up propaganda to help
	turn the Shadows' allies, such as Earth, against them?</em><br>
	There's really no need for propgaganda.  By about now, everybody out 
	in this part of space knows the situation...and what's going on back
	home is secondary to winning the war.  Also, you can be sure that if
	they set up a network -- and who has time in the middle of a war -- you
	can be sure Earth would find some way to jam it.

<p>
   <li>@@@843430375 You're the leader of an isolated space station with a
	quarter million inhabitants, who need air, food, supplies, space,
	support.  You no longer have ties to Earth, no support from there, no
	money, so you have to rely on whatever docking fees you can get from
	other worlds.  You're in the midst of a war in which you have few
	resources, little money, allies that have a tendency to turn on one
	another, nobody's giving you a break, your position is tenuous as
	hell, you're constantly undermanned, shorthanded....

	<p>
	Now you tell me where the heck you're going to get the time,
	resources, money and manpower to launch a propaganda operation, which
	if you're going to broadcast (and what's the point otherwise?) on an
	interstellar basis is going to require extensive and expensive
	facilities, broadcast repeaters, tacyhon carrier wave generators to
	get around the time-delay aspects, writers, directors, broadcast
	engineers, spokespersons, propaganda specialists, psychologists,
	technicians, camera equipment, space in which to PUT all of this
	stuff...on and on and on.

   <li>@@@843430375 <em>The Minbari could help with the propaganda.</em><br>
	For starters, having just had a MAJOR WAR with the Minbari, which
	nearly wiped out Earth, and many folks back home *hating* the
	Minbari...do you think for one second that they're going to believe a
	word of what the Minbari say to them?  Do you think the government
	would allow this to go through unjammed?  Hell, EarthGov would have a
	field day with this..."See?  It's all alien propaganda, just like we
	told you, they're trying to destabalize Earth."

	<p>
	Second, I don't think the Minbari have the propagandists, writers,
	directors, and others needed to put together a propaganda network,
	and would find the whole idea immoral to begin with...and a couple of
	paragraphs of text are meaningless...Earthgov says "it's not true,"
	and it's your word against theirs.  That's why you must have
	absolute, unvarnished PROOF, otherwise it blows up in your face,
	which any journalist worth his or her salt knows.

<p>
   <li>@@@843430375 <em>Does the Army of Light have access to any of the
	Minbari's resources?</em><br>
	Yes, they do...but bear in mind that the Minbari are currently having
	their own problems.  The Grey Council has fallen apart, the Military
	Caste (as we'll see in one of the next episodes) is having some
	serious doubts about how the Religious Caste is handling things, and
	that much of the support given Earth (by way of B5) has been covert;
	the White Star program was launched in secret, and the greater amount
	of the Minbari population aren't aware they're so much "in bed" with
	the humans (as it were).  As far as they're concerned, we're
	apparently necessary to the plan, but not much more than that.  So I
	think they wouldn't be warm to the notion of extending their services
	overmuch to Earth.

<p>
   <li>@@@844882375 <em>Is the White Star more powerful than a regular Minbari
	cruiser because of the Vorlons' involvement in its design?</em><br>
	The Vorlons were cooperating in the recent past, yes, and it
	still takes a couple of Minbari cruisers under most circumstances to
	take out an immobilized shadow vessel, though one can do it if the
	firepower is concentrated and prolonged.
