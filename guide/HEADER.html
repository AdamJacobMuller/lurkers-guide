<h1>Episode guide entries</h1>
 
If you want to see a much nicer-looking list, please use the
<a href="../eplist.html">episode list</a>
page.  This display is for people who want to see when the entry for a
particular episode was last changed.

<p>
Note that an episode is listed as modified here if anything at all has
changed, even something as minor as fixing a typo in a character's name.
