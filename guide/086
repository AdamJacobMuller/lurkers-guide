<h2><a name="BP">Plot Points</a></h2>
<ul>

   <li>@@@876782152 Sheridan's plan for the frozen telepaths
	(<a href="058.html">"Ship of Tears"</a>)
	was to smuggle them onto as many Earth warships as possible and
	activate them.  The telepaths would wake up and merge with the ships'
	computer systems, making the ships unable to maneuver or attack and
	thus removing the need for Sheridan's forces to destroy them.  The
	plan succeeded in disabling the better part of the Earth fleet at
	the Mars colony.

   <li>@@@876781979 Sheridan's forces have arrived at Earth, prompting
	President Clark to commit suicide rather than face capture or trial.
	A member of the Earth Senate, apparently friendly to Sheridan, has
	at least temporarily filled in the power vacuum.

   <li>@@@876781979 Marcus has used the alien healing machine
	(<a href="021.html">"The Quality of Mercy"</a>)
	to give his life to Ivanova, apparently dying in the process.

</ul>

<h2><a name="UQ">Unanswered Questions</a></h2>
<ul>

   <li>@@@876781979 What happened to the telepaths on the destroyers?

   <li>@@@877127172 Was Bester's lover Carolyn
	(<a href="058.html">"Ship of Tears"</a>)
	among the telepaths used against the destroyers?  Did she survive?

   <li>@@@876781979 What was meant by "The ascension of the ordinary man" on
	Clark's suicide note?  (See
	<a href="#AN.ordinary">Analysis</a>)

   <li>@@@876781979 Did Clark have a vice president?  Will he or she become
	the new head of the Earth Alliance, and if so, will Earth continue
	the policies of the Clark administration?

</ul>

<h2><a name="AN">Analysis</a></h2>
<ul>

   <li>@@@877200229 When General Lefcourt addressed the fleet at Mars, he
	didn't bother repeating Clark's propaganda about Sheridan's forces
	being under alien influence.  That could be a sign that few people
	in Earthforce really believed it anyway, so there was little point
	maintaining the pretext.  Or it could have been a result of his
	knowledge of Sheridan; that might lead him to believe that Sheridan
	would take up arms against Clark of his own free will.

<p>
   <li>@@@877200229 Both Sheridan and Lefcourt were in charge of Omega-class
	destroyers, and they both displaced the destroyers' usual captains.

<p>
   <li>@@@884246713 The device Franklin placed on Lyta was most likely the
	one he mentioned developing in
	<a href="082.html">"The Exercise of Vital Powers."</a>
	He claimed to be working on a repeater to help broadcast her thought
	patterns.

<p>
   <li>@@@876781979 The formation of the assault team on Mars was planned
	oddly; all the top-ranking people were together in a single
	group (Garibaldi, Number One, Lyta, and Franklin,) which would
	have been disastrous if they'd failed to take over the outpost.
	However, it's not an arrangement without merit: Franklin and
	Lyta obviously had to be together for him to hook her up to the
	device, and Number One probably wanted to keep an eye on both
	Garibaldi and Lyta.

<p>
   <li>@@@876781979 After her bad treatment at the hands of Sheridan and
	company, treatment which forced her to reassociate herself with the
	Psi Corps
	(<a href="082.html">"The Exercise of Vital Powers,"</a>)
	Lyta was surprisingly willing to put herself on the line yet again.
	Has her arrangement with Bester made her comfortable enough to set
	aside her past annoyance with Sheridan and the B5 crew, or does she
	simply believe so strongly in the cause that she's willing to
	disregard personal considerations?

<p>
   <li>@@@877286086 Marcus viewed several log entries from Franklin.  The
	first referred to the death of Cailyn, Franklin's lover in
	<a href="062.html">"Walkabout."</a>

	<p>
	The second might have referred to Marcus' recovery from his
	fight with Neroon in
	<a href="063.html">"Grey 17 Is Missing,"</a>
	although at that time Franklin was on walkabout and thus couldn't
	have recorded the log entry -- a possible gaffe.  It couldn't have
	referred to any event before
	<a href="055.html">"Ceremonies of Light and Dark,"</a>
	since Franklin was wearing his Army of Light uniform.

	<p>
	The third, of course, was in reference to the use of the alien
	healing machine on Garibaldi in
	<a href="024.html">"Revelations."</a>
	Franklin's flashback recounted
	<a href="024.html">"Revelations"</a>
	as well.

	<p>
	These log entries paralleled Marcus' own dilemma.  The first dealt
	with the death of a woman Franklin cared about.  The second (assuming
	it truly referred to
	<a href="063.html">"Grey 17 Is Missing"</a>)
	was the last time Marcus was willing to give up his life for a woman
	he cared for, namely Delenn.  And the third message was a warning about
	the consequences of what Marcus was contemplating.

<p>
   <li>@@@876858859 <a name="AN.ordinary">The phrase on Clark's suicide</a>
	note ("The ascension of the ordinary man") is a cipher, but it might
	have some discernable meaning.  The theme of death leading to
	ascension is common in religion; perhaps the "ordinary man" referred
	to the innocent civilians who'd be killed by the defense platforms,
	and Clark believed they'd ascend to heaven.
	
	<p>
	There's also an echo of Cartagia's belief that his involvement with the
	Shadows would allow him to ascend to godhood; though Cartagia's belief
	was rooted in Centauri religion (other emperors had been elevated to
	godhood, as noted by Vir in
	<a href="022.html">"Chrysalis"</a>)
	it's possible Clark believed the same was true of himself.

	<p>
	It's also possible that "ordinary" referred to non-telepaths: by
	scouring Earth's surface, a mundane was determining the fate of his
	evolutionary superiors, thus ascending above them.

<p>
   <li>@@@876781979 How did the Senator know so quickly what Clark had done,
	and how much damage the particle beams could cause Earth?  One
	possible answer to the second question is that the potential
	danger to Earth might have been discussed in the Senate, for
	example while debating funding of the defense platforms.  And
	perhaps the control panels on Clark's desk made it obvious
	that he'd turned the defense platforms against Earth, though the
	implication is that she guessed his plan simply from the words
	"scorched earth."

<p>
   <li>@@@876781979 It's odd that the Agamemnon was the only ship available
	to destroy the last defense platform, since only moments earlier it
	was in the midst of a swarm of other friendly vessels.  Obviously
	this was a matter of artistic license, but why couldn't one of the
	Minbari cruisers, for example, have fired a beam weapon at the 
	platform from a distance?

<p>
   <li>@@@876783815 Now that Sheridan's forces have removed Earth's defenses
	to a large extent -- the orbital platforms are all gone, many ships
	have been destroyed, and the advanced destroyer group is no more --
	an aggressive alien government, perhaps the Drakh
	(<a href="076.html">"Lines of Communication"</a>)
	might consider this an ideal time to try to attack Earth or some of
	its colonies.  Sheridan may have to station some of the White Star
	fleet and/or the League ships at Earth to help make up for the damage
	his campaign has done and ensure Earth's security.

<p>
   <li>@@@876783815 On the other hand, after Earth has had a chance to build
	up its forces again, it may be far in advance of the rest of the galaxy,
	even the Minbari.  Assuming Sheridan relinquishes command of his
	fleet to Earthgov now that Clark is out of the picture, Earth will
	have both Vorlon and Shadow technology at its disposal.  Given that
	some progress has obviously been made in integrating Shadow technology
	into Earth's
	(<a href="085.html">"Between the Darkness and the Light"</a>)
	it's not implausible that the Vorlon technology in the White Stars --
	not to mention their Minbari components -- could be analyzed by the
	same researchers.  Will the Minbari stand for that if it's attempted?
	How much do they value their current technological edge over the other
	major races?

<p>
   <li>@@@877072454 <a name="AN.iphigenia" href="085.html#AN.agamemnon">The
	parallel between Greek myth and Sheridan's command of the Agamemnon</a>
	has further resonance here, especially the variant in which Agamemnon's
	daughter Iphigenia is saved from death by Artemis.  Marcus, a
	self-described virgin
	(<a href="069.html">"The Summoning"</a>)
	has brought Ivanova back from the dead (assuming the alien device
	does in fact successfully revive her.)  What parallel, if any, there
	will be with the rest of the myth -- Iphigenia living the rest of her
	life in a distant temple, far from her family -- remains to be seen.

</ul>

<h2><a name="NO">Notes</a></h2>
<ul>

<p>
   <li>@@@877912167 The design of the rocket launching from Mars just before
	and after the opening credits may be a visual homage to the
	<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/x-33/dcx_menu.htm">DC-X,</a>
	a prototype of a reusable lightweight space vehicle.  DC-X performed
	eight test flights between 1993 and 1995.

<p>
   <li>@@@876786524 Effects glitch: One of the destroyers attacked by the White
	Stars at Mars was the Nemesis.  Unfortunately, the Nemesis defected
	to Sheridan's side in
	<a href="081.html">"No Surrender, No Retreat."</a>
	Of course, it could have been one of the fake defectors
	(<a href="085.html">"Between the Darkness and the Light"</a>)
	and gone back to Clark's side after gathering information about the
	rebel fleet.

<p>
   <li>@@@877199937 Effects glitch: When the fleet first approaches Earth,
	it's daytime in east Africa, Asia, and the Indian Ocean.  But when
	the Agamemnon is about to ram the defense platform, North America
	is in sunlight.

<p>
   <li>@@@877110295 Clark's suicide and note are similar to a scene in the
	film "Dr. Strangelove."  In the movie, a base commander launches a
	nuclear strike against the Soviet Union.  As troops try to break in
	to capture him and get the abort code, he shoots himself.  They
	discover on his desk a sheet of paper with mad ramblings and a number
	of circled letters.

	<p>
	And of course, many real despots in history have committed suicide
	rather than be captured by the enemy, such as Adolf Hitler.

</ul>

<h2><a name="JS">jms speaks</a></h2>
<ul>

<p>
   <li>@@@876965010 <em>The episode seemed rushed.</em><br>
	Okay, one general response here...people are seeing rush where in many
	cases there is NOT a rush.  Look, pay attention here: WE'RE IN THE
	FOURTH ACT OF THE EARTH CYCLE.  Like the fourth act of an episode, you
	have to really start cranking.  You want it to be at white-heat once
	you hit the ground.

	<p>
	What's in Endgame, and most of Between... was always going to be there,
	with or without a 5th season.  I made my trims in the period PRIOR
	TO these episodes, for the most part.  

	<p>
	This is the culmination of something we've been building now for three
	years, and I'm going to make it as damned fast-paced as I can.  

	<p>
	So don't go into this assuming it was rushed...it's *fast*, and that's
	the difference here.  

	<p>
	People complain when we do character stories that the arc isn't moving
	fast enough...people complain that it's moving too fast when the arc is
	in full gear...sombody get a concensus going here, okay?

<p>
   <li>@@@879013222 <em>How did you fit so much into one hour?</em><br>
	It's one of those things I don't know if I can explain adequately,
	or sensibly.  A lot of it is totally instinctive, I don't sit down
	and think about it, I just do it.  But to dissect...part of it is
	the intensity of the scenes, I think.  Strong emotion extends
	time, stretches it; if you've ever been in a major traumatic
	situation, a few minutes can seem like hours.  The more you can
	put your character into a situation of intense emotions, and
	create those same emotions in the viewer, you will in effect slow
	down perceived time.

	Also, there's the matter of context here.  If you've set something
	up in prior episodes, in something like "Endgame" there's no
	set-up which means exposition and chews up time; you go right for
	the high point in the story bell-curve, and you stay there.  So
	the part you're used to seeing take only a few minutes at the end
	of an episode becomes almost the entirety of the episode; same
	result.

<p>
   <li>@@@877629093 <em>What is Earth Standard Time?  GMT?</em><br>
	Yes, EST = GMT.

	<p>
	And this episode wasn't rushed; it's what you do when you're
	bringing any story to its climax.  It's like watching Aliens, going
	away before the last 20 minutes, coming back and saying, "Well, it
	moved awfully fast."  It has to, you're in the big moment.  No, there
	isn't time for everything, there is NEVER time for everything, there's
	always stuff we might want to see...but what's in Endgame is what was
	always going to be in Endgame.  If I'd known there would be a 5th
	season at the time, I still would've written it exactly the way it was
	written.

	<p>
	The collapsing was done for the most part *long* before we ever
	got to this part of the season.

	<p>
	It's just fast because that's what you need to do at this point.

<p>
   <li>@@@878327267 A hideous amount of rendering power and time went into
	that episode, and the result is all there on-screen.  The only bigger
	CGI feast is in the prequel, which is approximately 21% EFX, most of it
	pure CGI and composites.

<p>
   <li>@@@877023683 <em>The Mars surface effects looked different.</em><br>
	Actually, most of the prior mars shots were done by an outside
	contractor, who's been doing such shots for the history of the show.
	NDEI's boys wanted a chance to do them, and did so.

	<p>
	They're not bad...we still need to improve a bit on the movements, and
	the camera still moves a bit too fast, which gives it that computer-y
	feel...but overall, not bad.

	<p>
	<em>How long did those shots take to render?</em><br>
	Quite a lot, I understand.

<p>
   <li>@@@877629418 <em>Has Mars' air pressure been increased so pressure
	suits are no longer needed?</em><br>
	My feeling is that there's been some small terraforming, which
	has helped a little, but there's still a long way to go.

<p>
   <li>@@@877708577 One thing we've noted is that there's been some minor
	terraforming on Mars over the 175 or so years we've been there.  It's
	still a hostile climate, but not as bad as it is right now.

<p>
   <li>@@@877629093 <em>Shouldn't moving around the surface of Mars look
	odd due to its lower gravity?  Or has its gravity been increased
	somehow?</em><br>
	No, there was no change to the gravity...what should we see to
	show that the gravity was still less?  Someone like Garibaldi is still
	going to weight about 75 pounds, so he's not about to go around
	floating or bouncing, that's pretty solid.  I don't see many
	13-year-olds walking around like they're on the moon....

<p>
   <li>@@@877941352 "If you had time to spare in the episode (ho ho), you
	might have
	suggested the different ratio of inertial mass to weight by having
	character's feet skid out from under them when stopping, bouncing off
	walls while turning corners, overbalancing on turns, or catching things
	they had dropped two seconds after dropping them.  Maybe tossing a CGI
	grenade."

	<p>
	Except, of course, this would've looked awfully silly on camera.

	<p>
	BTW, remember that Number One and Garibaldi, as well as Lyta,
	have experience with living on Mars, so they would automatically
	compensate.

<p>
   <li>@@@876965010 <em>Wouldn't the ship's quartermaster notice a frozen
	telepath arriving?</em><br>
	In something like this, you don't move unless you have the main
	quartermaster at the Mars base ON YOUR SIDE.  You stuff it all into
	cargo loaders and crates, and ship it up.  Have you ever seen military
	shipments?  I looked into this, and security for big crates like this
	is done *at the point of shipping*. 

<p>
   <li>@@@880879145 "What was needed was at least talk of a major Mars
	resistance attack occuring at the same time to draw off the security."

	<p>
	There was.  Go back to the scene on the Apollo when the first
	word of attacks comes in...it says specifically that they're hitting a
	number of places *including* a White Star hitting that particular base.

<p>
   <li>@@@877629418 <em>How did Marcus contact B5 through the
	jammers?</em><br>
	Because Marcus sent the signal to B5 before the fleet jumped
	into hyperspace, leaving Mars, toward Earth.  We in hyperspace for the
	result, the search being concluded based on what was downloaded.

<p>
   <li>@@@876965010 <em>Why didn't Sheridan send another ship after
	Marcus?</em><br>
	You don't send a ship away to chase one person when you're
	going into a battle.  You don't KNOW what ships you are and
	aren't going to need.  In theory  you took everything you had
	because you thought you needed it.  Yeah, Marcus was a friend,
	but a lot of friends would die this day.  You think he would
	put Marcus's situation ahead of the fleet?  Isolate one ship
	and risk it to go after him?  Ever been in the military?  You
	talk about it, but what you propose doesn't make sense.  Would
	Patton have sent back a tank because somebody fell behind? No.

<p>
   <li>@@@876017761 <em>Garibaldi's betrayal didn't have any lasting
	consequences.</em><br>
	You're right in terms of what Garibaldi did and didn't do, and we've
	avoided the ultimate repercussions in other places for other things
	(he said vaguely, not wanting to post spoilers)...but you can only do
	that so far, and if you go further you start cheating.  You also
	remove the dramatic impact of the actions of your characters if they
	do not have consequences.
	
	<p>
	<em>Why did Marcus have to do what he did?</em><br>
	In this case, it ties very much into this
	character's background...and would, in another universe in which CC
	decided to stay, have spun out into some rather interesting
	developments.

<p>
   <li>@@@877971306 "Well, unless its a coincidence, the "circled doodled
	message left by
	madman after he commits suicide" is VERY similar to what happens in Dr.
	Strangelove. Again, maybe its JMS's homage to Kubrick (like the "2001"
	style spacesuit that appeared in a second or third season episode, I
	forget which, of B5)."

	<p>
	Just to clarify this....

	<p>
	Re: the note...the script as written calls only for the finding
	of a note with the words "scorched earth" on it.  It was John
	Copeland's idea to do the note as shown, and yes, he's said quite
	openly over on AOL that it was his nod to Strangelove.  (John directed
	that episode.)

	<p>
	Re: the suit...that wasn't an intentional 2001 nod...we went to
	Modern Props to get a space suit for Babylon Squared, and the only one
	they had on hand that would work for us was one left-over from 2010,
	which I asked the folks in costume to change as much as
	possible...though it was pretty much what it was regardless.  So that
	one wasn't intentional.

<p>
   <li>@@@877026658 <em>What did Sheridan mean by "ramming speed?"</em><br>
	You are in a space ship, in a vacuum, heading toward target X.  You
	understand that it takes time to transfer energy and movement toward
	another plane, so you go at X-speed toward that object if you want the
	option of applying thrusters and angling away from the object before
	you slam into it.

	<p>
	If, on the other hand, you *want* to hit the object, and you have no
	interest in holding back your thrusters to allow you to diverge from
	the target in the amount of space remaining between you and it, you
	proceed at Y speed, with your thrusters putting out their maximum
	amount of fuel.  

	<p>
	Y = ramming speed.  

<p>
   <li>@@@877368135 "...the symmetry and symbolism in how you structured that
	final battle.  The story of Babylon 5 basically started with the Minbari
	fleet coming to Earth to destroy it at the Battle of the Line.   To
	have the Minbari fleet return to Earth, not to destroy humanity, but to
	save it, especially along side Earth fighters and capital ships was
	stunning."

	<p>
	Noticed that little touch, did you....?

	<p>
	What goes around, comes around.

<p>
   <li>@@@876965010 <em>How did the Apollo monitor Sheridan's situation if
	communications were being jammed?</em><br>
	The jammers are set up to cut off communication OUTSIDE MARS
	ORBIT.  That's what was said, that the jammers cut in once they
	were past Mars (for security purposes).  The same thing was
	said in Lines Of..., where Franklin was having a hard time
	getting word to B5 *past the Mars jammers*.  Further, if all
	communications were cut off in Hyperspace, inside Mars orbit,
	then you couldn't have had ship-to-ship communications to tell
	Sheridan ABOUT Marcus, could you?

<p>
   <li>@@@877629418 Lefcourt does not think that his job is to set policy
	or overthrow presidents.  The military executes orders that emanate
	from the head of the government, through the chain of command.  Once
	that chain of command was changed, the orders were no longer valid.

<p>
   <li>@@@876858996 <em>Why wasn't Clark allowed to present his point of
	view, even at the end?</em><br>
	I tried to do it through his lieutenants and plenepotentiaries (hope I
	spelled that right, I'm too tired to get the dictionary down).  ISN
	gives you his point of view, ditto for Nightwatch, MiniPax, others.  I
	think if I had him just saying it out loud, it would diminish him much
	the way that repeated exposure to the shadow vessels gradually removed
	their mystery and menace. Less is more.

<p>
   <li>@@@877629093 <em>About the return of the old ISN anchor</em><br>
	"I've been thinking about the rapidity of her return to ISN.  I agree
	that there wasn't time to break her out of prison and get her old
	dressing room back for the morning news"

	<p>
	When the Soviet Union fell, and the prison doors were thrown
	open, a number of reporters who had fallen out of favor with the Party
	and were sitting in cells walked out, went across the street, and went
	on the air within a matter of hours.

	<p>
	Humans are resilient and determined sorts.
