<h2><a name="BP">Plot Points</a></h2>
<ul>

   <li>@@@932976564 The original inhabitants of the planet Lorka 7 were
	wiped out a long time ago, but the details are unknown.  The new
	inhabitants, who were led to the planet five hundred years ago by
	a being they call "The Most Holy," have agreed to let the Excalibur
	land and investigate to see what happened to their predecessors.

   <li>@@@932976564 Lochley and Gideon have consummated their budding
	relationship.

   <li>@@@932976564 Max was a child prodigy, always getting beaten up in
	school for being smarter than his peers.  He had a lonely life until
	he met a woman named Cynthia Allen; the two of them were married for
	some time, but she eventually left when it became clear that his
	devotion was more to IPX than to her.  Her business, trading alien art
	and antiquities, was devastated by the quarantine of Earth.

</ul>

<h2><a name="UQ">Unanswered Questions</a></h2>
<ul>

   <li>@@@932976564 Who or what was the Lorkans' "Most Holy?"  A Vorlon?
	Why were they led to Lorka 7?  Where were they before then?

   <li>@@@932976564 What wiped out the previous population of Lorka 7?

   <li>@@@932976564 What other alien artifacts does Max have in his
	quarters?

</ul>

<h2><a name="AN">Analysis</a></h2>
<ul>

   <li>@@@932976564 Dr. Chambers was clearly no stranger to fighting.  Was
	she formally trained?  Perhaps she has served in Earthforce; on the
	Excalibur it's not entirely clear whether she's a civilian.

   <li>@@@932976564 Five years after the founding of the Alliance, Babylon 5
	is still teeming with activity.  Yet a decade and a half later, at
	the time of Sheridan's death
	(<a href="110.html">"Sleeping in Light"</a>)
	it's considered useless.  What happens in the intervening years to
	cause people to stop coming to the station?

</ul>

<h2><a name="NO">Notes</a></h2>
<ul>

   <li>@@@932976564 Lochley likes to retreat to Downbelow when the stresses
	of running the station become too great.

   <li>@@@932976564 Just after the shower scene, a ship is shown entering
	B5's docking bay.  This is a tongue-in-cheek variant on an old
	cinematic metaphor, more typically rendered as a train going into a
	tunnel.

   <li>@@@936120474 Tim Choate, who plays Polix, was Zathras in the original
	series.

   <li>@@@932976564 Dedication:
	<blockquote>
	In Memory of Mister Kitty<br>
	198? to May 17, 1999<br>
	Now chasing star-mice
	</blockquote>

</ul>

<h2><a name="JS">jms speaks</a></h2>
<ul>

   <li>@@@932976564 "I presume that Mr. Kitty was yours?"

	<p>
	Yup.

<p>
   <li>@@@932976564 <em>Was the Lorcan at the end played by Wayne
	Alexander?</em><br>
	No, it wasn't Wayne, and the name slips away at the moment.

</ul>
