<h2><a name="BP">Plot Points</a></h2>
<ul>

   <li>@@@865323625 Sheridan's forces have liberated the colony at Beta
	Durani, as well as a midrange military outpost.

   <li>@@@865323625 Lyta is able to awaken the implanted telepaths
	(<a href="058.html">"Ship of Tears."</a>)
	After observing the effect of her mental contact with them, Franklin
	has devised an artificial equivalent and feels he's well on his way
	to reviving them.

   <li>@@@865621220 Garibaldi is still in love with Lise.

   <li>@@@865621220 Edgars runs the fourth-largest corporation
	on Earth.  His company is involved in chemical and biological
	weapons manufacturing as well as pharmaceutical production.

   <li>@@@865545104 Edgars says President Clark has become increasingly paranoid
	since taking office.  Learning of the Shadows' interest in Psi Corps,
	Clark developed an interest as well.  As his paranoia increased, he
	started giving the Corps more and more power, since telepaths were able
	to tell him absolutely whether the people around him were loyal.  The
	Corps, of course, isn't eager to give up its newfound clout, and
	Edgars and others fear that if Sheridan takes his battle to Earth,
	Clark may panic and give the Corps unprecedented control over society,
	a development that wouldn't be easy to reverse.  He therefore wants
	Sheridan's campaign stopped for Earth's own good.

   <li>@@@865621220 Clark's forces still haven't located Sheridan's father.

   <li>@@@865323625 According to Edgars, the real power in Earthdome has never
	been in the hands of the politicians; the mega-corporations have
	always called the shots.  They let Clark declare martial law, but
	didn't foresee the Psi Corps connection until it was too late.

</ul>

<h2><a name="UQ">Unanswered Questions</a></h2>
<ul>

   <li>@@@865323625 What does Sheridan plan to do with the telepaths?

   <li>@@@865364116 Will Psi Corps come looking for the murdered telepath?

</ul>

<h2><a name="AN">Analysis</a></h2>
<ul>

   <li>@@@865621220 Lise tried to warn Garibaldi off.  Why?  How much does
	she know about what her husband is planning?  How far will she go to
	protect Garibaldi?

<p>
   <li>@@@865968765 Garibaldi said Mars had tried to kill him before.  One
	of those occasions was his trek across the surface with Sinclair
	(<a href="004.html">"Infection"</a>
	and issues 4-8 of the
	<a href="/lurk/comic/">comic series.</a>)
	What were the other two?

	<p>
	The incident that killed Frank Kemmer
	(<a href="011.html">"Survivors"</a>)
	has been suggested, but Garibaldi said that took place on Europa,
	not Mars.

<p>
   <li>@@@865797858 He also said he'd sworn never to come back to Mars.  But
	in
	<a href="019.html">"A Voice in the Wilderness part 2,"</a>
	he told Lise he had some leave coming up and was thinking of taking it
	on Mars.  Maybe he only considered that after he realized Lise was in
	danger during the uprising.

<p>
   <li>@@@865622080 In
	<a href="080.html">"Moments of Transition,"</a>
	Bester claimed in his log entry that Garibaldi was inching closer to
	where Bester needed him to be.  It's plausible that Bester has been
	priming Garibaldi to join up with Edgars.  The Corps seems to be
	aware of the telepathic virus (the assassins in
	<a href="078.html">"Conflicts of Interest"</a>
	were likely Corps operatives) and is thus probably aware that Edgars
	has some interest in it.  Given the presence of the virus, they
	wouldn't be able to use a telepath as an undercover agent.  Setting
	up a non-telepath to be their spy and/or saboteur in Edgars'
	organization would be the Corps' only recourse, and they'd have to
	do it with subconscious programming since Edgars isn't above using
	telepaths to test potential employees' loyalties.

	<p>
	Garibaldi was a logical choice because the Corps knew of his connection
	to Lise; in
	<a href="018.html">"A Voice in the Wilderness,"</a>
	Garibaldi asked Talia to look into Lise's condition by going through
	Corps channels.  It wouldn't be much of a leap for the Corps to assume
	that Lise would therefore recommend Garibaldi to her husband, making
	Garibaldi the best possible candidate for the job of unwitting spy.

<p>
   <li>@@@865706778 Edgars appeared to accept Garibaldi's answer that he
	didn't remember what happened to him while he was missing
	(<a href="068.html">"Whatever Happened to Mr. Garibaldi?"</a>)
	Given how paranoid Edgars is in other respects, will that really be
	the end of the matter?  Does Edgars know more than Garibaldi does
	about what happened? Perhaps Edgars' seeming trust of Garibaldi is
	really an application of the old adage, "Keep your friends close, but
	keep your enemies closer."

<p>
   <li>@@@866938139 During his questioning, Garibaldi told Edgars, "Everyone
	lies."  In
	<a href="008.html">"And the Sky Full of Stars,"</a>
	Sinclair said the same thing to Garibaldi, and elaborated: "The innocent
	lie because they don't want to be blamed for something they didn't do,
	and the guilty lie because they don't have any other choice."

<p>
   <li>@@@866938139 Garibaldi stood in front of a mirror during his
	questioning, staring at his own reflection.  But the mirror was
	warped, distorting his image.  Garibaldi studied the image as he spoke;
	perhaps he viewed it a metaphor.  Garibaldi also studied his reflection
	in
	<a href="078.html">"Conflicts of Interest."</a>

<p>
   <li>@@@865728347 The telepath indicated that Garibaldi was telling the truth
	when he claimed not to remember what happened during his absence.  Yet
	Garibaldi has had flashes of memory, so that answer wasn't entirely
	honest.  Was the telepath lying herself, perhaps to protect the
	interests of the Corps, or did Garibaldi simply believe he was telling
	the truth, in that he can't recall more than brief cryptic flashes?

<p>
   <li>@@@865364116 The people in Edgars' laboratory are presumably telepaths.
	If that's true, their condition is probably related to the telepathic
	disease Garibaldi learned about in
	<a href="078.html">"Conflicts of Interest,"</a>
	and the drug Edgars' people were withholding was most likely derived
	from the substance Garibaldi helped smuggle through the station.

	<p>
	It's worth noting, however, that the placement of the sores on the
	patient's face were very similar to the insertion points of the
	Shadow implants in the telepaths on the station.  Perhaps Edgars
	managed to get his hands on some implanted telepaths and is performing
	his own experiments on them.

<p>
   <li>@@@865706271 It's also possible the substance Garibaldi saw wasn't a
	cure for the virus, though that was implied by Edgars here in that there
	was clearly some drug that can be given to ease whatever illness his
	test subjects were suffering from.  If instead Edgars is developing
	the virus itself with the intent of releasing it and wiping out all
	human telepaths, spreading rumors before its release about a
	genetic flaw inherent in telepaths might help deflect suspicion later.

	<p>
	Or, to take it further, Edgars may be producing both the virus and
	the cure, with the intent of infecting Earth's telepaths then using
	availability of the cure -- which apparently requires continuous
	usage -- to gain control over the Corps himself.

<p>
   <li>@@@865969018 Franklin said Sheridan hadn't changed since returning from
	Z'ha'dum, "except for..."  He stopped himself before completing that
	sentence.  Was this just a reference to Lorien's life-restoration
	energies, which Franklin noted in
	<a href="070.html">"Falling Toward Apotheosis?"</a>
	Or does he know about something else?

<p>
   <li>@@@865364116 Assuming Sheridan asked Franklin to bring the newly
	awakened telepaths with him to Mars, it's likely he's anticipating
	some kind of conflict with the Psi Corps when he moves to liberate it.
	Given Franklin's reaction, it's unlikely Sheridan proposed anything as
	innocuous as using the telepaths to help shield members of the Mars
	resistance from detection.

	<p>
	It's also not clear where the frozen telepaths' loyalties will lie
	even if Franklin manages to extract their implants and give them back
	control of their own minds.  They're all fugitive telepaths ("blips,"
	as Bester called them in
	<a href="058.html">"Ship of Tears"</a>)
	so presumably have no love for the Corps, but that doesn't necessarily
	mean they'll be willing to act on Sheridan's behalf.

	<p>
	Of course, that assumes Sheridan wants Franklin to give them back
	mastery of their own thoughts; perhaps his order was instead for
	Franklin to find a way to use the implants to take control of the
	telepaths.

<p>
   <li>@@@865787203 Given the frozen telepaths' effect on computer systems,
	one possible use would be to smuggle them onto Mars and wake them up
	near some of Earth Force's communication network; they'd presumably
	throw it into disarray and allow Sheridan's forces to move in on a
	disorganized enemy.

<p>
   <li>@@@865364116 Lyta's expanded powers were in evidence again.  The psi
	rating of the telepath in Medlab was never mentioned, but Lyta was
	telepathically strong enough to force him to stop in his tracks
	as he tried to kill himself.  If she can do that to a fellow telepath,
	who presumably would have instinctively tried to block her, can she
	do the same -- or worse -- to a normal human?

<p>
   <li>@@@866938418 The awakened telepath didn't react reflexively to Lyta's
	Psi Corps badge the way Carolyn did in
	<a href="058.html">"Ship of Tears."</a>
	Why not?  He wasn't merged with any machinery as Carolyn was, so he
	couldn't have thrown lightning bolts.  But he didn't appear
	to react at all.  Perhaps the Shadows' anti-Corps conditioning wasn't
	universally applied.

<p>
   <li>@@@865622552 Lyta's indignant response to Zack's request was likely
	brought on by his previous request that he scan Garibaldi
	(<a href="080.html">"Moments of Transition."</a>)
	That request may have led her to automatically assume the worst when
	Zack asked for her services.

<p>
   <li>@@@865622456 Edgars and Clark may believe that Clark is using the
	Psi Corps, but it's just as plausible that by now, they're using him.
	The Corps could feed misinformation to Clark in order to bolster its
	own standing, and since, as Edgars said, Clark is trusting the Corps
	to ferret out liars and turncoats, he'd be unable to tell that they
	were leading him on.

</ul>

<h2><a name="NO">Notes</a></h2>
<ul>

   <li>@@@854134623 The title is a reference to Aristotle's definition
	of happiness: "The exercise of vital powers
	along lines of excellence in a life affording them scope."

<p>
   <li>@@@865970223 Edgars alluded to "Clark's 'Night of the Long Knives.'"  
	That's a reference to Roman history,
	when, in the year 31 AD, the emperor Tiberius had his aide Sejanus and
	his followers killed in a purge.

	<p>
	A more recent use of the same term was to describe Hitler's
	<a href="http://www.historyplace.com/worldwar2/timeline/roehm.htm">purge</a>
	of the rival SA faction of the Nazi Party in 1934.

<p>
   <li>@@@865442107 The title as shown at the top of act one is missing
	the leading "The."  But the "The" was present in the pre-show
	information screen on the initial US satellite feed, and it's
	present in the episode listings sent out by Warner Bros., so
	it's included here.

<p>
   <li>@@@865621220 Both Edgars and Sheridan love fresh orange juice
	(<a href="025.html">"The Geometry of Shadows."</a>)

<p>
   <li>@@@884248227 Continuity glitch: When Lise and Garibaldi are talking
	in his room, after she brings him dinner, she starts to leave, but
	stays and closes the door most of the way.  After she's done talking,
	Garibaldi moves across the room to her and shuts the wide-open door.

</ul>

<h2><a name="JS">jms speaks</a></h2>
<ul>

<p>
   <li>@@@865498639 It's a very different feel...leisurely, in a way, but no
	less tense.  A good addition to the mix.

<p>
   <li>@@@865969998 One thing on the line Wade speaks...the actor consistently
	got the line wrong.  It read, "Everything is illusion, Mr. Garibaldi;
	<em>constructs</em> of light, language, metaphor," rather than concepts.

	<p>
	There is a subtle but distinct difference.

<p>
   <li>@@@865498639 Garibaldi's said he doesn't trust telepaths ever
	since the pilot movie.  It's a question of degrees at this point.

<p>
   <li>@@@875077421 <em>What book was Edgars reading when Garibaldi walked
	in?</em><br>
	The Bible.

<p>
   <li>@@@866152425 <em>Were the scars on the sick telepaths from the removal
	of implants?</em><br>
	No, just standard lesions.

	<p>
	Remember, a man as smart and rich as Edgars can surely afford
	private lesions for his "kids."

</ul>
