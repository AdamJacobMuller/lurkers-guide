<h2><a name="BP">Backplot</a></h2>
<ul>

   <li> After the victory over the Dilgar, the Earth Alliance experienced a
	period of rapid expansion bolstered by a general sense of optimism,
	a sense that the future was bright.  Somewhere along the way, that
	was lost -- Dr. Franklin says the future was like waiting for that special 
	toy for Christmas, and when you get it you find that the reality doesn't 
	measure up to your expectations.

   <li> Dr. Franklin studied medicine at Harvard.  One of his teachers, Dr.
	Everett Jacobs, went on to become then-Vice President Clark's personal
	physician.  Dr Franklin says, "A lot of us looked up to him as a role model.
	He's the best there is."


   <li> Dr. Jacobs examined Clark before and after the "accident" on Earth
	Force One that killed President Santiago -- and found no evidence of
	the viral infection Clark used as an excuse to leave the ship
	shortly before it was destroyed.

</ul>

<h2><a name="UQ">Unanswered Questions</a></h2>
<ul>

   <li> How and when will Dr. Jacobs' data be used?

   <li> What did Kosh and his ship say to each other after Sheridan and the
	others left the docking bay?

   <li> What did Kosh teach Sheridan?

   <li> How did Sheridan convince Kosh to allow his ship to be used to save
	Dr. Jacobs?

   <li> What did the ship "sing" to Dr. Jacobs?

</ul>

<h2><a name="AN">Analysis</a></h2>
<ul>

<p>
   <li> Why was the fact that Kosh's ship is alive such a surprising thing
	to have confirmed, when a simple "scan for life forms" was able to
	detect it?  In all their surface probes while the ship sat in the
	docking bay, it seems odd that nobody
	thought to scan for life, especially since it was already known or at
	least suspected that Vorlons use organic technology (cf.
	<a href="004.html">"Infection."</a>)

<p>
   <li> Sheridan mentions to Kosh that there's a council meeting to discuss
	the Narn refugee problem.  That might be related to the smuggling
	operation started in
	<a href="034.html">"Acts of Sacrifice"</a>
	-- has it been revealed already?  (Not necessarily, of course; there
	are probably thousands, if not millions, of refugees who have nothing
	to do with that operation.)

<p>
<a href="/lurk/gif/035/writing.jpg"><img
align=right width=128 height=96 src="/lurk/gif/035/writing.gif"></a>
   <li> Kosh speaks to his ship, and it displays some text in an unknown
	script, presumably the Vorlon written language.  That implies that
	Kosh and his ship are not in telepathic contact, or at least not
	when he's not on board -- somewhat remarkable, considering that Kosh
	and the ship have both demonstrated telepathy or something like it
	(Kosh in
	<a href="033.html">"All Alone in the Night"</a>
	and the ship in this episode, both with Dr. Jacobs and, more
	importantly, the maintenance workers referred to by Ivanova.)<br clear>

<p>
   <li> <a name="AN:outfit">There may be a Ranger</a> (cf.
	<a href="031.html">"The Coming of Shadows"</a>)
	in this episode, though it's very subtle.  As Sheridan and Garibaldi
	reach the bottom of the stairs, just before Sheridan sees the red
	ribbon, a man walks by the two of them, wearing the same outfit as
	the Ranger from the aforementioned episode.  Which might be
	coincidence, except that Garibaldi notices the man, even turns and
	watches him climb the stairs, before looking back at Sheridan, who
	is meanwhile occupied with the ribbon.

<p>
   <li> A couple viewers have commented that Sheridan looks a bit <em>too</em>
        smug as he gives the data crystal to his co-conspirator at the end,
        almost as if that isn't the real crystal.  Is it?  Does he trust
        her?  Is he up to something other than what the General thinks he is?
        (Recall that we never heard his answer in
        <a href="033.html">"All Alone in the Night."</a>)
        Also, he doesn't give her Dr. Jacobs' code to unlock the data, though
        of course he could simply be giving her an unencrypted copy.

<p>
   <li> On a related note, did Sheridan keep a copy of the crystal for himself?

<p>
   <li> Sheridan confronts Kosh twice.  The first time a bit tentatively, the second time 
	directly.  Amazingly, he engages Kosh's interest and actually begins what may 
	develop into a dialog (or at least a monologue) with Kosh.

<p>
	Also of note, the first time Sheridan confronts Kosh he says that Kosh "called to 
	him."  This is a reference to the dream sequence in <a href="033.html">"All Alone in the Night"</a>.
	Kosh replies, "I sought understanding.  I listened to the song.  Your 
	thoughts became the song."  Sheridan asks, "Has this ever happenned before?" 
	and Kosh says, "Once."  <em>When was that?</em>  One possibility is
	Talia Winters (cf.
	<a href="009.html">"Deathwalker"</a>)
	-- Kosh told her to "listen to the music, not the song."

<p>
   <li>	Kosh's second conversation with Sheridan, of course, bears close analysis,
	especially given its relation to Sheridan's dream in
	<a href="033.html">"All Alone in the Night."</a>

	<ol>

	   <li><b>Sheridan: "You wanted to see me?"</b>
	   <li><b>Kosh: "<em>You</em> wanted to see <em>me.</em>"</b>
	   <li><b>"Well, I guess everybody does.  See what you really are,
		inside that encounter suit."</b>
	   <li><b>"They are not ready.  They would not understand."</b><br>
		<em>Analysis:</em> It's not obvious exactly who he means by
		"they."  At least <em>one</em> person was ready to
		see Kosh, namely Delenn (cf.
		<a href="022.html">"Chrysalis."</a>)
		Of course, it begs the question once again:
		what <em>is</em> Kosh, that one might not "understand" when
		one saw him?  (And why does he care whether people understand?)
	   <li><b>"Am I ready?"</b>
	   <li><b>"No.  You do not even understand yourself."</b><br>
		<em>Analysis:</em> Is Kosh speaking in a general sense here --
		"You aren't self-actualized" -- or is there something specific
		about Sheridan that Kosh knows and Sheridan doesn't?
	   <li><b>"Could you help me to understand you?"</b>
	   <li><b>"Can you help me to understand <em>you?</em>"</b>
	   <li><b>"Well, I can try.  Is that what you want?  An exchange of
		information?  I tell you something about me, you tell me
		something about you?"</b>
	   <li><b>"No.  You do not understand.  Go."  Kosh turns away.</b>
	   <li><b>"Dammit, what do you want?  What do you want from me?  You
		know, ever since I got here I've had the feeling that... that
		you've been watching me.  The records show you hardly ever
		went to council meetings until I showed up.  When I was
		captured... it was you who reached out and touched my mind.
		Now you call me here... why?  Just to throw me out?  Are we
		just toys to you?  Huh?  What do you want?"</b>
	   <li><b>Kosh spins around to face Sheridan again.  "Never ask that
		question."</b><br>
		<em>Analysis:</em> Almost undoubtedly a reference to Morden's
		question in
		<a href="013.html">"Signs and Portents"</a>
		-- but it raises another question of its own, namely, why does
		that question mean anything special to Kosh?  How does Kosh
		know what Morden asked of the various ambassadors?  Perhaps
		it's what the Shadows always ask, since Kosh seems to know
		about them.  Perhaps the Vorlons were, themselves, asked that
		question a thousand years ago.
	   <li><b>"At least I got a response out of you.  So what'll it be,
		Ambassador?"</b>
	   <li><b>"I will teach you."</b>
	   <li><b>"About yourself?"</b>
	   <li><b>"About <em>you.</em>  Until you are ready."</b>
	   <li><b>"For what?"</b>
	   <li><b>"To fight legends."</b><br>
		<em>Analysis:</em> Two interpretations are immediately
		apparent: "to fight the Shadows" (who are legendary to the
		Narn and probably others) or "to dispel myths."  The first
		seems <em>too</em> obvious, given Kosh's tendency to be
		cryptic.  The second interpretation suggests that the Vorlons
		aren't revealing themselves because they feel they'll be
		associated with something from mythology.  Once Sheridan
		learns to combat those preconceptions, he will be ready.
                (See <a href="#NO:cend">Notes.</a>)  Alternately, it could
		refer to Sheridan himself; he's a legend of sorts to the
		Minbari, possibly an obstacle to the joining of humans and
		Minbari as envisioned by Delenn (cf.
		<a href="033.html">"All Alone in the Night."</a>)
	
	</ol>

<p>
   <li> Do we now have a clue to the telepathic abilities of the Vorlons?
	This reference to "the song" and Sheridan's thoughts "becoming" the
	song during his dream sequence hint rather strongly that telepathy
	is the Vorlon's primary means of communication.  If so, then this
	confirms that Sheridan's dream wasn't altogether a dream, and that
	he may have some latent/budding psi skills himself.

<p>
	Further note:  The constant jabber that occurs when Kosh speaks.  It sounds like 
	there are...many "voices" in it.  If telepathy is common to 
	Vorlons, then they may have some equivalent to a "hive mind", or at least constant 
	and unbounded access to each other.  If so, then why does Kosh periodically return 
	to the Vorlon homeworld?  Further, does the same physical "Kosh" return?  Still 
	further, if each Vorlon is to a greater or lesser extent <em>all</em> Vorlons, does it 
	matter which physical Vorlon is present?  Taken to the extreme, the tag "Kosh" is 
	simply a convenient referent supplied by the Vorlon hive-mind to the folks at B5.
	(Of course, it may well be the <em>ship</em> that needs to return
	home, not Kosh at all.)

<p>
   <li> In this episode we see that the ship is an independent entity, in essence a 
	living creature.  It shows up as a non-human life form, even though we are shown 
	that Kosh himself was not on board.  Further, Doctor Jacobs says that the ship 
	"sang to him" while he was unconcious and aboard.  This hints strongly that the 
	ship shares, "the song", which means that it's part of the Vorlon community mind.

<p>
	If the ship is part of the Vorlon super-entity, and if the ship is itself, "organic 
	technology" then this implies that the Vorlons can create any kind of physical 
	creature they want, with that creature sharing the community mind.  That means 
	that the ship is nearly as much or as much a Vorlon as Kosh.

<p>
   <li> A number of readers have speculated that the ship is actually Kosh,
	and the encounter suit just a remote probe or a servant.  That seems
	unlikely, though, given the events of
	<a href="000.html">"The Gathering,"</a>
	in which the Vorlons were ready to start shooting over an attack on
	what was in the encounter suit.  But it's worthy of mention.

<p>
   <li> A Biblical reference that might be relevant, or might just be a
	coincidence:  During Sheridan's secret meeting,
	Sarah tells him "Whatever you do, I suggest that you do it quickly."
	This is the same thing Jesus Christ said to Judas Iscariot
	immediately before Judas went out to betray Jesus to the Sanhedron.
	If this isn't a simple coincidence, the implication is that Sheridan
	will eventually betray someone.  The victim isn't clear, though.
	His cadre on B5 are obvious
	candidates, as is the cabal he and Hague are members of. But for that
	matter, it might be the Psi-Corps (though his betrayal could be
	<em>for</em>
	the Psi-Corps (cf.
	<a href="033.html">"All Alone in the Night"</a>
	and Bester's comment at the end of
	<a href="030.html">"A Race Through Dark Places."</a>)

	<p>
	A more whimsical connection is that the actress speaking the line
	is named Wanda de Jesus.

</ul>

<h2><a name="NO">Notes</a></h2>
<ul>
   <li> <a name="#NO:cend">A relevant reference</a> might be "Childhood's
        End" by Arthur C. Clarke (though the shape of the Vorlon encounter
        suit suggests the opposite association from the one in the book.)

   <li> When Franklin and Garibaldi stop to eat, it appears they're actually
        munching on Kellogg's NutriGrain Breakfast Bars (though the scene
        doesn't provide a close enough look at the bars to tell for sure,
        so it probably doesn't count as product placement.)

   <li> During Sheridan's meeting with Sarah, they are in what looks like an
	equipment room.  She sets up two devices, presumably to defeat any
	bugs or scans. The problem is that she leaves them there when she
	leaves.  During their next meeting they are not in evidence at all,
	and again she isn't shown retrieving them before she leaves.  Of
	course, Sheridan could have taken them.  (See
	<a href="#JS:light">jms speaks.</a>)

   <li> In addition to its ants (cf.
	<a href="006.html">"Mind War"</a>)
	B5 has roaches.

   <li> Sheridan has what he considers very good shielding on his office.  He 
	talks to Ivanova quite openly there immediately after Agent Cranston leaves.

   <li> Kosh's comments to Sheridan bear some resemblance to the Dalai
	Lama's observation (cf.
	<a href="023.html">"Points of Departure,"</a>)
	namely, "It will be even better when you begin to understand what
	you do not understand."

</ul>


<h2><a name="JS">jms speaks</a></h2>
<ul>

   <li> There was no intended reference to Anne McCaffrey's story; Kosh tends
	to speak naturally through a series of musical/tonal/atonal chords,
	and I figured his ship would communicate in the same way, which to
	another would sound a little like singing.

   <li> <a name="JS:light"><em>What did Sarah leave behind at the
	meeting?</em></a><br>
	It's a flashlight, and he's also holding one.  You caught 
	a very small glitch.  Originally, he came out, flashed twice with 
	his flashlight, giving the code; then she did the same, and 
	THEN stepped out of the shadows, putting her flashlight down on 
	the ledge beside her.  It took too long, though, interminably, 
	so when we edited it, we cut out that sequence...and 
	hoped nobody'd notice the flashlight sitting there.

   <li> From "Infection," the visiting Doctor points out that, regarding
	organic technology, "some even say the Vorlons have got it."  All 
	this stuff gets set up somewhere.

</ul>
