<h2><a name="BP">Backplot</a></h2>
<ul>

   <li> Minbari clans are like close-knit families.  One surrenders some of
	one's identity to the clan, and in return the clan is expected to
	shoulder the responsibility for one's actions.  Despite this, clan
	leaders sometimes engage in secret plots without the knowledge of
	the clan members at large.

   <li> Sheridan's tactics in the Earth-Minbari War (cf.
	<a href="023.html">"Points of Departure"</a>)
	are considered completely without honor by many Minbari; he used a
	fake distress signal to lure the Black Star into a minefield.

   <li> Vir was considered a failure by his family.  He was sent to Babylon 5
	at their behest, mostly to get him out of their hair.  There was little
	competition for the post, which was thought to be something of a joke.

</ul>

<h2><a name="UQ">Unanswered Questions</a></h2>
<ul>

   <li> What was Sheridan supposed to learn from Kosh's lesson?  (see
	<a href="#lesson">Analysis</a>)
   <li> How did Kosh know what Sheridan would find in the chamber?
   <li> Who were the people living there?
   <li> Will Vir's family take him up on Londo's offer?
   <li> What fate awaits the teddy bear?
   <li> Who was the human who stole Sheridan's link?  Did he have an ulterior
	motive for helping with the setup, or was he simply doing it for
	money?

</ul>

<h2><a name="AN">Analysis</a></h2>
<ul>

   <li> Considering her dramatic entrance, Sheridan's lawyer didn't actually
	do much of anything.  Who sent her, and what was she supposed to
	be doing for Sheridan?

<p>
   <li> <a name="lesson">One interpretation of Kosh's lesson</a>
	is that he was teaching Sheridan to give humanity the benefit of the
	doubt.  Even in what Sheridan considered the most dangerous, nasty
	place on the station, one can find beauty.  If Kosh's pledge in
	<a href="035.html">"Hunter, Prey"</a>
	to teach Sheridan "about <em>you</em>" is taken broadly to mean
	"about your kind," this is at least a plausible scenario.

<p>
   <li> Another possible interpretation:
	Going to the darkest, dingiest, "worst part" of B5 was an analogy to
	Sheridan's current very "bad" situation.  This is partly confirmed by
	Kosh's statement that having a "bad day" was perfectly appropriate for
	the lesson he had planned.  What Sheridan saw there was "beauty... in
	the dark", which was exactly what he needed.  He was obviously relaxed
	and feeling much better after the experience, and he thanked Kosh for
	helping him.

	<p>
	The lesson?  When things are at their absolute worst, don't simply
	satisfy your basic needs (eating, sleeping), take time out to enjoy
	something that will make you feel better despite the conditions.  It
	will help you deal with adversity.  Alternatively, the lesson is that
	even in some of the worst places/situations, there can still be beauty
	if you allow yourself to look for it.

<p>
   <li> Why the monastic chant?  Sheridan said in
	<a href="023.html">"Points of Departure"</a>
	that he had met the Dalai Lama in Tibet.  The chant wasn't Tibetan --
	it is a Gregorian chant, part of the Christmas Mass.
	The entire incident may have been projected into Sheridan's mind
	by Kosh or by someone else.  The fact that Sheridan could see it
	might also be related to his dream in
	<a href="033.html">"All Alone in the Night."</a>

	<p>
	The Latin lyrics:

	<blockquote>
	Puer natus est nobis et filius datus est nobis;<br>
	cujus imperium super humerum ejus;<br>
	et vocabitur nomen ejus,<br>
	consilii Angelus.<br>
	<br>
	Cantate Domino canticum novum;<br>
	quia mirabilia fecit.
	</blockquote>

	<p>
	One English translation of which is:

	<blockquote>
	Unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given;<br>
	on whose shoulders the world's dominion rests;<br>
	whose name is;<br>
	He who was sent to us from the great Heavenly Wonder-Counselor.<br>
	<br>
	Sing unto the Lord a new song.  He has made wonders.
	</blockquote>

	<p>
	There are two quotes here, one from Isaiah 9:6, the other from Psalm
	98:1:

	<blockquote>
	For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government
	shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful,
	Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.
	</blockquote>

	<p>
	<blockquote>
	O sing unto the Lord a new song; for he hath done marvellous things:
	his right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the victory.
	</blockquote>

	<p>
	Whether this particular chant has any bearing on the story, or was
	just selected because it sounds good, is an interesting question, but
	a couple rather tenuous connections can be made:

	<p>
	The second verse mentions a "hand" being
	victorious; recall that Sheridan was told, "You are the hand," in
	<a href="033.html">"All Alone in the Night."</a>

	<p>
	The fourth issue of the
	<a href="/lurk/comic/index.html">comic series,</a>
	dealing with Sinclair's appointment to the Minbari homeworld, is titled
	"The Price of Peace," one letter removed from the description of Jesus
	above.  (That one is probably just a coincidence.)

<p>
   <li> It's also worth comparing Kosh's lessons to his encounter with Talia in
	<a href="009.html">"Deathwalker."</a>
	When she asked what his negotiations meant, he advised her to "listen
	to the music, not the words" -- advice that might apply to Sheridan's
	lesson as well.

<p>
   <li> The plight of the teddy bear mirrors the story Sheridan told to
	Delenn; if the bear is really supposed to represent Sheridan, is its
	fate perhaps a foreshadowing of Sheridan's?

</ul>

<h2><a name="NO">Notes</a></h2>

<ul>

   <li> Londo's mention of "a certain Minbari" lying is probably a reference
	to Lennier's lie in
	<a href="021.html">"The Quality of Mercy."</a>

<p>
   <li> The Centauri expect their dolls to be anatomically correct.

<p>
   <li> "Honour and shame from no condition rise;<br>
	Act well your part, there all the honour lies."<br>
	- Alexander Pope, "An Essay on Man" Epistle IV, 1733-34

<p>
   <li> Possible Ranger sighting: When Vir and Londo are talking in the
	Zocalo, a man in what looks like a Ranger uniform walks by twice.
	Once as Vir says, "Centauri Prime is sending a replacement," and
	again as he says, "It's my problem, not yours."

<p>
   <li> The bear is from the
	<a href="http://193.118.187.101/help/bear/info">Vermont Teddy-Bear Company.</a>
	It's a "twenty inch" with "JS" embroidered on the front and
	"Bear-ba-lon 5" on the back.  Peter David says:

	<blockquote>
	Specifically, on page 13 of their 1994 Winter Collection Catalogue,
	they have the Custom Embroidered Bears. Ordered with a baseball shirt
	and hat (NOT jacket), he's 20 inches high and his
	fur color is 'Pockets (thick milk chocolate)'...

	<p>
	I should point out that ordering the bear for Joe was my wife's idea.
	She's a big bear fan. At present she's hard at work on a
	Min<em>bear</em>i...

</ul>

<h2><a name="JS">jms speaks</a></h2>

<ul>

   <li> So after I'd read Peter's script, and decided to go with it, he
	asked about Ivanova's line, "This isn't some kind of Deep Space
	franchise, this place is ABOUT something."
	<p>
	"Are you really going to use that?" he asked.
	<p>
	"Absolutely," I said.  "It's fall-down funny."
	<p>
	Long pause.  "You people really ARE dangerous over there, aren't you?"

<p>
   <li> No, the scene in the dark with the robed figures was not enhanced
	with CGI or any other device.

<p>
   <li> Everything featured in the Babylon Emporium was just made up by us.
	Insofar as I know, none of it is real merchandise.  (Everyone, 
	including the crew, are so starved for B5 stuff that when we finished 
	filming the ep, we sold off the stuff, at cost, to those in the crew
	who wanted them.  Two guesses who wound up with the Londo and G'Kar 
	dolls....)

<p>
   <li> The B5 model in the gift shop in "Honor" is now in Sheridan's office, 
	bronzed, as is his right as captain.
	<p>
	Once the show is finally off the air, be assured that the model will 
	end up in THIS captain's office.

<p>
   <li> Here's the story of the bear.

	<p>
	I hate cute.  Everybody knows me, knows that.  So after buying Peter
	David's script #2, Peter sends me a gift.  A bear.  A teddy bear.  With
	my initials JS in front, and Bear-ba-lon 5 in the back.  I call Peter
	back.  I say that I must now get him for this.  He asks what I had in
	mind.  I said wait and see.

	<p>
	So I wrote the entire bear thing at the end of the show, and inserted
	it into his script.

	<p>
	Never send me something cute.

	<p>
	Best part was during filming, we shot the bear against blue-screen
	to be composited into the CGI.  And there's our EFX supervisor, standing
	there on film, against blue-screen, with this long rod up the teddy
	bear's ass, spinning it round and round and round....

	<p>
	Whilst doing that, I also wrote and inserted the Kosh/Perfect Beauty
	scenes, since I was already in it at that point anyway, and I figured
	it'd be cool.

	<p>
	It also keeps the Sheridan Learning Stuff thread going, and works in
	a nice balance to the rest of the episode.  Here he's going nuts, being
	harrassed, and his command is on the line...so he has to learn to bend
	his knee, accept silence, give up his command symbolically by giving up
	the stat bar, and finding one perfect moment of peace.

<p>
   <li> Yes, Kosh asking Sheridan "what is this place?" was more for
	his benefit than Kosh's, to underline where they were, and what he was
	about to experience even in such a place.  Also, in psychotheraputic
	terms, specifically dream analysis, when you travel to your cellar in
	your dream, it's in part to confront something in your subconscious, to
	learn something that may not be expressable in words.

<p>
   <li> Yes, he did send a fake distress call, and took out the Black Star
	when it came in to (they thought) wipe out a disabled ship.  He's never
	denied this to anybody.

<p>
   <li> Sheridan sent an EA distress
	signal; the Minbari were in genocidal mode, so it didn't matter to them
	the condition of their enemy.

</ul>
