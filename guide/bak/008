<ul>

<li> <A NAME="BP:1">In the days before the Earth/Minbari war,</A>
     Dr. Franklin used to hitchhike starships, trading his services as
     ship's doctor in exchange for free passage to places he'd never
     been before.

<li> <A NAME="BP:2"><B>Franklin:</B></A> "Towards the end, when things
     got bad for our side, those of us involved in xenobiology were told
     to hand over our notes to be used in genetic and biological
     warfare. [...]  I took an oath that all life was sacred.  I
     destroyed my notes, rather than have them used for killing."

<li> <A NAME="BP:3">After his squad was shot down at the Line,</A>
     Sinclair's ship was disabled and taken aboard a Minbari cruiser.
     He was tortured and examined, and at one point stood unfettered
     within the circle of the grey council itself.  When they didn't
     respond to his questions, Sinclair suddenly walked up to one of
     them and pulled back the hood, revealing the face of Delenn.  He
     was then knocked out again, and some time later returned to his
     ship with no memory of the experience.<br> 
     <I>(A <A HREF="008.line.synop.html">synopsis</A> of the
     events at the Line as Sinclair re-experiences them is available.
     There is also
     a separate <A HREF="008.line.page.html">Guide page</A> devoted to those
     events.)</I>

<li> <A NAME="BP:4"><B>Knight Two:</B></A> "Your ship was off the
     screens for 24 hours.  You didn't just black out, your ship
     disappeared!"<br> 
     <B>Sinclair</B> "The screens malfunctioned, the hearing proved that."

<li> <A NAME="BP:5">This would explain</A> why Sinclair 
     "fell off the merry-go-round" promotion-wise.
     Officers who've inexplicably disappeared in the presence of the
     enemy tend to hit a glass ceiling even if their loyalty is
     officially accepted.

<li> <A NAME="BP:6">The Knights may be part of a covert operation</A>
     within Earth Force that's trying to find collusion between Earth
     officials and the Minbari.

</ul>

<H2><A NAME="UQ">Unanswered Questions</A></H2>

<ul>

<li> <A NAME="UQ:1">Franklin asks Delenn,</A> "How were you involved in
     the war?".  She declines to answer, even though he had just
     answered the same question from her.  Toward the end of the episode
     it's revealed that Delenn did indeed play a significant role in the
     war, but little is yet known about what that was.  
     (cf: <A HREF="020.html">"Babylon Squared"</A>)

<li> <A NAME="UQ:2">Sinclair's absence was first realized</A> when
     Delenn reported that he didn't show up for a meeting with her in
     the Council room.  What was that meeting to have been about?

<li> <A NAME="UQ:3">Delenn said she checked with Ivanova</A> before
     asked Garibaldi about Sinclair's absence.  Ivanova is willing to
     page Sinclair about <em>everyday</em> problems - why wouldn't she call his
     link when he's mysteriously long overdue for a diplomatic appointment?

<li> <A NAME="UQ:4">Later, Delenn asks Ivanova</A> if there's anything
     she can do to help, and Ivanova replies that the crew is doing
     everything possible.  Yet why is she strolling down a corridor with
     Delenn, rather than following leads and scouring for new ways to
     find Sinclair?

<li> <A NAME="UQ:5">How was Sinclair flawlessly abducted from his quarters?</A>

<li> <A NAME="UQ:6">How did Knight One get Benson's body off the station?</A>  
(see <A HREF="#JS:a">jms Speaks</A>)

<li> <A NAME="UQ:7">Who were the Knights working for?</A>

<li> <A NAME="UQ:8">Why wasn't telepathy used for the interrogation?</A>
     It would have been no less legal than what the Knights did, and a
     telepath would probably have had better skills at dredging up old
     memories.  The whole power source problem (which ultimately sunk
     the Knights' plan) could have been avoided - only the stimulation
     technology need have been brought on board.

<li> <A NAME="UQ:9">Is Sinclair really a Minbari plant?</A>

<li> <A NAME="UQ:10">Why was Delenn's superior on the station?</A>

<li> <B><A NAME="UQ:11">What is it</A> that the Minbari don't want
     Sinclair to remember about his experience on the Line???</B>

</ul>

<H2><A NAME="AN">Analysis</A></H2>

<ul>

<li> <A NAME="AN:1"><B>Sinclair:</B></A> "Everyone lies, Michael.  The
     innocent lie because they don't want to be blamed for something
     they didn't do, and the guilty lie because they don't have any
     other choice."<br> This is extra reason to think twice before
     taking anything said in this episode at face value.  Nor should one
     assume that a lie covers up wrongdoing.

<li> <A NAME="AN:2">Earth Force</A> was researching the use of genetic
     and biological warfare against the Minbari.  These are offensive,
     not defensive methods, effective only on planets.  They must have
     been planning a desperation ground strike of some kind.  
     (cf: <A HREF="002.html">"Soul Hunter"</A>)

<li> <A NAME="AN:3">After he punches Knight Two in VR,</A> Sinclair
     looks at his hand, making a fist and releasing it.  Scenes of him
     in the cybernet chair after that show him clenching his fist in
     real life as well, in unison with continued fist-clenching in VR.
     Sinclair is rediscovering, slowly, how to get his brain to control
     his body.  The pain of the remembered zap in the council chambers
     is later enough to propel him all the way back, if groggily.

<li> <A NAME="AN:4">While looking for Sinclair's body outside,</A>
     station forces discover the body of Benson floating outside Red
     Sector.  Garibaldi visually identifies him (other Security folks
     had not been able to), and says, "Whoever killed him couldn't have
     carried the body very far without being noticed."  He may be wrong
     in this conclusion - Knight One could have dumped it into a
     nondescript cart and gone a long way, for example.

<li> <A NAME="AN:5"><B>Garibaldi:</B></A> "If they dumped the body out
     of an airlock, the station's gravity wouldn't let it get far."
     This is true <em>only</em> if the body was dumped out of a no- or
     low-velocity airlock.  Perhaps Garibaldi's assertion is correct
     because there aren't any high-velocity airlocks on the station
     other than the Cobra Bays.

<li> <A NAME="AN:6"><B>Knight Two:</B></A> "Look at Earth: Alien
     civilization.  Alien migration.  Aliens buying up real estate by
     the square mile.  What they couldn't take by force, they corrupted!
     Inch by inch!"<br> This sounds very much like Homeguard propaganda
     - perhaps there is a connection.  (cf: <A HREF="007.html">"War
     Prayer"</A>)

<li> <A NAME="AN:7">Delenn exhibits ignorance</A> of the powers of Earth
     telepaths - Ivanova had to explain to her that Talia, a P5, was not
     capable of a search-and-recover mission.

<li> <A NAME="AN:8">Ivanova's only contribution to the search effort</A>
     was to track all ships that left Babylon 5 in the previous 8 hours,
     which turned out to be wasted effort.  This and several 
     <A HREF="#UQ:3">Unanswered Questions</A> suggest she may have been
     working with the Knights.

<li> <A NAME="AN:9"><B>Delenn:</B> "It's me, commander."</A><br>
     <B>Sinclair:</B> "I know - I know you.  I know who you are."<br>
     <B>Delenn:</B> "I'm your friend, commander.  Ambassador Delenn.  
     <em>Your friend.</em><br>
     <B>Sinclair:</B> "NO!  I know you.  I know you."  
     [Knight One prepares to fire, Sinclair shoots him down]<br>
     <B>Delenn:</B> "Welcome home."<br>
     [Sinclair collapses]<br>
     By his emphatic denial above, it should be clear to Delenn that
     Sinclair is remembering <em>something</em> about 
     <A HREF="008.line.synop.html#GC:2">his discovery of her at the
     Line.</A> He later denies remembering anything, but she must wonder
     if he's lying.  (If the <A HREF="008.line.page.html#AN:5">Analysis</A> 
     in the Line Guide page is correct, however, she should be
     <B>certain</B> he is lying.)

<li> <A NAME="AN:10">Knight Two apparently remembered nothing</A> about
     himself after Sinclair's destructive escape fried his memory.
     However, the word "Commander" brings him up short, and he remembers
     Sinclair's name, saying "There's something in my head.  It says:
     'Maybe you're still inside.  Maybe we're both still inside.'"  His
     phrasing there indicates that this is not his own current thought,
     but a thought that survived his brain damage.  So, what did Knight
     Two, in full possession of his faculties, mean by that suspicion?
     The most obvious answer is "inside the simulation", but this is a
     very weak explanation, and goes nowhere.

<li> <A NAME="AN:11">Knight Two's last experience</A> would have been
     watching Sinclair's recollection of his Grey Council experience,
     <B>including</B> his discovery of Delenn (whom Knight Two may not
     have recognized).
     
<li> See also the <A HREF="008.line.page.html">Guide page</A> devoted to
     Sinclair's recollection of the events on the Line.

<p>
<li> Absolutely unlike anything ever produced before for television.
	Directorially, and in terms of the visual effects, the CGI, the
	performances, right across the board, it's a stunner. And just...I
	can't convey this enough...different. It just takes TV SF and yanks it
	to a whole other level of complexity.

<p>
<li> As for a production report...things are going swimmingly. Today we started
     getting dailies on our first day of shooting on "And the Sky Full of
     Stars," which deals with the Battle of the Line. This is not going to
     look like your conventional episode of television. We've brought in
     equipment that you don't normally see on a television set, certain kinds
     of cranes and lenses and lighting packages that will give this
     particular episode a very strange, almost surreal look. It's quite
     remarkable.
     
     <p>
     And Ron's pushing the envelope on the CGI...compositing some
     live action stuff with CGI that'll blow your TV out.
     
     <p>
     It's going *well*.

<p>
<li> Spent a very, very, very long day today in editing...not out of any
     problems, but because of the *astonishing* amount of detail we're 
     putting into "And the Sky Full of Stars."  Leaving out all the live-
     action shots, there are 25 CGI shots in one and a half minutes in 
     one sequence alone.   (By way of comparison, there were 55 or so in
     the full two hour pilot for B5.)  So we go frame by frame, making 
     sure that everything meshes properly, through some pretty intense 
     gistics.  You'll understand when you see it.

     <p>
     I've never seen the like of this particular episode before.  It's a
     real gem. 

<p>
<li> On returns... Garibaldi's aide: yes.  Knights: yes, but not
     identified as such.

<p>
<li> Lurkers is indeed a net reference.

<p>
<li> Psi Corps, as a government-regulated agency, is prohibited from
     endorsing candidates or taking a political stance.

<p>
<li> I would *never* pull a "he wakes up and it was all a dream" on the
     series.  I hate that kind of story.

<p>
<li> <A NAME="JS:a">It has *always* been my sense</A> that the body was
     slipped out an access airlock in the zero-g cargo area.  Every
     other access -- like the boarding area and standard cargo area --
     is under close security to prevent this kind of thing, or the
     influx of contraband.  There's really nowhere to GO from the zero-g
     section, so it's a little looser.  As for how he got the body
     there...there is an answer, and a reason, and if you look at this
     episode again after the season is over, even the nitpickers who
     brought it up will be able to figure it out.  I didn't address it
     in the issue because I didn't think anyone would make a federal
     case out of this, and for other reasons that will in time become
     apparent.  Several other nits picked at this episode will *also* be
     clarified by season's end.  It's not easy to sit quietly, knowing
     the answer, and being unable to tell it, but that's simply what I
     have to do for the time being.

<p>
<li>
Psi Cops are *authorized* to carry firearms.  The Knights had an in
with Security, and by virtue of high government contacts, got their 
stuff on board.  Those seem to me not requiring much explanation.

<p>
<li>
I can't believe this "explain how the guns get aboard" discussion is
still going on.  This isn't the Enterprise, to use the cited example,
which is a *military vessel*, and only the occasional rare civilian 
gets on board. There are a QUARTER MILLION PEOPLE on board at any
given moment.  (People = humans and aliens.)  Not staying there, but
in a state of flux.  Going and coming.  Anywhere from 50 to 100 ships
per day dock at B5.  Thousands upon thousands of boxes, crates, cargo
loads, pallets, you name it.  If you stopped and inspected every 
single box that came through, the system would grind to a halt.  So
you do the best you can, you catch whatever you can, scan as much as
possible, and accept that some stuff is bound to slip through.
<p>
Further, this is the kind of explanation that has nothing to do with 
a story, only with someone's need to have something explained to them.
I think the time is spent better elsewhere.

<p>
<li> Yes, that is a triluminary on the grey council staff in "Sky."
     (cf. <a href="020.html">"Babylon Squared"</a>)

<p>
<li> Bear in mind, though, that Sinclair really had no reason to doubt what he
     remembered happening on the Line until the Minbari assassin uttered those
     seven fateful words. As for others...there have been suspicions, but more
     broadbased...and we'll deal with those a bit here and there.

<p>
<li> Also, check the readout on Sinclair's screen as he's trying to engage the
     enemy. You'll see "negative lock" popping up. One problem in fighting the
     Minbari vessels is that they have a kind of stealth tech that makes it very
     hard for our weapons to lock on.

<p>
<li>
Bill Mitchell from "Sky" is a reference to General Billy Mitchell . . .

<p>
<li> Yeah, it was an off-the-cuff reference to Billy Mitchell . . . 
     <p>
     (Didn't really mean that much; just thought it wuz cool.)

<p>
<li>
Re: "Sky"...my theory is to *never* assume prior knowledge of the
background info that goes into an episode.  If you never saw the 
pilot, you will miss *nothing* going into "Sky" (though it'd be nice
because of one quickie flashback to know where that came from).  I 
don't think anyone will have a hard time following that one.

<P>
<li>
This was one segment of the battle; there were others going on in 
other areas as well.  It's said that no one ever *saw* the Battle of
the Bulge; each saw a small part of it.  Same here.

<p>
Reality is, no matter how big we would've made it, more would've been
wanted.  (If anything, it seems that the more we show, the more is 
wanted.)  But all things considered, best to have folks wanting more
than wanting less....

<p>
(And remember, we're managing to do all this with roughly *half* of
TNG's budget.  Give us their budget, and I'll show you ALL of the 
Battle of the Line, and the ENTIRE Earth/Minbari War, PLUS all their
home worlds.)

<p>
Nonetheless, as we go deeper into the season, the CGI/action sequences
do get bigger and more detailed in many places.  In "Signs and 
Portents" (formerly "Raiding Party"), you'll see three pretty good
sized squadrons of ships engaged in a very fast-paced battle that goes
on for most of an act and a half, as opposed to just a few scenes in
"Sky."  Big battles weren't really the *point* in "Sky," it was more
about his REACTIONS and his personal fate.  There were a number of 
action/battle shots we had on hand, but decided not to use because we
didn't want to dilute the *point* of the scene.

<p>
And as stated elsewhere...yes, you'll be seeing the Minbari war
cruiser(s) again.

<p>
<li>
Actually, as you'll see in "Sky," sometimes the Good Guys *do* get
their ships hit; sometimes they blow up and kill the person (as you
will see), and sometimes they do damage without destroying the ship,
in which case there is an eject mechanism that separates the cockpit
part from the rest of the fighter, which contains the volatile 
reactors.

<p>
So in those circumstances, a flight suit is a *very* good idea....

<p>
<li>
We actually had a lot more shots we could've used to prolong the
sequence, but felt we *really* had to get to Sinclair, and go into 
his point of view more.  Also we step-printed the CGI to give it a 
more dream-like appearance, since we're seeing this from inside 
Sinclair's memory, and he wasn't really able to *see* all this,
particularly stuff happening around and behind him, this is more his
*sense* of the events of that time.  The sections we didn't step-print
were those where he was RIGHT THERE, to make a subtle distinction.

<p>
<li>
What?  Who, me?  Near as I remember, the Question was, "What happened
at the Battle of the Line?"  Answer: Sinclair was taken aboard the 
Minbari cruiser, tortured, interrogated, mind-wiped and shoved back
into his ship.

<p>
The Question *now* is, "WHY was Sinclair taken aboard the Minbari
cruiser, tortured, interrogated, mind-wiped and shoved back into his
ship?"

<p>
That question was not asked heretofore...so how could it be still
unanswered?

<p>
<li>
A number of people have commented that they weren't much surprised by
Sinclair being taken aboard, because on the nets -- and this has ONLY
taken place on the nets -- this speculation has been bandied about 
for some time.  We now have ten zillion speculations on the reason 
*why*.  I will not comment on them one way or another (though I 
suppose I could point, without making the real comparison between
types of typists, to the idea that an infinte number of monkeys typing
on an infinite number of keyboards would eventually produce Hamlet 
simply by chance combination; sooner or later, something close to the
reality might be stumbled upon...and let me ask a simple question: 
what purpose does that serve?  It only lessens the enjoyment of those
who would simply like to enjoy what happens WHEN it happens).

<p>
Any good detective knows that you can't really begin to speculate
about motive until you have all the information right at hand.  At 
this point there is information you don't have...and absent that, any
guesses will either be wrong, or close enough to hinder the fun but
still essentially incorrect.  It's like trying to guess the contents
of a box without knowing the size of the box...it could be a marble,
it could be an elephant or a pre-fabricated house.

<p>
All I'm suggesting is that you consider not trying to come up with
every possible angle, and let the show progress on its own.  Right 
now everybody seems to be scrambling to make sure every even remotely
feasible possibility is covered, and there an infinite number.  As an
organized activity, this will in time only prove frustrating.  By the
end of the season, as with being near the end of a movie, you'll have
enough info on hand to start making some educated guesses.  To do so
now is to begin the proess of calling out possible endings during
the first five minutes of a movie...you'll miss the important things,
and annoy the people sitting behind you.

<p>
I'm not saying stop; I'm just saying...relax, a little, I guess, and
simply be aware that you *cannot* scatter-shot this thing without 
having access to all the information.  It's like trying to guess the
beginnings of World War One without knowing *any* of the background of
the countries involved.  Suffice to say that the reason would not be
simplistic, or cliched, or *easily deduced*.  One thing I learned in
two years on "Murder, She Wrote" was to come up with a fairly complex
mystery, something that can't be easily solved going in, but which
makes perfect sense after you have all the facts and know which clues
were the real ones, and which were simply red herrings.

<p>
Just a thought....

<p>
<li>
We'd initially offered Walter [Koenig] the role of Knight Two in 
"Sky," but when his health prohibited using him, we went to Patrick
McGoohan, who loved the script, wanted to do it, but was going to be
out of the country at the time of shooting.  We then shifted Walter
to "Mind War."

<p>
<li>
Thanks.  I love Patrick's work.  Problem is he's *very* fussy on the
roles he takes.  (And justifiably so.)  He has to be sold on the 
script or there's no deal.  We'd sent him a copy of "And the Sky Full
of Stars," which would have had him as the main interrogator, Knight
Two...and he liked it, and was prepared to do it...when we checked our
respective calendars and discovered that he was going to be out of the
country when we were scheduled to shoot.
<p>
We hope to get him at some later time.  He's just terrific.

<p>
<li>
The CGI scenes were deliberately step-printed to give the shots a
more dreamlike look.

<p>
<li>
The CGI won't look as good in slow motion because we step-printed
them deliberately, in order to give them a more dream-like appearance.
For us, this wasn't about the ships, it was about one of the men in
the ship, which is why we kept him in sharp focus, and went to step-
printing whenever we went outside (and since we're seeing this from 
his memory, clearly he wouldn't actually have *seen* most ofthis, 
it's his *sense* of what happened).  You'll get plenty of clear CGI
in "Signs and Portents," airing in May.

<p>
<li>
Actually, there's a second shot in which you can see a body being 
thrown out; it's between Mitchell and Sinclair being hit.  Remember
that the body is strapped in in an angular fashion, and look for it
as it blows (as I recall) from left to right.  It's there.

<p>
<li>
This weekend, I was at the Space Frontier Foundation to receive an
award for Babylon 5 for Best Vision of the Future, part of which was
its recognition of our *deliberate efforts* to get things right.
Zero-G maneuvering, civilian use of space, a working O'Neill station,
on and on, all the stuff you think  happens by "coincidence."  And 
which has not generally HAPPENED on TV before.  In attendence were 
the Delta Clipper team of engineers, astronaut Pete Conrad, leading
researchers with NASA, JPL, McDonnell-Douglas, you name it.

<p>
And one of the people there, who had been with SDI and the Space
Program for 12 years, currently a top-level NASA consultant, pulled
me  aside and said that after seeing the line about the gravity not
letting the body get very far . . . he said he sat down to do the 
math required to come up with the actual MASS of B5, starting with
the 2.5 million tons of actual structure, plus likely vegetation, 
quarters, occupants, ships docked inside...and when you add it all
up, it came to about the same mass as a fairly small moon...and IT 
WOULD BE ENOUGH TO KEEP THE BODY FROM -- AS STATED IN THE SCRIPT -- 
GETTING VERY FAR.

<p>
The body would drift from the station a bit, get pulled back, hit
the hull, bounce, drift a bit, and be pulled back.  Or go into a slow
elliptical orbit.  (He mentioned that in the history of the Apollo
program, little bits of debris that would flake off the outside of
the ship would remain in proximity to the ship, just on the basis of
ITS mass and gravity, and it's not very big.)

<p>
A couple of other high-level engineers backed him up, and said that
it was quite reasonable.

<p>
<li>
The 2.5 million tons of spinning *metal* refers only to that part,
the metal casing.  It doesn't include the furniture, the structures,
the Garden, the 250,000 humans and aliens...so the total mass of the
thing is MUCH greater than the 2.5 megatons.  Also, the body was 
shoved out of the area around the cargo bay, non-rotating, which 
would also cut down on the momentum (as opposed to shoving out out of
the rotating part, where it would speed away at 1g).

<p>
<li>
Yes, it was always my assumption that the body was dumped out through
the zero-g section, since that has more traffic with cargo loaders 
and unloaders and less security than the passenger-oriented bays and
airlocks.

<p>
<li>
There is a security problem on B5, yes.  And we hope to deal with it
at some point.  It's inevitable, really; 250,000 residents, huge 
crates being moved in and out every day, people going and coming...
they try to confiscate what they can, but a lot slips through.

<p>
<li>
The second shot to Knight One is a gut-shot, and the security guard
is shot through the chest.

<p>
Bear in mind, also, that some of this may be expected by folks here
on the nets because of the ongoing conversations, speculation and the
bits of info I drop here; but for 99.9% of the rest of the nation,
this IS new info.  And even with the nets, I suspect that there are
some surprises here....

<p>
<li>
<em>'Universe Today' Headline</em><br>
I lived in San Diego from 1974-1981, and it's actually a great place,
so I'm inclined to tweak it once in a while, just for funsies....

<p>
<li>
The wisp of smoke is a wisp of smoke, nothing more important than that.
If something living in hyperspace bothers you...good, it
should.  The Psi Corps article is in frame for a reason.  Yes, we
sometimes put additional or important information in the background,
but I don't think we can be fair and assume that everyone sees it, so
if you don't see it in one place, it's stated out loud later on...the
background stuff is to give the alert viewer a fighting chance to 
guess some stuff BEFORE it happens; when stuff DOES finally happen,
all the required information is supplied at that time.

<p>
<li>
Correct, Gregory.  One of the things we learned from the pilot was
that we shoved too much information at people too fast.  So I
deliberately held back a lot of arc stuff in the beginning of the
series, allowing people to move gradually into the B5 universe, learn
more about it, and THEN start whapping them with the arc.  It isn't
until "Mind War" and "Sky" that we really begin cranking the arc.
