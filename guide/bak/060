   <li> <em>November 30, 1995</em> -
	As I write this, I've just started
	writing "War Without End, Part One," #316, the first part of the two
	episodes that bring Sinclair to Babylon 5, which we'll shoot sometime
	after the first of the year.  It's been touch and go, but we've finally
	been able to schedule all of the guest cast members from "Babylon
	Squared" for this one, which is the flip side of that episode.  It's
	probably going to be the most expensive show we've done yet, due to
	the hideous production requirements for this one.  It's also the one
	I'm most nervous about writing, even more than "Fall of Night,"
	because an awful lot happens here, and it has to be done just right.
	It's going to be probably the toughest writing job of the series to
	date.

	<p>
	I'll be putting Sinclair and Sheridan together a lot, which is
	shaping up to be an interesting combination.  We're also going to see
	Minbar for the first time.

<p>
   <li> Actually, Mike Vejar is directing the two-parter, and I'm
	absolutely thrilled about  it; Mike's been our mainstay for
	some time, and he's just terrific.  (He directed  "Convictions,"
	and "Inquisitor.")

<p>
   <li> Well, reactions have been coming in on the two parter, and so far
	everyone's wog-boggled.  Peter Jurasik called to say he didn't know
	what I'm smoking these days, but to please send ten pounds of it to
	his house at *once*.  Mumy went nuts over it, everyone's very
	excited...including and especially Michael O'Hare, who got his copy
	of the script today, read it straight through, and is *extremely*
	excited by the story, and what happens with his character, and is
	VERY much looking forward to the shoot.

<p>
   <li> (Oh, and lest I forget, yes, Zathras does return in "War," as does
	Sinclair, who has a lot of great scenes with Marcus, Sheridan, Delenn,
	Zathras and others.  It also has some real surprises in store, including
	some flash-forwards from WAY down the line.)

<p>
   <li> <em>January 22, 1996</em><br>
	Today was a very interesting day; today Michael O'Hare returned to the
	Babylon 5 stages in preparation for shooting the two-parter, which
	begins tomorrow.  Today he came by for his wardrobe fitting and to get
	his hair trimmed, say hi to folks, and hang out...lunch was me, John
	Copeland, Michael and Bruce Boxleitner eating together at one of the
	tables in the lunch area behind the stage, lots of laughing and kidding,
	and the two get on great. (Turns out they'd worked on other projects
	before, including the short-lived A Rumor of War series by Sterling
	Siliphant.)  

	<p>
	Anyway, it's a great atmosphere, and everybody's psyched for the
	two-parter.  It's like he never went away.

<p>
   <li> <em>January 23, 1996</em><br>
	[...] today is Michael O'Hare's first day of shooting here on
	the B5 stages for the two-parter, featuring his return to the station
	from Minbar, and propels him into the center of attention for most of
	the two parts. Everyone's having a great time so far, he and Bruce have
	been hanging out a lot, and the episode should be a real toad-strangler
	when it's finished.

<p>
   <li> A toad-strangler, a barn-burner, a doozy...it's a good thing.

<p>
   <li> <em>Won't Sheridan and Sinclair both be standing around giving orders?
	</em><br>
	The similarity is only if
	you choose to define them by their narrow roles.  Their personalities
	are vastly different.  Also, Sinclair's been through a lot in the
	intervening couple of years, he's grown, he and Marcus would definitely
	have something of a relationship since he would've been there while
	Marcus was being trained, and so on.  And their roles in the story are
	very different.

<p>
   <li> <em>Will the relationship between Delenn and Sheridan cause problems
	with Sinclair?</em><br>
	Well, remember that we never defined what those feelings were between
	Sinclair and Delenn; she had a great deal of respect and admiration
	for him, yes.  And she had a fair measure of faith in him as well.
	Question is, what's the root of that?  We'll learn some of that in
	the two-parter.  As for Sinclair, he was mainly involved with Sakai.

<p>
   <li> My guess is that "War Without End" may well pass by
	<a href="031.html">"CoS"</a>
	as all time favorite...until the next one comes along.

<p>
   <li> <em>Did you reuse footage from
	<a href="020.html">"Babylon Squared?"</a></em><br>
	We did both; we reshot some scenes from B2, and used some footage
	directly from that episode.  Some pretty elegant matches, too, I think.

<p>
   <li> As Sinclair notes when he arrives at B5, his status as ambassador is
	pretty much gone after the coup.

</ul>
