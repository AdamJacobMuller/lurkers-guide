   <li> One rumor, unconfirmed (and unlikely to be confirmed; see below) is
	that the title of this episode is "Z'ha'dum."

   <li> I'm going to hold the title of 22 confidential as long as
	possible.

<p>
   <li> By the last few episodes, pretty much all of my cards are on
	the table. But by the last episode of this season, we find that the
	game we've assumed we've been playing ain't necessarily the game at
	all.  The show takes a fairly subversive direction, and of all the
	seasons so far, the one that follows, year four, represents the
	greatest writing challenge to make this actually work.

	<p>
	Which is another reason why it's important to get the B4
	storyline and several other threads out in the open, and clear the
	decks, because this is gonna take every bit of whatever talent I've got
	to pull off.

	<p>
	Year four is the point in the novel when you're just past the
	halfway mark; you know the reader thinks he or she has got the story
	sussed out. The reader knows all your tricks by now, or thinks he/she
	does.  You've been pulling doves out of your hat for 243 pages.

	<p>
	Now you'd damned well better be able to pull out an alligator.

<p>
   <li> <em>February 27, 1996</em><br>
	Well, it's done.  I have today turned in the first draft of
	script #22 for year three, which I suppose could be called a
	cliffhanger episode. This marks the first time in the 50+ year history
	of American television that one person has singlehandedly written an
	entire season of a series. (The closest record is Terry Nation, who
	wrote the 13-episode first season of Blake's 7.)

	<p>
	(I have no plans to do this next season, btw; this was
	necessary because of the substantive changes in the B5 universe this
	season.  Next season is a very different story...literally as well as
	figuratively.)

	<p>
	So far the film based on those 1,000+ pages represents some of
	our best work on Babylon 5.  There's some nifty stuff coming.

	<p>
	We are currently filming episode #18.  Four more after this,
	and we'll be finished shooting year three, as of April 9th.  Not long
	after, we should get the word on year four, probably by late
	April/early May.  But the writing is finished...and for the first time
	in 8 months, I will be able to go out, see a movie, play Wing
	Commander, find something that vaguely resembles a life.  This is where
	I now also become a director's worst nightmare: a writer-producer who's
	finished writing and finally has time to hang out on the set and give
	lots and lots of helpful advice.

	<p>
	It was a hideous task; two-thirds through I began to understand
	that there was a *reason* nobody's ever done this before...you'd have
	to be outta your ever-loving mind to even try.  But as with everything
	else on B5, if we don't know it's impossible, we just go ahead and do
	it.

	<p>
	The title, as stated elsewhere, is classified, though you may
	get a sense of what's coming in the two eps that precede it. 
	Regardless, the writing on year three is now complete.  Overall, I'm
	quite pleased, and I think by the time you hit this episode, you'll
	feel the same.

<p>
   <li> Well, there's what one would *prefer*, and there's that which is
	*sensible*.  And the sensible answer is that no, once the last S3
	episode airs in the UK, there's no way on earth you're gonna keep that
	out of the public eye, and there ain't much sense to protecting it or
	hitting it with spoiler regs.  I'd let it go at that point.  

	<p>
	(And, frankly, it'll probably slip out some time before that; when it
	hits, it hits, I've decided to let it go at that point...you just ain't
	gonna hear it from ME, that's all.)

<p>
   <li> "Or is it a matter of the title being a spoiler for an episode between
	now and then?"

	<p>
	Yes, that's my concern.

	<p>
	While I'm on the subject, an advisory: I gave a short interview to
	Entertainment Weekly the other day for their story about cliffhanger
	endings for various shows.  Now, the piece is going to run in May since
	that's when most shows (most *sensible* shows) will be doing their
	cliffhangers.  Ours won't run until July or October, depending on who
	you talk to.  

	<p>
	There's a point where you have to decide between publicity (good for
	show) and secrecy (good for viewers), in the process of keeping the show
	on the air (also good for viewers).  So I let a few things out of the
	bag.  If you don't want to be spoiled, then you may want to avoid
	picking up and reading that story.

<p>
   <li> <em>Why a cliffhanger, if WB is likely to delay the final episode
	until the start of season four?</em><br>
	Because the story calls for it.  Whether they show the cliffhanger three
	months or two weeks before the fourth season (assuming renewal), this is
	where the story goes.  It was constructed like a series of novels, a
	multi-volume saga, and like any good series of novels, you end on
	something big.

	<p>
	And this year, season three ends on something really honking big.

</ul>
