<h2><a name="BP">Backplot</a></h2>
<ul>

   <li> G'Kar has been using a human courier to get messages back and forth
	between the station's Narn and the homeworld.

   <li> The first Earth vessel to encounter a Minbari warship was the
	Prometheus.
	As the Minbari ship approached with gun ports open, a sign of respect
	(<a href="017.html">"Legacies"</a>)
	the Prometheus' captain ordered its crew to open fire.  The resulting
	battle destroyed two Minbari warships and killed the leader of the
	Grey Council, Dukhat.

   <li> 20,000 people were sent to defend Earth in the Battle of the Line.
	Only 200 survived.  (Presumably the bulk of the 20,000 were aboard
	large ships, not individual fighters.)

</ul>

<h2><a name="UQ">Unanswered Questions</a></h2>
<ul>

   <li> Given how badly outmatched humans were during the war, how did the
	Prometheus manage to inflict so much damage?  Simply a matter of the
	element of surprise?

   <li> How much truth is there in Marcus' joking speculation about the
	Vorlons?  Or in his drawing of parallels between the B5 crew and
	Arthurian legend?  (If there's a lot of truth there, then who
	<em>is</em> the Morgana Le Fay figure?)

   <li> What is the "dawn of a new age" Marcus referred to when he told
	Franklin about the Ranger pin?  Any relation to the Third Age of
	Mankind as mentioned in the opening monologues of seasons one and
	two?

</ul>

<h2><a name="AN">Analysis</a></h2>
<ul>

   <li> Relying on a large number of races for the station's defense may turn
	out to be a logistical nightmare.  Ivanova will have to deal with
	questions like the structure of the chain of command (does she have
	the authority to order a Vree ship to fire?) and what to do about
	races who've agreed to participate but whose enemies haven't, which
	could lead to a situation like the one in
	<a href="044.html">"The Fall of Night."</a>
	Still, as a simple show of force and a deterrent, the arrangement may
	well end up being sufficient.

   <li> How did Marcus know about the events in
	<a href="043.html">"Comes the Inquisitor?"</a>
	He arrived on the station after that was all over.  Perhaps Sheridan
	or Delenn told him.  Is the fact that the Vorlons have visited Earth
	in the past now common knowledge?

   <li> The Prometheus didn't destroy all the Minbari ships, since Delenn
	held Dukhat in her arms as he died
	(<a href="054.html">"Severed Dreams."</a>)

   <li> At what point did the Soul Hunter
	(<a href="002.html">"Soul Hunter"</a>)
	show up during the battle between the Prometheus and the Minbari ships?
	From Arthur's description, it sounded like the battle didn't last
	long; the Soul Hunter would almost have had to be onboard Dukhat's
	ship before the fighting began.

   <li> The Drazi ambassador now speaks for the League of Non-Aligned Worlds,
	whose membership seems to have gotten much smaller than a year ago.
	Perhaps many of the races have been taken over by their neighbors
	already, with Shadow help
	(<a href="054.html">"Severed Dreams."</a>)

   <li> Michael York is currently shooting with us in "A Late Delivery From
	Avalon," and doing an amazing job.  This may turn into one of our best
	episodes, from a performance and emotion perspective.  I had a few
	doubts about the script -- it has a kind of writing style I don't use
	very often, and very stylized in appearance -- but it's coming out
	great.

<p>
   <li> York finished with us quite some time ago.  Great episode, and a nice
	man.  Very friendly, very polite, nothing of the "I'm a STAR"
	attitude one often gets with...well, *stars*.  He was even very nice
	when I gleepily asked him to sign my laserdisk of CABARET.

<p>
   <li> York's a major film actor who's starred in many films,
	including one of my personal favorites, "Cabaret."  Also in the
	"Logan's Run" movie.

<p>
   <li> I *really* like this episode a lot.  The performance,
	the music, everything works; I tried to get a little artsy, try out
	some different kinds of stuff, stretch some muscles I haven't used
	enough, and it came out very nicely.  It's just nifty.

<p>
   <li> I like this one a lot.  Not really an arc episode,
	except in going into some backstory elements, but just nicely done. 
	I'm quite proud of this one.

<p>
   <li> The Delenn/Arthur moment played out very well; no
	lines, not a word, just the images, and the emotions under the surface.

<p>
   <li> <em>About the title</em><br>
	I often labor a long time on these
	things, to try and give them many layers, or turn the title in on
	itself, or do a play on words.  I can't start work on a script until I
	have a title, because the title sets the mood.

<p>
   <li> <em>Did Arthurian legends influence the heroic-epic style of B5's
	storyline?</em><br>
	Well, if you're going to look at heroic epic, sure, the
	Arthurian story is a classic...but the earliest and best of these
	remain the Illiad and the Odyssey.  Homer was definitely hitting all
	cylinders with that.

	<p>
	If there's an aspect that informed B5's development, it's the
	arc of that heroic epic, which if you look at it dispassionately, is as
	much about the people *around* the hero as the hero himself.  And all
	too often, the hero achieves the goal, but falls or falters or is
	changed by the end of it. Much of what passes for contemporary "heroic
	epic" assumes that it means the Good Guys Win.  Heroic here as a term
	goes back to its much earlier origins, a "heroic effort" is something
	that takes everything you have, against terrible or impossible odds.

	<p>
	Yes, you achieve the goal...but you fall in battle in the
	fields of Troy.  Yes, you create Camelot, but in the end you are
	destroyed and Camelot falls.  There's tragedy and mistakes side by side
	with the glory and the gains.  The accounts of Arthur's meeting with
	Mordred at Camlan field, and how the final battle began is classic
	ironic drama, a tragedy of great proportions...and an aspect of that
	fed directly into the development of the B5 backstory, as you'll learn
	later this season.

	<p>
	Histories are written about the soldiers who won their battles;
	but songs are sung about the soldiers who fell in battle struggling for
	a greater cause.  What inspires us is the unfinished work, the dream of
	picking up the fallen standard and taking it ten more feet up the hill,
	knowing that even if you fall, the next man in line will take it
	another ten feet, until finally the hill is taken.  Humans are
	constantly throwing their lives away on causes logic tells us are
	hopeless...but which in time become real for that reason.

	<p>
	It's a dangerous romance with myth, heroism, and death.  On the
	one hand, it inspires an Arthur...on another, it inspires a car bomber
	to blow himself and 27 bystanders to bits en route to an appointment
	with Allah.

	<p>
	What makes the heroic epic work is that it taps into all the
	myths and archetypes that have been with us for all of recorded
	history, and much of its oral history.  Where B5 gets into this area is
	in trying to look at the kinds of myths and epics that have gone
	before, and finding not the specifics, but the themes which are
	universal, the *sense* and the feel of it, which are intangible, and
	which is what makes doing an epic so hard. Either you feel the 
	structure, or you don't; if you try to hammer it down into a formula,
	a step-by-step process, it turns to quicksilver in your hands and slips
	away. You have to take it all in, then listen to the inner voice and
	write accordingly.

	<p>
	I remember a stanza from a poem I read a long time ago; "Love
	will die if held too tightly; love will fly if held too lightly;
	lightly, tightly, how do I know, whether I'm holding or letting love
	go?"  This kind of fiction operates on the same basis.  Substitute the
	word epic or story for love, and the logic holds.

	<p>
	So the epic hero or story can't be a *model*, to use your
	phrase; it can only be an inspiration for what has gone before...an
	echo in the back of your mind that whispers and guides you through all
	the dark places.

<p>
   <li> <em>Where did the 515 date for the Battle of Camlan come from?</em><br>
	I dug through a number of recent Arthurian texts, and that date come out
	the most often; I've heard the other date, which was about 20 years
	later, but the one most often used is the 515 date, at least in what
	I researched.  

<p>
   <li> <em>Was the Excalibur in the episode a real sword?</em><br>
	Yes, it's a real sword...I'm trying to remember where we got it,
	it may have been a vendor in these things, one of many that frequent
	catalogs and Ren faires.

<p>
   <li> <em>Was some of the music by Clannad?</em><br>
	No, we can't use any outside music; it all has to be done via our
	composer (unless we purchase the rights, obviously).  Here, though, it's
	all Chris.  We had a long conversation about the kind of music I wanted,
	I encouraged him to think in terms of Celtic music, natural
	instruments primarily instead of synth or electronic instruments, that
	sort of thing.  But no, no Claanad was used.

<p>
   <li> <em>How is the station supporting itself now that it's seceded?</em><br>
	We'll establish in coming episodes that they have to become more
	self sufficient; the Minbari will help some, others will also have a
	reason to help support the station for the advantages it gives them,
	the services it provides, and eventually docking fees will have to rise
	if they can make a go of it.

<p>
   <li> Marcus and Franklin make a good team, it's a
	nice balance.  And Marcus did fit in well with the whole Arthur
	storyline (it's kind of an obvious but well-fitting match).

	<p>
	As for Marcus' line...sometimes offhand remarks are only offhand
	remarks...and sometimes they aint....

<p>
   <li> Because we've played back and forth with this
	stuff before, a la the Inquisitor, it *could've* been him, which made
	it all the more interesting.  Certainly Marcus *wanted* it to be
	him....

<p>
   <li> You basically had two large convoys meeting one another.  Two Minbari
	ships were hit and destroyed, a third damaged badly; this was the one
	carrying Dukhat and the Grey Council, including Delenn.  

	<p>
	Just for the record, what happened after that...the Minbari ships opened
	fire, and a number of the Earth ships were fragged.  The rest fled as
	the Minbari ships hesitated, waiting to see what happened to Dukhat. 
	When it
	was learned that he was killed, they took off and pursued the ships back
	to an Earth base.  Initially, one of the Earth captains explained that
	they had encountered hostiles (trying to cover his ass), and when the
	Minbari ships appeared, all hell broke loose.

	<p>
	It was shortly after this "cowardly attack" on their ships, and the
	assassination of their leader, that the Minbari declared what is in
	essence a jihad, a holy war, against Earth.  The worker class went along
	with it, even though the religious caste was unsure...but divided, they
	couldn't raise sufficient objections to the war to stop it initially.

<p>
   <Li> The contact was made late in the year, and while that was the
	first blow, it takes a while for any war to really get going; you
	aren't at war instantly.  The Minbari had to pull their forces
	together, make the open declaration of war, establish supply lines and
	all the other elements needed for warfare.

<p>
   <li> There's a small clue about the third age in the discussion
	between Marcus and Franklin about the ranger pin.  I mean, it's really
	pretty blatant.

<p>
   <li> The name of the Ranger pin is spelled Isil'zha.
	
	<p>
	The Minbari term for Ranger One, btw, is Entil'zha.

	<p>
	Z'ha'dum is where the shadows live.  Odd, that reversal....
