   <li> YAAAAAAGGGGHHHHH.....

	<p>
	Well, I *finally* finished writing the two-parter, "War Without End,"
	which is probably the toughest thing I've written for the series to
	date.  Given everything that has to fit in here, and the fact that
	it's the other half of the B4 storyline (this ain't a spoiler,
	that'll be common knowledge in ads and the like), it became a pretty
	difficult job, moreso than when I'd originally thunk it up.  It's
	kinda like cramming 20 pounds of potatoes in a 10 pound bag...but I
	*think* I got it all in, even though the initial drafts came out at
	about 7 pages too long.  As I commented to one person, "I'm
	definitely dancing on the edge of my ability here."  But I'm pretty
	sure I pulled it all off...and I think folks are going to be quite
	pleased.

	<p>
	But *man* that was tough....

	<p>
	Now, having written 16 and 17, only 5 scripts remain to be written
	for this season.  And there's still an awful lot to fit in before the
	big season ender, which I suspect will raise quite a few eyebrows.

<p>
   <li> In my last general posting to rastb5, I mentioned that from time to
	time, I'd try to post the occasional "letter to home" just to keep folks
	up to date on matters Babylonian.  Now that I can catch a breather, I
	figured I'd take this opportunity to do so (though since it's 3:15 a.m.,
	this'll likely be short).

	<p>
	"catching a breather" refers to the script situation.  I've just
	finished writing 316 and 317, the two parter, "War Without End,"
	which was a very difficult task, given the amount of story and
	logistics that had to be put into it.  While writing "Babylon
	Squared," to which this is the flip-side, I figured, "Oh, sure, yeah,
	I can get this all in on the other side, no problem," but when it
	came time to do it, it got awful tight, but finally I fit it *all*
	in.  (Well, all except one teeny, tiny sentence, about where Zathras
	was first seen, and how, 'cause to do what I'd first had in mind
	would've taken another 3 pages, and I didn't have that, so that one
	element I'll have to just deal with later somehow.  But that's it.)
	Hopefully, one need never have seen B2 in order to watch and follow
	WWE.  (Which was one of the hard parts, since B2 may or may not be
	aired prior to this, all the background information *had* to be in
	the episodes, so that's a lot of background to include.)

	<p>
	This now leaves 5 episodes to be written for this season.  At this
	point, Lyta should factor strongly in one or two of these, there will be
	some direct confrontations between our side and the shadows, then a
	really nasty final episode for year three.
