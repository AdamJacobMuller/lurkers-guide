<h2><a name="BP">Backplot</a></h2>
<ul>

   <li> Ivanova has been in the military for 13 years.

   <li> The Centauri are attempting to pacify the Narn homeworld's population.
	Among other techniques, they send troops to Narn villages to root out
	aggressive citizens and "put them to sleep."  Sometimes entire villages
	are found to be aggressive and are burned to the ground.

   <li> Vir, using his power as head of the diplomatic office on Minbar, has
	been running a Schindleresque underground railroad for Narns.  He
	created a fake persona in the Centauri government, "Abrahamo Linconi,"
	and faked death certificates for over two thousand Narn after "Linconi"
	ordered them transferred to work camps on Centauri Prime.

   <li> The Centauri consider marriage for the sake of love rather than politics
	a radical act.

   <li> Vir's uncle doesn't think highly of him, claiming that Vir is capable
	of "a well-deserved humility."

   <li> Vir has an interest in human history.

</ul>

<h2><a name="UQ">Unanswered Questions</a></h2>
<ul>

   <li> How was Ivanova able to flesh out Vir's fake official, whose records
	were presumably in the Centauri Republic's private databases?

   <li> What did Vir and Lyndisty do with the bound Narn?  Obviously Vir didn't
	kill him, but what did he tell Lyndisty?

   <li> Will Lyndisty's family cancel the
	arrangements now that Vir has been demoted?

   <li> Does G'Kar know of Vir's efforts?  Will he be able to forgive Vir
	in spite of himself
	(<a href="043.html">"Comes the Inquisitor?"</a>)

</ul>

<h2><a name="AN">Analysis</a></h2>
<ul>

   <li> If Ivanova and Allen could follow the paper trail to discover that
	Vir apparently sent thousands of Narn to their deaths, others might
	be able to as well.  Vir may find himself a target if any
	Narn who aren't in on his secret manage to access the records in
	question.  Certainly Lyndisty is still in danger; lots of other Narn
	would undoubtedly like to get their hands on someone with her history.

   <li> Vir can still help the Narn if he chooses, though it'll be riskier.
	He presumably has retained his post as Londo's attache, which should
	have some authority in itself.  And by tempering Londo, however
	slightly, he may do more good than he did on Minbar.

   <li> Vir isn't alone in wanting to help the Narn; he referred to others
	working with him.  Will those others be able to continue, especially
	with Ivanova's assistance?  The presence of other Centauri might
	explain how she was able to access the Centauri government's files.

   <li> Given Londo's feelings about bugs, what will his reaction be when he
	sees an arachnoid Shadow warship for the first time?  Perhaps his
	fear of insects (and spiders) stems in part from his dream
	(<a href="045.html">"Matters of Honor."</a>)

   <li> There may also be a parallel between Londo's insect hunt and the
	typical Centauri attitude toward the Narn, who they regard as little
	more than bugs on two feet.  If that parallel is intentional, Londo's
	line about the insects "evolving before my eyes" might have some
	relation to the Narns' changing position in the universe -- with
	G'Kar's help (and some prodding from Kosh) they're becoming something
	quite different than they were mere months earlier.

   <li> Evidence of the pressures of independence are starting to appear:
	B5's officers now drink an unidentified liquid instead of morning
	coffee and the ambassador of a major race -- albeit an ally of the
	government the station opposes -- can't get a maintenance crew to
	his quarters.  The loss of Earth funding and support is likely to
	grow worse over time.

   <li> Vir's smuggled Narn are considered dead by the Centauri -- perhaps
	making one of them the subject of Lady Morella's prophecy to Londo,
	that he "must not kill the one who is already dead"
	(<a href="053.html">"Point of No Return."</a>)

</ul>

<h2><a name="NO">Notes</a></h2>
<ul>

   <li> The title is something of a pun; it's Latin for "thus passes the man"
	(roughly speaking.)  It's probably a reference to the saying "sic
	transit gloria mundi" ("thus passes the glory of the world.")

</ul>

<h2><a name="JS">jms speaks</a></h2>
<ul>

   <li> <em>Why were this episode and
	<a href="057.html">"A Late Delivery From Avalon"</a>
	swapped?</em><br>
	We flipped them around because after "Ceremonies" we NEED something
	lighter, and because York's episode in the new slot now coincides with
	the first week of sweeps.  They were written to play in either order.

<p>
   <li> <em>Can you tell us more about Vir's family?</em><br>
	I can, but I'd rather show it; you'll find out a lot more about Vir and
	family relations in "Sic Transit Vir" in mid-april.

<p>
   <li> Yes, it's sort of a double pun in that respect...thus passes
	the man, which can have many meanings, also entering manhood, or dying,
	or going away, or the more Vir transitioning, or going...lots of
	variations.

<p>
   <li> Just an advisory...I finally saw the trailer for "Sic Transit Vir," and
	I'd suggest anyone who wants to enjoy the show *not* watch the trailer,
	as it gives away stuff that shouldn't be given away.

	<p>
	I.e., if the trailer for The Maltese Falcon said, "...and see the
	surprise when the black bird is discovered to be an imitation."

<p>
   <li> <em>About Vir</em><br>
	He's a much stronger character than anyone
	might think.  He's sort of the "God's Fool" character, to get literary
	for a second, who somehow manages to make it through it all.

<p>
   <li> At this point, with the rethinking going on back home, he's
	bethrothed and promised, the marriage arranged, but not yet fully,
	*formally* married. There's still ritual to go through.  The other
	family could still choose to withdraw the arrangement.

<p>
   <li> Even the babble is pretty tightly scripted.  The hesitations and
	occasional stumble-restatements are the actor's delivery.  There's
	occasionally a very tiny bit of improv in that kind of scene, but very
	little.

<p>
   <li> Londo is a very sharp, cunning character.  He does what he
	does for sheer patriotism, to serve his people.  *Whatever* that may
	entail.  And Vir gets whipsawed a lot...he's a great character, with a
	wide range of characteristics I can play with, from comic to tragic.

<p>
   <li> When Londo goes to Delenn earlier this season to ask about having Vir
	appointed to the Centauri diplomatic mission, he mentions then that the
	mission has been closed for some time, "some trouble I believe with our
	previous liaison."  This just paid that off; those Minbari are just a
	darned bad influence, I guess.

<p>
   <li> <em>What happened to the Narn?  And what were the Narns doing in Vir's
	room?</em><br>
	I could've *sworn* there was a line there about the Narn
	recovering; I'm going to have to check this.  I hope I didn't
	accidentally cut it for time while doing something else.  (It was a
	LONG editing session.)

	<p>
	I figured the Narns were there to discuss the fates of their
	families back home, but yeah, to a certain degree it was there as a
	great end for the teaser.

<p>
   <li> <em>Who said the line that was cut?</em><br>
	It was in the observation dome scene with Ivanova; I realized
	that we'd cut a small piece for time that was expendable, but in the
	back and forth went one line too far without realizing it.  Sigh....

<p>
   <li> <em>What was the line?</em><br>
	The only line was that "the Narn is recovering in Medlab,"
	something to that effect.  Sigh....

<p>
   <li> <em>Did the Centauri politician know Vir's secret?</em><br>
	No, he didn't know, and would've been horrified if he had.

<p>
   <li> <em>What was the saucer-shaped ship outside the station?</em><br>
	It's a Vree ship, which we've seen before.

<p>
   <li> <em>About the patches on the sleeves of the new uniforms</em><br>
	One of the patches is a Ranger patch; the other is the new B5
	sword and shield logo.

<p>
   <li> It's been established that Minbari can and do lie when it's done to save
	the honor of another.  Here, Delenn saved face for Sheridan at dinner.

<p>
   <li> Londo and the bugs had nothing to do with any notions about the Shadows.

	<p>
	Sheridan is a war historian, with his main interests in the civil war,
	where one of his ancestors fought.  He's very big on Lincoln.
