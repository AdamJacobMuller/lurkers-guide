<h2><a name="BP">Plot Points</a></h2>
<ul>

<p>
   <li>@@@865841437 Clark's ship commanders have been convinced that if they
	surrender to Sheridan, they'll be killed and their crews replaced by
	Minbari.  Perceiving they have nothing to lose, they are therefore
	willing to fight the rebel forces to the death.

<p>
   <li>@@@865841437 Sheridan has been captured by Clark's forces.  Garibaldi
	personally sprung the trap, which earned him a commendation
	from ISN and condemnation from Ivanova: she has ordered B5's
	personnel to shoot him on sight.

<p>
   <li>@@@865843518 Ivanova is now in command of the rebel fleet, and has
	vowed to keep up the fight with or without Sheridan.

<p>
   <li>@@@865843518 Sheridan's old ship, the Agamemnon
	(<a href="023.html">"Points of Departure"</a>)
	has joined the rebel fleet.  (See
	<a href="#NO.aggie">Notes</a>)

<p>
   <li>@@@865841437 The telepath virus described by Wade and Lise in
	<a href="078.html">"Conflicts of Interest"</a>
	is indeed real, as is the drug to suppress it -- but the virus was
	developed by Edgars' company.  It is airborne, 100% contagious, and
	completely harmless to normals.  Telepaths have to take
	the cure every two weeks, or they'll die.  Edgars' plan was to release
	it on Earth and use control of the cure to effectively enslave all
	the telepaths, preventing them from ever gaining the upper hand
	over normals.  Bester believes the virus was developed with the help
	of the Shadows, who had a vested interest in wiping out telepaths.

<p>
   <li>@@@865841437 When Justin told Sheridan that the Shadows wouldn't kill
	him because someone else would come along and take his place
	(<a href="066.html">"Z'ha'dum"</a>)
	he had specific people in mind: Delenn, Ivanova and Garibaldi.  The
	Shadows decided that given his innate paranoia, Garibaldi would be
	easiest to cause to turn away from Sheridan's cause, thus sabotaging the
	Army of Light in Sheridan's absence.  The Psi Corps was given the
	assignment of programming Garibaldi.  They took him to a secret
	facility on Mars, where Bester intervened and added some programming
	of his own.

	<p>
	Bester was aware that some kind of action was being planned against the
	Corps, but he didn't know what or by whom.  Given Garibaldi's proven
	track record at ferreting out conspiracies, Bester instructed his
	colleagues to leave Garibaldi's personality largely intact, and to
	accentuate his natural sense of paranoia and distrust.  Garibaldi's
	resignation was an unexpected bonus that put him in a perfect position
	to infiltrate Edgars' organization.

	<p>
	Garibaldi's mission was to gather information about the threat to
	the Psi Corps if the opportunity arose, then signal Bester.

<p>
   <li>@@@865841437 Bester has removed Garibaldi's programming, leaving him
	with full memory of what was done to him and what he's done to
	Sheridan.

<p>
   <li>@@@865841437 Bester's people have murdered Edgars and Wade and may
	have taken the virus.  Lise's whereabouts are unknown.

<p>
   <li>@@@865841437 The Corps has engaged in clandestine operations in the
	past.  While Lyta was interning with the Psi Cops
	(<a href="041.html">"Divided Loyalties"</a>)
	someone started murdering telepaths.  The Corps engaged in illegal
	scans of civilians, and eventually found the killer.  Rather than
	simply kill him, they twisted his mind.  According to Lyta, he's
	now in a cell in a secret facility on Beta 2, straitjacketed 24
	hours a day to keep him from clawing out his own eyes to stop the
	nightmare visions only he can see.

<p>
   <li>@@@865843518 The Corps has gone even further with the establishment of
	"bloodhound units," special undercover detachments of the Earth
	military who are accompanied by telepaths.  Their mission is to
	perform random scans of the public and arrest any members of the
	resistance they come across.

<p>
   <li>@@@865841437 Lyta believes there's likely to be a war between telepaths
	and mundanes some day, when word of such operations gets out and
	the trust the Corps has managed to build up evaporates as a result.

</ul>

<h2><a name="UQ">Unanswered Questions</a></h2>
<ul>

   <li>@@@865841437 Where is Lise?

   <li>@@@871079445 What does Bester plan to do with the virus, assuming he
	has it?

   <li>@@@865843518 Does Franklin know the full extent of Sheridan's plans
	for the frozen telepaths, and can he carry them out with Sheridan
	out of the picture?

   <li>@@@866145360 Why didn't Franklin detect Garibaldi's false tooth during
	his medical exams?

   <li>@@@866271627 Now that Ivanova is leading the fleet, will she continue
	her Voice of the Resistance broadcasts?

   <li>@@@866347436 Is the Agamemnon's defection to the resistance what it
	seems?

</ul>

<h2><a name="AN">Analysis</a></h2>
<ul>

<p>
   <li>@@@865843518 The resolution of the battle between Sheridan and Clark's
	forces points out what may be Sheridan's most potent weapon against
	Clark: not White Stars or superior strategy, but the presence of
	previously loyal human commanders who lend credibility to the rebel
	cause.

<p>
   <li>@@@866949092 The White Stars appear to have adapted to Earth's weapons;
	a hit from an Earth heavy cruiser only disables a White Star until
	the auto-repair systems come online.  Even without the defection
	of so many Earth ships, Ivanova is in command of an unstoppable
	military force.

<p>
   <li>@@@866948931 Sheridan told the Agamemnon's captain that the rebel
	forces had lost some battles, but had kept the news to themselves.
	("We've lost a few.  We just made damned sure nobody heard about it.")
	How is that possible?  Wouldn't Clark jump at the chance to spread
	news of victory over Sheridan's forces?  And for that matter, would
	Ivanova participate in covering up any losses, given her insistence
	on telling the truth in her Voice of the Resistance broadcasts?
	(<a href="079.html">"Rumors, Bargains and Lies"</a>)

	<p>
	Perhaps Sheridan simply has a more specific definition of "victory"
	than most other people.  He didn't seem to consider the outcome of
	the Proxima 3 battle a victory
	(<a href="081.html">"No Surrender, No Retreat"</a>)
	so perhaps he'd consider it a loss if he wound up having to fight
	Clark's forces to the death.

	<p>
	Or maybe Sheridan wasn't referring to his current campaign, but was
	speaking in general of his military career.

<p>
   <li>@@@865843969 Sheridan demonstrated a lack of caution in this episode,
	first going over to the Agamemnon on a moment's notice (it could
	easily have been sent by Clark as a trap) then agreeing to go to
	Mars by himself.  He even walked straight into a public place without
	attempting to obscure his face, which has no doubt been featured daily
	on ISN.  That can be seen as evidence of what Garibaldi
	referred to as a "God complex" -- Sheridan appears to have disregarded
	his own fallibility.

	<p>
	It's possible that this stems in part from the glimpse of his own
	future in
	<a href="061.html">"War Without End, Part Two,"</a>
	which might lead Sheridan to believe that no matter what he does now,
	he'll be alive and free in 17 years.

<p>
   <li>@@@866618297 Sheridan's capture was similar to G'Kar's in
	<a href="068.html">"Whatever Happened to Mr. Garibaldi?"</a>
	Both of them left a place of relative safety to try to rescue someone
	they cared about, and both were captured by a regime that was
	oppressing their people.  Both were tortured after capture.

<p>
   <li>@@@866347436 The Agamemnon, according to its captain, had been
	modified to track Sheridan's forces down.  What, specifically, were
	the modifications?  And more importantly, how likely is it that Clark
	would equip a ship specifically to seek Sheridan out without being
	very sure of its loyalty?

	<p>
	The Agamemnon would make a perfect plant.  Clark's people might have
	figured that Sheridan's emotional attachment to it would likely prompt
	him to put it in a position of trust, all the better to sabotage
	Sheridan's efforts at a critical juncture.  Of course, Ivanova isn't
	biased toward trusting the Agamemnon, but at the time the Agamemnon
	was sent out to find the rebel fleet, Clark had no idea Sheridan's
	capture was imminent.

	<p>
	Its arrival just after the battle was also very convenient; its
	captain could claim to be joining up with the rebels without actually
	having to fire on Clark's forces.  If it had indeed been chasing
	after Sheridan for weeks, emerging from hyperspace at just that
	moment was quite a coincidence.

<p>
   <li>@@@866618536 Was the Agamemnon's captain the one in command when it
	fired on the White Star?
	(<a href="052.html">"Messages From Earth"</a>)

<p>
   <li>@@@866950838 The Agamemnon has been involved in skirmishes with
	raiders near Io.  Who are the raiders?  Are the Drakh
	(<a href="077.html">"Lines of Communication"</a>)
	encroaching on Earth's territory?  Or are the raiders simply
	opportunists out to take advantage of Sheridan's campaign and its
	likely effect of drawing Earth forces away from their home system?

<p>
   <li>@@@865968823 The Shadows were apparently right about Ivanova; she is
	indeed taking Sheridan's place, just as Bester says they feared.

<p>
   <li>@@@866827988 Bester's manipulation of Garibaldi was foreshadowed in
	<a href="050.html">"Dust to Dust."</a>
	Bester told Garibaldi, "I enjoyed working with you.  We made a good
	team.  Perhaps we'll do it again sometime."

	<p>
	It was also foreshadowed, if obliquely, in
	<a href="041.html">"Divided Loyalties,"</a>
	in which Garibaldi <em>pretended</em> to have a personality implant,
	if only as a joke.

	<p>@@@867174664 
	And before then, ironically, in
	<a href="021.html">"The Quality of Mercy,"</a>
	Talia and Garibaldi shared a moment of mutual foreshadowing when she
	said to him, "Things that live inside us, Mr. Garibaldi.  Terrible
	things.  Terrible."

<p>
   <li>@@@866132660 Bester referred to the Corps as "my telepaths."  This
	echoes his comment to Ivanova in
	<a href="058.html">"Ship of Tears"</a>
	that he had plans for Earth's telepaths and didn't want the Shadows
	interfering.  Apparently he considers himself responsible for Earth's
	telepaths, even if he's not officially in charge of the Corps.

<p>
   <li>@@@865929593 Did Bester's people get the virus?  It's possible Lise took
	it when she fled Edgars' compound.  She wanted Garibaldi to help her
	stop him, and taking the virus would be a big step in that direction.
	Of course, that's assuming she could get to it; the Psi Cops could
	presumably take control of Edgars and force him to use the handprint
	reader, but Lise would have had a harder time getting to the vials.

	<p>
	Garibaldi did see blast marks around the secret compartment, though,
	suggesting that it was opened by force.

<p>
   <li>@@@866949231 The ISN broadcast showed investigators picking up a
	necklace from the floor of Edgars' residence.  That necklace, or one
	like it, was being worn by Lise when she listened in on Edgars'
	conversation with Garibaldi, suggesting she was in the room after
	Edgars and Garibaldi left.

<p>
   <li>@@@865972353 Bester's supposition that the virus was developed with
	the help of Shadow technology is consistent with the courier's claim in
	<a href="078.html">"Conflicts of Interest"</a>
	that coming up with the cure was a job beyond the capabilities of
	Earth's biologists, and that alien help had been enlisted.

<p>
   <li>@@@865978102 If Bester is right about the Shadows helping create the
	virus, it means Edgars was in contact with the Shadows, even if
	indirectly.  And indeed, Edgars and Wade seemed to espouse something
	like the Shadow philosophy: the enslavement of normals by telepaths or
	vice versa was a natural consequence of evolution.

<p>
   <li>@@@866303309 References to the Nazis abound: Edgars described his
	plan as a solution to "the telepath problem," an echo of Hitler's
	"Jewish problem."  Bester told Garibaldi that he had just prevented
	a Holocaust.  Edgars even referred to the Nazis directly, though he
	misspoke a date; he claimed they came to power in 1939, but in fact
	Hitler was appointed Chancellor in 1933.

<p>
   <li>@@@866346960 Garibaldi's line about the last person with his job being
	paid 30 pieces of silver is a
	<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Matthew+26:14-16">Biblical
	reference.</a>
	Judas was paid
	30 pieces of silver to betray Jesus to the Romans.  Even under the
	influence of his altered personality, Garibaldi apparently has moral
	qualms about betraying Sheridan.

<p>
   <li>@@@866393326 After Edgars told Garibaldi the full extent of his plans,
	Wade told Garibaldi he wouldn't be allowed to leave Edgars' compound.
	The implication was that any passing telepath (e.g. one of the
	"bloodhound units") would be able to scan Garibaldi and learn about
	the virus.

	<p>
	Why, then, was Wade allowed to travel to Babylon 5, and stay there to
	recruit Garibaldi? Was Wade unaware of the big picture until his return
	to Mars?  The laboratory scene near the end of
	<a href="082.html">"The Exercise of Vital Powers"</a>
	doesn't give the impression that Wade just found out what Edgars was
	up to; he seemed to have witnessed similar experiments in the past.

	<p>
	Perhaps Wade was drugged or brainwashed in some way that made him
	more difficult to scan or that caused him to believe the story he
	told Garibaldi in
	<a href="078.html">"Conflicts of Interest."</a>

<p>
   <li>@@@867090072 Bester's release of Garibaldi was, in some ways, an act
	of arrogance; in essence, Bester was saying that he didn't consider
	Garibaldi a threat.  Given Garibaldi's determination in the past, he'll
	likely seek revenge or justice, and he won't rest until he has it.

<p>
   <li>@@@867090072 Despite Bester's apparently accurate warning that
	Garibaldi's old comrades wouldn't want to have anything to do with him
	any more, Garibaldi did try to get in touch with Babylon 5.  How will
	he be able to prove his story to them, and prove that he's no longer
	under Bester's influence?  One obvious answer is to submit to a scan
	by Lyta, whose Vorlon-enhanced powers appear to far exceed Bester's.
	She would easily be able to verify Garibaldi's story, and her word
	might be enough to convince the others.

	<p>
	Edgars' order to Garibaldi to fire Lyta
	(<a href="080.html">"Moments of Transition"</a>)
	may, ironically, have been his downfall.  If Edgars hadn't forced
	Garibaldi to get rid of her, she might have eventually detected
	Bester's handiwork and removed it, and Edgars would still be alive.

<p>
   <li>@@@866044386 Why didn't Edgars release the virus?  What was he waiting
	for?  In
	<a href="082.html">"The Exercise of Vital Powers,"</a>
	he seemed satisfied that the virus worked, and even asked that a
	test of its effectiveness be terminated.

	<p>
	Since his aim was to control the telepaths, not simply wipe them out,
	perhaps he needed to wait until he had enough of the cure manufactured
	to supply to millions of victims.

	<p>
	Edgars said he was waiting for Clark to drop his guard, but it's
	not clear what difference that would have made; Clark's level of
	paranoia would presumably have little effect on the spread of the
	virus and the demise of the telepaths.

<p>
   <li>@@@865843518 Edgars' plans didn't amount to anything in the end.  He was
	the only known credible threat to the Psi Corps.  Now that he's dead
	and the Corps has control of his weapon against them, and Ivanova is
	continuing the rebel advance even in the face of Sheridan's capture,
	Edgars' fear of Clark panicking and giving increasing amounts of
	control to the Psi Corps may well become a reality.

	<p>
	Of course, Sheridan may have anticipated that problem, and
	the frozen telepaths may be his answer.

<p>
   <li>@@@867602156 In
	<a href="082.html">"The Exercise of Vital Powers,"</a>
	Edgars implied that there were other powerful megacorps dissatisfied
	with Clark, and that his company was one of several planning to move
	against the government.  Will any of the others act now that Edgars
	is out of the picture?

<p>
   <li>@@@865972353 The problem may have gotten even worse thanks to Edgars:
	if the Corps has the virus, they'll presumably spend a good
	deal of effort studying it.  The virus selects its victims via the
	presence of the telepathy genes.  Developing that selectivity from
	scratch may have required the aid of the Shadows, but it might not
	be beyond Earth's biotechnology to use it as a blueprint and produce
	a modified version that selects for the <em>lack</em> of the
	telepathy gene -- thus giving the Corps the same power over normals
	that Edgars wanted to gain over telepaths.

	<p>@@@866151770 
	Or the Corps could use the virus to cement its own control over all
	human telepaths.  By releasing the virus and only giving the cure to
	members of the Corps, they'd eliminate the problem of rogue telepaths
	overnight.  Latent telepaths like Ivanova would no longer be able to
	hide themselves from the Corps.

<p>
   <li>@@@868380941 Bester could possibly also use the virus on Lyta; death
	by the virus might be considered natural causes under the terms of her
	contract
	(<a href="080.html">"Moments of Transition."</a>)
	Of course, such an operation would be very risky, since Lyta would
	be contagious.

<p>
   <li>@@@866303491 Assuming Edgars kept detailed personnel records, the
	police will most likely look to Garibaldi as a prime suspect in the
	murders.  Lise might also be a suspect.  Both of them disappeared
	suddenly at the time of the murder, and given their past history,
	the police might conclude that Edgars' murder was a crime of passion
	committed by two old lovers who wanted to be together again.

<p>
   <li>@@@874306737 The bloodhound units may have been in evidence before
	this episode.  In
	<a href="078.html">"Conflicts of Interest,"</a>
	the two telepaths chasing Garibaldi, Wade and Lise seemed to fit the
	description pretty well.  And, more speculatively, they could have
	been the ones to plant the Keeper on Captain Jack in
	<a href="076.html">"Racing Mars,"</a>
	since they presumably would have had little trouble learning of his
	personal association with Number One.

<p>
   <li>@@@867904346 Lyta's description of the Corps' treatment of the murderer
	is strikingly similar to her threat to Londo in
	<a href="048.html">"Passing Through Gethsemane."</a>
	Perhaps she was present when the murderer was implanted and knows
	firsthand how to do such things.  Maybe she was even involved in
	the process; that could be the secret about her Bester threatened
	to reveal in
	<a href="073.html">"Epiphanies."</a>

<p>
   <li>@@@866304051 Number One said that when Lyta passed through Mars a
	year and a half earlier
	(<a href="041.html">"Divided Loyalties"</a>)
	she made no mention of being a telepath on the run from the Corps.
	That's inconsistent with Lyta's story in that episode.  She told
	Sheridan and the others at that time that she'd been helping out
	the resistance, and implied that they'd hired her for her telepathic
	skills.

<p>
   <li>@@@866948542 Number One apparently really <em>does</em> treat all
	her former lovers like she treated Phillipe
	(<a href="077.html">"Lines of Communication."</a>)

<p>
   <li>@@@866442821 One thing I've been doing with the latter part of
	season 4 is to experiment a little more, try different things.  I feel
	that we need to push visually to try new things, the sort of visual
	techniques you don't see much in SF-TV, which for the most part is
	fairly prosaic as these things go. And to push the writing, to try some
	things that may succeed, or may fail, but you learn something either

	different direction.

	<p>
	Mike Vejar definitely did a great job with this episode.

<p>
   <li>@@@866619976 Zimbalist did a great job for us...he took huge gobs of

<p>
   <li>@@@866620147 <em>Was he a fan of the show?</em><br>
	Nope, just figured he'd be great for the job, and cast him
	without audition.  He didn't know anything about the show before that.

<p>
   <li>@@@866620147 <em>What was the shimmering wall Sheridan stood near on
	the White Star bridge?</em><br>
	Those were the autorepair systems at work.

<p>
   <li>@@@866620147 ""The Face of the Enemy" might represent the flipside of
	young Delenn's claim in "Atonement" that the most dangerous enemy is the
	one you know nothing about.  Now the face of the enemy is the one you

	that the face is actually a mask."

	<p>
	Yep.  It's one thing facing implacable, vast enemies...it's
	quite another when you friend betrays you.  That's personal.

<p>
   <li>@@@866617854 There isn't that much direct,
	personal violence in the show.  My feeling is that if you do that a
	lot, it loses any potential for impact.  You only pull out that card
	when you really need it, to best effect...don't waste it.  It's like
	harsh language, after you've heard someone going on using all the more
	remarkable Anglo-Saxon words for a while, it loses all impact.

   <li>@@@866618128 "I thought the fight was a bit too long for much the
	same reason as you. All I can suggest is that John's metabolism isn't
	"normal" any more, and perhaps this had an effect. (And maybe the
	bullyboys were doing less damage than we think, simply to prolong
	the "fun".)"

	<p>
	1) It was for dramatic/stylistic effect.  Not everything done
	with some style has to have a scientific explanation.

	<p>
	2) Having been mugged myself, time expands and slows down.

	<p>
	3) It's the TV cliche that fights are over in a second.  Ask
	anyone who's ever been in a real knock-down fight.  It goes on a heck
	of a lot longer than we showed here.  When I got mugged it went on for
	10 minutes.

	<p>
	One of the ironies in other messages on this (not this one here
	specifically) is that some have noted the fast-paced editing, which is
	supposedly associated with music video/short attention span
	material...and then turn around and say it wasn't over fast enough.

   <li>@@@866044536 <em>Was Lyta's story the secret from her past alluded
	to by Bester in
	<a href="073.html">"Epiphanies?"</a></em><br>
	No, Franklin's comment to Lyta didn't involve her past, though
	we will find out more about that in a bit.

<p>
   <li>@@@866619976 <em>Was Bester's salute a "Prisoner" reference?</em><br>
	Nope, not a Prisoner homage at all, in any way.

<p>
   <li>@@@866619976 <em>Why mess Edgars' place up so thoroughly?</em><br>
	They wanted it to look like it was done by the Resistance;
	too much "attention" to his death would've drawn attention to the
	Corps.

<p>
   <li>@@@866443179 Wade specificially says Lise wasn't there when they got
	back, so that eliminates her from the scenario.

<p>
   <li>@@@866617855 <em>Why haven't the other races had conflict between
	their telepaths and their normals?</em><br>
	Obviously some, like the Minbari, dealt with it more easily than
	others; and in some places it came through Vorlon interference, while
	in others it came about naturally.

<p>
   <li>@@@866949468 "Wade had a great line about the clash of homo sapiens
	and Neanderthals in Carthage.  Was this line inspired by some of the
	recent Neanderthal finds? Or was this part of your orignial
	conception for the story?"

	<p>
	Not recent stuff, just a general knowledge of this area.

	<p>
	"Did Edgars really believe the Earthgov propaganda that Sheridan was
	operating under the malignant influence of aliens?

	<p>
	Nope.

	<p>
	"Is Bester really done with Garibaldi?"

	<p>
	For the moment.

	<p>
	"One of the captains of the Earth vessels is named Leo Frank.  Was
	this a deliberate historical reference?"

	<p>
	Not intentionally.

	<p>
	"Franklin and Number One seem to have cooled their relationship.
	Any further developments in the works here?"

	<p>
	Any more personal stuff got set aside when Franklin showed up
	a) with another female, and b) she was a teep.  When #1 calms
	down, they might take another shot at it.

	<p>
	"Lastly, there is a bit of irony in the fact that the stage for
	Sheridan's capture is set when he steps aboard his old ship, the
	Agamemnon.  Agamemnon was the supreme commander of the Greek forces
	at Troy, who survived that long war, but who was betrayed and
	murdered by his wife when he returned home. He blindly and arrogantly
	stepped into a trap, as Sheridan also seemed to do."

	<p>
	Yeah...that's one of many reasons why I picked that
	image/reference. It plays on a LOT of levels in the story.

<p>
   <li>@@@866999604 <em>Wasn't Edgars' complex guarded to keep people from
	leaving without permission?</em><br>
	If anybody could slip away, Garibaldi could.

<p>
   <li>@@@867904437 <em>Ivanova quoted Sheridan as saying, "The person is
	expendable.  The job is not."  But in fact, it was Sinclair who
	said that, in
	<a href="060.html">"War Without End."</a></em><br>
	But then, if I did everything perfectly, wouldn't it be boring?
