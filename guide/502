<h2><a name="BP">Plot Points</a></h2>
<ul>

   <li>@@@929645109 Galen was taken in by Elric
	(<a href="025.html">"The Geometry of Shadows"</a>)
	after Galen's father died.  Elric died shortly after the technomages
	reached their hiding place.

   <li>@@@929645109 Galen isn't the only technomage who disagrees with
	the group's decision to go into hiding.

</ul>

<h2><a name="UQ">Unanswered Questions</a></h2>
<ul>

   <li>@@@929645109 What did Alwyn mean when he said darkness was coming?

   <li>@@@929645109 How many other technomages split off from the group and
	are wandering around the universe?

</ul>

<h2><a name="AN">Analysis</a></h2>
<ul>

   <li>@@@929645109 Could Alwyn really have destroyed ships in orbit?
	Clearly Gideon's use of the Excalibur's main gun was the backup
	plan advocated by Galen, so it's plausible that Alwyn's preparations
	were little more than a light show in reality.

   <li>@@@930036047 Gideon referred to Alwyn as a technomage while speaking
	to Captain Daniels; Daniels didn't seem surprised to hear the term.
	How widespread is knowledge of the technomages?

</ul>

<h2><a name="NO">Notes</a></h2>
<ul>

   <li>@@@929645109 Alwyn was played by Edward Woodward, father of Peter
	Woodward, who plays Galen.

   <li>@@@929645109 Marshall Teague is a longtime B5 actor; he guest-starred
	as Nelson Drake in the very first hourlong episode filmed,
	<a href="004.html">"Infection,"</a>
	and later played Ta'Lon, the Narn who eventually succeeded G'Kar
	as ambassador to B5.

</ul>

<h2><a name="JS">jms speaks</a></h2>
<ul>

   <li>@@@930036445 It's a favorite of mine...nice character and humor
	stuff.

<p>
   <li>@@@930036188 "By that I mean have the technomages always had
	abilities just slightly ahead of their contemporaries (and used in a
	way to APPEAR miraculous), or have they had the benefit of technology
	from another civilization?"

	<p>
	This is a question that we were going to build, and answer, in
	the latter part of the first season...a lot of which will also be in
	the 3 technomage novels.

</ul>
