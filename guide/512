<h2><a name="BP">Plot Points</a></h2>
<ul>

<p>
   <li>@@@935999889 A few hundred years ago, the inhabitants of an unknown
	planet began to pick up broadcasts from other worlds, including Earth.
	The planet was undergoing a constant series of civil wars at the time,
	so its government hatched a plan to create a scapegoat for its domestic
	problems: fabricate fake visits by humans and establish the appearance
	of a conspiracy to cover up the "truth."  The plan worked; when the
	people believed that the government was secretly under alien control,
	revolting no longer seemed useful, and the civil wars came to an end.

	<p>
	After learning of that conspiracy, Gideon took the Excalibur to the
	planet and dropped a series of probes near several large cities,
	each containing a copy of the Interstellar Encyclopedia as well as the
	details of what he'd learned about the nature of the coverup.

<h2><a name="AN">Analysis</a></h2>
<ul>

<p>
   <li>@@@935999889 The alien world must be quite close to Earth.  If, as
	claimed, they first started picking up human transmissions a couple
	hundred years before the encounter with the Excalibur (and assuming the
	alien year isn't substantially different than an Earth year) that would
	mean they first started receiving the broadcasts no later than about
	the mid-21st century.  That would put their world within about 150
	light-years of Earth, since the first video signals from Earth were
	sent in the early 1900s and travelled at lightspeed.

</ul>

<h2><a name="NO">Notes</a></h2>
<ul>

   <li>@@@935999889 The new telepath regulations permit Matheson to project
	thoughts into another being's mind in life-or-death situations.

   <li>@@@935999889 Gideon enjoys feeling the wind on his face when he's
	visiting a planet.

   <li>@@@935999889 This episode is a parody of the TV series
	<a href="http://www.thex-files.com/">"The X-Files."</a>
	References to that show abound:

	<ul>
	   <li> The subtitle showing the location and time (Eridani Sector,
		May 13, 2267 2:37PM EST) is ubiquitous on "The X-Files."
	   <li> The red color of Lyssa's tentacles suggests Agent Scully's
		red hair.
	   <li> Cell phones are a constant presence on "The X-Files."
	   <li> Kendarr's cigarette addiction is like that of the Cigarette
		Smoking Man, one of the heads of the "X-Files" conspiracy.
	   <li> The "Y" in masking tape on Durkani's office window is a
		reference to the "X" Mulder placed on his window in early
		"X-Files" episodes when he wanted to contact Deep Throat.
	   <li> The alien wearing a human mask under an alien mask is a
		reference to the X-Files episode, "Jose Chung's 'From Outer
		Space.'"
	   <li> Arguably, Durkani's name is a variant on "Duchovny."
	   <li> Durkani's closing line, "The truth is out..." and Kendarr's
		conclusion, "...out of fashion," is a reference to the
		X-Files tagline, "The Truth is Out There."
	</ul>

   <li>@@@936119636 In addition, there are references to real-life conspiracy
	theories:

	<ul>
	   <li> The photo of Mount Rushmore is a reference to the
		<a href="http://barsoom.msss.com/education/facepage/face.html">Face on Mars</a>.
	   <li> The report of a crashed Earth ship, with human bodies
		taken away and the whole thing explained away as a weather
		balloon, is a reference to the crash in
		<a href="http://www.roswell.org/">Roswell, New Mexico</a>
		in 1947.
	   <li> The blimp being dismissed as "swamp gas" mirrors a frequent
		explanation for UFO sightings.
	</ul>

</ul>

<ul>

   <li>@@@936119636 "I'm glad to see somewhat else comment on the 'Y' in
	the window. That was absolutely classic -- and pure Joe!"

	<p>
	Y makes it the show right next door to that other show....
