titled "Watch for," follows, a non-spoiler list of things to pay special
attention to while watching.  Then, after a dividing line, the spoiler
section of the guide page proceeds as usual.  This new format, as it's
retrofitted onto the old episodes, should make the Guide more useful when
viewing episodes for the first time.
