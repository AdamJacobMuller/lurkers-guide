<p>
CITY-TV is allegedly working on buying rights to season five.

<p>
The "Space"
cable channel is also in negotiations to show B5; they ask that viewers please
not contact them about it.  It's being worked on already and they have
limited staff to answer the hundreds of E-mail messages they get on the
subject -- they're already quite exasperated by the flow of "Is there news
yet?" mail.  If and when there's news from them you'll see it here.

<h4>Station Notes</h4>

<p>
<a name="midnote">If a station airs B5 at midnight,</a>
it is listed for the actual day it airs, thus 'Sun 12:00am' is late night
Saturday.

<p>
*   Stations with an '*' have been known to move B5 around a lot for sports,
    so double check your listings to make sure when things are in season.
