The pilot, "The Gathering," was set in the year 2257;
Babylon 5 had recently come online.  The last of the ambassadors,
Kosh, arrived on the station, prompting an assassination attempt.  Sinclair
was framed for the attempt, but was eventually cleared when the real culprit
-- a Minbari -- was discovered.  Many mysteries were introduced: Sinclair's
missing 24 hours on the Battle of the Line (with the announcement by the
Minbari that "there is a hole in your mind"); the mystery of Kosh, seen
only by the doctor and the telepath; and the disappearance or destruction
of the previous four Babylon stations.
